106,44,1989,VUT,"﻿Mr. President, ascending the steps which lead to this podium# and speaking before the United Nations General Assembly is always a great honour and privilege. Today this honour and privilege take on added significance for our delegation. I have the pleasure of conveying to you, and to the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria# congratulations and best wishes on your unanimous election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.
Furthermore# I have the honour of conveying to you a personal congratulatory message from Father Halter Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu. The Prime Minister: sends his fondest regards to you, a friend and a man he knows to be not only a proud son of Nigeria, but also a proud son of Vanuatu. We recall that the honorary title of ,Chief, was bestowed upon you at a custom ceremony during a visit you made to Vanuatu in 1985, in your capacity as Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. Thus Nigeria's pride and joy on your election is shared by Vanuatu. I will resist, for the sake of life, repeating the many words already spoken In praise of your diplomatic experience and skills. Instead, I will merely associate out delegation and myself with those words and the sentiments they express. We prefer to draw attention to four words, which those of us are privileged to know you personally find most appropriate in describing you. Those four words are: sincerity, courage, dignity, and integrity. Those four qualities make you not only a proud son of your country and of Africa, but also of all those who cherish those virtues.
We join in the tribute paid to the Group of African States, particularly to the Governments of Cameroon and Egypt, by the Minister of External Affairs of Nigeria, when he addressed the General Assembly and expressed gratitude for the African consensus which led to your election. Furthermore, we associate ourselves with the very moving words of appreciation we have heard you address to our dear friend and brother, Mr. Paul Bamela Hugo, the Permanent Representative of Cameroon  What you expressed on that occasion, Mr. President - with which we concur - were fat more than the usual sentiments.
We welcome the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Ronald I. Spiers - a distinguished diplomat - to his new poet, and we wish him well. We also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo, former Foreign Minister of Argentina, for a job well done. His presidency coincided with certain historic developments which have contributed to a new atmosphere that we must now profit from in our efforts to strengthen the United Nations, and prospects for justice and lasting world peace. 
There is no doubt that, in a real sense, the current international climate is far better than it has ever been within the lifetime of most of those who now inhabit this planet. We now have a chance finally to cross the threshold and ensure that mankind will not, through a nuclear conflict between the two super-Powers intentionally destroy life as we know it. None the less, many major problems continue to plague mankind, and we believe that sincerity, courage, dignity and integrity continue to be essential qualities in the process of building and preserving justice, peace and a better world for every roan, woman and child in every corner of the globe.
We welcome and applaud the new openness, mutual respect and generally friendlier atmosphere that characterize current relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, we would be less than true to ourselves, and to history, were we to forget that many of the things that plague mankind today are not consequences of the post-Second-World-War antagonisms between these two great countries but, instead, result from old contradictions and grievances that predate the cold war and reveal the imperfections of the human species, as well as of the various institutions we have shaped.
An astute observer once remarked, ,Man's mad vanity is often mocked by life,. Thus, while some raced recklessly to build and deploy newer and more powerful weapons of mass destruction, nature demonstrated, with repeated regularity, that it could outdo mankind by in leashing hurricanes, cyclones, earthquakes, floods and droughts that gave us more than enough death and devastation - if that was what we wanted. While some experimented with, and developed  silent killers, such as chemical and bacteriological agents, nature gave us more than enough infectious disease  to satisfy any longing we might have to inflict pain and suffering on other human beings. While some obsessively consumed addictive drugs with hedonistic fervour# nature revealed that, eventually, those consumers become themselves consumed by their obsession.
While some raced selfishly to build temples of pagan idolatry to material wealth, with little regard for the future well-being of our planet, nature responded to the repeated violation of our environment the only way it could - by revealing how scarce are the earth's resources, and how precarious its ability to support and sustain life. While some have expended their energy in misguided efforts to deny the humanity of others, merely because of differences in skin pigmentation, religious beliefs, cultural nuances, language or gender, nature has repeatedly revealed that if we cannot now be united in life we will most assuredly be forever united in death.
It is time for us all to realize that if every one of us does not have a future none of us shall have a future. Thus, the Foreign Minister of the Philippines, Mr. Raul S. Manglapus, spoke for us all - not only for the poor people of his country - when, on 27 September 1989, he so eloquently stated, among other things t
,Today a human being is born not only with original sin but also with
original debt., (A/44/PV.9, p. 38)
This chilling reality, substantiated by the fact that the developing world now- owes the developed world more than $1.3 trillion, portends a future without hope for most of the world's people. Furthermore, this debt, which has already reached unmanageable proportions, continues to grow and grow and grow, with no apparent end in sight.
We would be hard-pressed to recall a recent international meeting at which a discussion of the debt crisis, end other aspects of a general appeal for economic justice, had not played a prominent role. There are some encouraging signs that the urgency of this message has finally begun to penetrate. However, every day that this problem is left unresolved in a comprehensive fashion by the international community and the developing countries of the world nearer to an economic abyss and a potentially devastating social apocalypse.
№>t all of the economic ills of the developing countries result from the actions - or lade of action - of the developed world. Naturally, developing countries must shoulder a fair share of the responsibility for the general malaise that exists in so many of their own economies. However, deteriorating terms of trade - characterized by severely depressed commodity prices, reverse flows of capital, and increasing protectionist pressures - have, for most of the world, made appeals for international economic justice a matter of great urgency.
Greater fiscal responsibility and restraint are needed, but certainly not at the expense of those who are the most disadvantaged in the various developing countries. This would not only be Impolite it would also be immoral.
Ironically, those who are among the first to counsel the adoption of rather severe fiscal restraints with respect to the social sectors of developing countries are often among the last to adopt far milder restraints themselves when it comes to military expenditures for new methods of death and destruction. Developing countries generally find It difficult to obtain sufficient economic credits to develop social Infrastructure. The same countries usually find it easier to obtain economic credits to fuel excessive military expenditures.
While some nations were busy devoting considerable resources and energy to building and maintaining elaborate military defences against real and Imagined external enemies, another, less manageable and more Insidious, foe of us all was also busy. This foe developed an ability to threaten us all; regardless of our size regardless of our wealth, regardless of our power, regardless of our professed beliefs. This foe respects no international border, no set of laws, and no boundaries of decency. This foe is as brutal, as principled and as immoral as was an earlier foe - the international traffic in human beings known is the slave trade. Today's foe - the international traffic in narcotic drugs - poses a clear and present danger to contemporary civilized society. What it cannot seduce, it attempts to corrupt  what it cannot corrupt, it attempts to intimidate} what it cannot intimidate, it attempts to Hill and destroy.
Those who engage in this traffic deserve neither our sympathy nor our mercy. They are evil incarnate, and must be confronted with all means at our disposal, just as the slave traders of earlier generations were confronted by decent human beings and civilized Governments and institutions, and just as latter-day practitioners of genocide were confronted by the international community during the Second World War, and later at International tribunals, which for ever contented crimes against humanity.
Today, the courage of the Government and people of Colombia presents us with an historic challenge. Should we fail to meet that challenge - should we allow Colombia to stand alone in Its confrontation with evil - we shall have written the epitaph of modern civilization. The message of Mr. Virgilio Barco, President of Colombia, delivered here at the General Assembly on 29 September 1989, moved us all to stand in unison and applaud. Let that message also lead us to stand in unison and fight for the future of our respective peoples - for the future of our children.
A young playwright, raised in a section of our host city that was recently in the news, has crafted a work striking in its similarities to a tragic event that occurred recently in his former neighbourhood. The plot of his play centres on an act of mindless racial violence and exposes the raw emotions of the play's characters. At the play's conclusion, a man who had stood by and watched the fatal beating of the black victim is surprised by the reaction of his girlfriend. To exculpate himself  he exclaims 
,... life is short. The past is past. Let's worry about us. When the bomb hits, we're all going to die anyways.,
She pointedly replies t
,The world's not going to end with a bomb. It's going to end with people like you standing around doing nothing.,
One week after the play went into rehearsal, a tragic and much-publicized killing occurred in the community where the author had been raised and where the play was set. The theme of the play could just as easily have been about the international community's inaction in the face of drug trafficking it could just as easily have been about how the world has stood around watching the violent disintegration of Lebanon  it could just as easily have been about how some of us have stood around watching the intifadah in the occupied territories of Palestine. The theme of the play could just as easily have been about those who have been satisfied to be spectators each time the people of South Africa have demonstrated that they have had  ore than their fill of apartheid. The there could just as easily have been about those who chose to be spectators when the people of Namibia, the people of Hew Caledonia, or the people of other Non-Self-Governing Territories, decided to reclaim their own identities, their own sovereignty  their own futures.
In this regard, we note the very moving appeal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, Mr. de Deus Pinheiro, that the international community not rent in indifferent to the situation in East Timor. The Government and the people of Vanuatu will never be indifferent to conditions in East Timor, Western Sahara, or other small Territories which some tend to overlook when they assess the current state of international relations. To us, the world has not progressed nearly as far as we would like to believe, if the peoples of those small Territories are not allowed freely to express their will and determine their r perspective futures.
Closer to Vanuatu's own shores, the people of New Caledonia and the Government of Trance have embarked on an imaginative initiative  hid  could prove capable of providing a framework for a genuine act of self-determination and a just and lasting solution to the trouble -plagued history of that South Pacific Territory. We continue to support an early transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of New Cal® dm la's colonized people.
The Reads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries continue to view the decolonisation process as an important international priority. At the Ninth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries, held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia  the Heads of State or Government reiterated and reaffirmed their commitment to the process by which most of the countries represented here today have won their political independence. On the specific subject of New Caledonia they ,strongly urged that the question ... be kept under active consideration at the United Nations until the conditions for an internationally acceptable act of self-determination} in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations, have been met.,
The important process of dialogue has led to the restoration of peace and a calm political atmosphere in New Caledonia. As a neighbouring country Vanuatu applauds the measures taken to end the violence and reform the old social order. We will continue to support the process under way in New Caledonia so long as its people continue to work within that framework, and to view that process as a vehicle for the political evolution of their country.
We are grateful for the understanding and support received from the international community on this issue. We know it is not always easy to understand and appreciate all of the nuances emanating from cries for justice by the people of a small Territory in a distant region. We also know it is not always easy - owing to other constraints and limitations - for a great Power to respond in a positive manner. France has demonstrated a greatness, as well as courage and compassion, by its willingness to listen to the grievances of New Caledonia's people, and by its willingness be fashion bold new initiatives in an effort to address those grievances.
Nothing would please us more than to believe that the Government of South Africa is now possessed of the greatness, the courage, and the compassion to live up to its various undertakings to promote the decolonization of Namibia, and to help forge a new South Africa built on honesty, justice, and equality. However, w· share the scepticism of those who doubt the sincerity of the current rulers of Pretoria. 
Namibia is on its way to independence despite the many road-blocks erected by the apartheid regime. He rejoice at the prospect of an independent Namibia assuming its rightful place within the community of nations. However# the rest of the world must assure that South Africa lives up to its commitments and not just those it finds convenient.
With respect to South Africa itself it is clear that apartheid is doomed.
This discredited doctrine of racial superiority has been repudiated by all# save those whose hearts and minds still reside in the early decades of the nineteenth century when the ownership of one human being by another was a socially acceptable method of attaining wealth and power.
Today# those who imprisoned Nelson Mandela find that in his confinement he is freer than they are as his gaolers. His freedom is the freedom of a dignity that could never be diminished a will that could never be broken a conscience that could never be compromised. The confinement of his gaolers is the moral confinement of those who are consumed by nothing but greed and hatred.
Those who govern South Africa attempted the impossible. They attempted the indefinite imprisonment of an entire country. Such repression nay succeed temporarily but history teaches that such success is always short-lived. Today# the largest gaolbreak in history is occurring. Soon South Africa will be free, and all of that country's people can share its wealth and will share its future.
Hurricane Hugo which recently battered the Eastern Caribbean and parts of the United States has added its name to the long list of natural disasters that continue to plague mankind. He extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of Hugo and join in appeals for emergency and long-term assistance to help rebuild what was destroyed. As horrible as the consequences of the hurricane were  however t we cannot help but note that for some unfathomable reason, mankind still seems determined to match or even exceed nature in its destructive capabilities. The follies of mankind appear to have no limits.
Thus while we mourn the victims of hurricane Hugo# nuclear testing continues in the South Pacific. Why? He cannot understand. Every delegation that has participated in the general debate has commented on a new positive international atmosphere and greatly enhanced prospects for world peace. Why, then must the people of the South Pacific continue to see their environment violated by the testing of nuclear weapons? For what conflict are these weapons necessary?
Against whom have the peace-loving peoples of the Pacific sinned? Why must our lands  our waters* and our skies be used to test weapons that the people of no other region want tested on their lands  in their waters  or in their skies?
We are pleased by recent expressions of concern for the environment. However  we find considerable irony in these expressions of concern. We are waiting for new voices to join us in appealing for an end to nuclear testing in our environment. We are waiting for new voices to join us in appealing for an end to the dumping of hazardous materials in our environment. We are waiting for new voices to join us in an appeal for an immediate end to the drift-net fishing that is devastating our marine ecology. We are waiting for new voice  to join us in appealing for a more equitable and universal distribution of the resources that have already been extracted from the Earth.
We will continue to raise and articulate our strong environmental concerns. We will do so not to keep pace with any existing fashion  nor because of a new awareness of how fragile is the thread by which the environment supports life on this planet. We will do so because of our traditional respect for the very delicate balance of life we call our environment. We  ill do so because of our concern for the future  and because we know that our children - and their children - have no other place to go but the four corners of the Earth. We will do so because we do not want our world to end as a result of too many of us doing nothing - or not enough - when so much needs to be done.  
"
108,44,1989,PNG,"﻿On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, I congratulate Mr. Garba of Nigeria on his unanimous election to the important post of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under his able leadership the challenging work before the Assembly will be carried to its conclusion with efficiency and success. I should also like to register Papua New Guinea's sincere appreciation of the excellent job accomplished by his predecessor, Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina.
In addition, let me add my Government's voice to the voices of those who have already spoken in praise of the commendable work being done by the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, and his staff in implementing United Nations programmes. Papua New Guinea continues to regard the United Nations as having a unique role in working for the relaxation of tensions, the resolution of conflicts and the building of a strong framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding. Papua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to achieving this objective.
My delegation attends this session with the hope that we shall collectively take advantage of the opportunities before us to hasten the realization of the global environment that the founders of the United Nations envisaged for us and future generations.
We have before us this year another complex agenda which, among other things, points to an international community saddled with a great number of problems. Some of these problems date back to before the United Nations was even established. Yet it is the responsibility of the Assembly to work for the resolution of those problems. The uncertainty that they cause is felt by all of us, and for many developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, has a direct impact on our development efforts. But there is still some hope and optimism. Papua New Guinea believes with a good measure of confidence that positive steps have been taken in dealing with the problems which are the subject of this session's attention.
My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his tireless efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We note with considerable satisfaction his comprehensive report, which records process being made in resolving regional tensions and conflicts, among them those in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Namibia, apartheid South Africa, Western Sahara and Central America, and the Iran-Iraq conflict. The report also underscores the efforts being made to tackle other pressing issues, including the environment, disarmament, trade, finance, debt servicing and human rights.
Our own region, the South Pacific, is relatively free of major conflicts, but is nevertheless an area which is being given increasing attention by other countries and international organizations. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions elsewhere and the worrying trends in the world economy.
The community of the South Pacific comprises mainly small island States scattered in the vast Pacific Ocean. Our struggle is one of survival, a struggle to develop our people and national economies with the limited financial and technical resources available to us while at the same time keeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and the environment free of nuclear and other activities which could harm, if not destroy, our region's resources, including the most important source of livelihood for most island communities - fish and marine resources.
Since our independence in 1975 we have actively pursued the cause of decolonisation in the South Pacific. Most of our region has been decolonised, but there are some island communities whose future is still uncertain.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the progress being made by the Government of France in bringing political and administrative reforms to New Caledonia through the Matiqnon and other agreements signed between the French Government and the different political groups in the Territory. But we believe that the pace of change must be hastened and a clear commitment made for bringing the Territory to independence as soon as possible. Papua New Guinea regrets the tragic loss of Mr. Jean-Marie Tjibaou, President of the FLNKS, and his deputy, Mr. Yeiwene, on 4 May 1989. The deaths of the late President Tjibaou, Mr. Yeiwene and others who have championed the cause of independence in the Territory for so long and over the years made extensive representations within and outside the United Nations on behalf of their Territory, and who were among those who signed the Matignon agreements, show that more needs to be done by the Government of France to bring about changes 'which conform with the aspirations of the people of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous Kanaks.
Both these leaders were men of great vision, strength and wisdom They made great sacrifices for the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. We pay tribute to then, and we know that their just struggle will not end.
New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self Governing Territories, following a decision of the Assembly in December 1986. The Assembly therefore has a continuing responsibility to monitor developments in the Territory closely. The Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, this year 'Strongly urged that the question of New Caledonia be kept under active consideration at the United Nations until the conditions for an internationally acceptable act of self-determination, in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations, have been met'. We also hope that the Administering Authority, in France, will comply fully with all its obligations as provided for in the United Nations Charter, and with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).
Papua New Guinea has also welcomed recent progress made under the Compact arrangements between the United States and the Micronesian islands. We have moved forward in establishing diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. But we also look forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues affecting Palau's political future.
In the South Pacific, Papua New Guinea is equally concerned about protection of the environment. On 10 August this year, Papua New Guinea ratified two important treaties which seek to protect our environment - namely, the South
Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the Convention for the Protection of the Environment and Resources of the South Pacific. Taken as a package together with fisheries and other economic arrangements that are being progressively put in place, they represent important corner-stones for the protection of the environment in the South Pacific region, and for the management and development of its vast marine resources in accordance with the interests of the island communities. My Government intends to work closely with our partners in the South Pacific to fully implement these treaty arrangements, and, like those partners, we shall strongly - and especially oppose, France's continued nuclear-testing programme at Mururoa Atoll and all the other activities that are harmful to the resources and livelihood of our people.
Such regional initiatives deserve the full and active support of the United Nations. They form part of the wider international concern about, and the action now being taken to protect, the global environment.
The Government of Papua New Guinea applauds the decision of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify two of the three Protocols to the South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty. We strongly urge other nuclear-weapons States, including France, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ratify the Protocols and respect the operations of this Treaty and other environmental arrangements in the South Pacific.
In regional fisheries, a successful regional fisheries agreement between the United States and the countries members of the South Pacific Forum,, signed in 1987, is already contributing to the development of our fisheries resources. We are prepared to enter into similar arrangements with other major fishing nations, on the basis of fair and equitable returns for island States and principles designed to protect and carefully manage the fisheries resources and our environment. We urge the Government of Jap* to co-operate in unlocking the stalled negotiations on a regional fisheries arrangement with island States.
Consistent with the declaration made in July this year by the leaders of the South Pacific Forum, we also call on Japan and other distant-water-fishing nations to cease completely the harmful method of qill-net fishing often referred to as the 'wall of death' in the South Pacific. We are convinced that such a destructive and indiscriminate fishing practice will, if not halted, increasingly diminish our peoples* opportunities and chances not only of a livelihood but of survival in the future.
Fisheries, trade development, transport and communications are among the major economic activities being pursued by island States and regional organizations established within the region, in our efforts to improve the welfare of our people and strengthen our wider connections with the international community. Papua New Guinea strongly supports the work of regional organizations in the South Pacific as well as other international agencies, including United Nations agencies, which collaborate closely with them in bringing development to our region.
Papua New Guinea's interest extends beyond the South Pacific region. Our foreign policy seeks to expand and diversify relationships with countries Members of the United Nations. Significant progress is already being made towards this commitment in the Asian region.
We highly value our growing links with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN is an impressive regional organization, which continues to promote understanding and co-operation in the South-East Asian region and elsewhere, through, among other things, the taking of constructive regional initiatives on issues such as Cambodia. Papua New Guinea has special observer statue at annual meetings off ASSAM foreign ministers. We are pleased that our relationship with ASEAN has been further strengthened this year through Papua Hew Guinea's accession on ? July 1989 to the Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation in South-East Asia.
As I said earlier the agenda for this session is a complex one. A significant number of items quite rightly deal with initiatives to reduce international tensions and to promote the cause of peace and security. Papua New Guinea strongly supports international efforts to reduce tensions and the number of conflicts.
We especially commend the leaderships in Moscow and in Washington. They have in recent years worked with a deep sense of commitment towards reducing international tensions, and we welcome their further commitment at this session to eliminate chemical weapons. We commend their efforts on disarmament. But we urge them to go even further. 
Their efforts in particular contributed to the climate of optimism that became evident at last year's session of the General Assembly, and have contributed to the maintenance of that climate this year. Their efforts and those of others, particularly members of the Security Council, must be supported if there is to be any further meaningful progress in the solution of problems in Cambodia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, the Korean peninsula, Namibia and southern Africa.
Papua New Guinea welcomes signals off Vietnamese troop withdrawals from Cambodia and hopes that the commitment this entails will be fulfilled, including free elections supervised by the United Nations, and that the people off Cambodia will reassert their identity and return to democracy, peace and tranquillity, and socio-economic progress.
The situation in the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. At independence, Papua New Guinea established formal diplomatic ties with both the Republic of Korea sad the Democratic Republic of Korea. Our links with the Republic of Korea have developed more rapidly. But our commitment is to support initiatives by both Koreas for the peaceful reunification of their people. Papua New Guinea urges the Governments of both Koreas to maintain active dialogue in working for understanding, reconciliation and efforts to achieve the peaceful unification of the Korean people. We note with great interest the proposals contained in fee address of President Roh Tae Wco on 11 September 1989 concerning national unification. The declaration, we believe, sets a constructive has is for discussions which could lead to early reunification. I reiterate again that fee Government of Papua New Guinea supports the admission of both North and South Korea as full Members of fee United Nations. Their admission, we believe, has fee potential to open up additional avenues towards dialogue, co-operation and understanding.
Papua New Guinea continues to believe that efforts Made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict in the Middle East oust continue. My Government commends the parties - including the United Nations - involved in this important process. Papua New Guinea reaffirms its belief that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secured borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting resolution of the tensions and conflicts in the Middle East. The problem of apartheid and the related colonial situation imposed by the racist regime of South Africa still exist in spite of numerous efforts by this body and other United Nations agencies. Papua New Guinea is of the firm belief that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds good prospects foe success both in dismantling apartheid and in achieving the independence of Namibia.
With regard to global trade and the economic developments that have taken place in the recent past, we note that the industrialized countries have moved towards structural adjustment policies to address the issues of low growth and high inflation through the liberalization of trade, the elimination of industrial and agricultural subsidies and the creation of employment opportunities. We also note that many developing countries have experienced not only slow and stagnant economic growth but debt problems as well. As a result of these continuing economic difficulties many developing countries, including Papua New Guinea, have undertaken stringent economic policies and programmes to maintain sustainable economic growth.
While there has been progress in some of those areas, Papua New Guinea, with a developing and agriculturally based economy, is concerned that the effects of protectionist pressure exercised by industrialized economies on some of our
strategic agricultural export commodities have adversely influenced our national plans and efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth. It is therefore imperative that the efforts of the global community, through the United Nations and its agencies as well as the current Uruguay Round of negotiations, should be strengthened to address such trade practices and distortions in order to ensure balanced, liberalised and fair trade between the countries in the international market.
In conclusion, my delegation believes that the most important and pressing issue in the world today is the question of peace and development. Peace is the pre-condition for economic development through the expansion of international co-operation. Only in an international environment of peace and stability can the economic development of all nations be enhanced. Papua New Guinea therefore attaches great importance to international efforts aimed at achieving peace, harmony and development in the world. He also fully support efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism, debt servicing and the slowing down of financial transfers to developing countries.
Papua New Guinea has taken note of the overwhelming support delegations have given to the need for and effectiveness of the United Nations system. While there can be some criticisms about the Organisation's ability to deal with problems affecting the international community, ray delegation believes that there are positive signs that the United Nations network of agencies has been given a chance to work. A considerable amount of momentum has developed within the United Nations in tackling and seeking solutions to some of the world's problems. We must all take full advantage of these opportunities.

"
117,44,1989,AUS,"﻿
Allow me to begin by warmly congratulating the President on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. He brings to his role a wealth of experience at the United Nations and, as a former Foreign Minister, in international affairs generally. The ties between Australia and Nigeria date from the very inception of Nigeria's nationhood and have always been close aid productive. I look forward to close personal co-operation with him during my presence here, and to a rewarding General Assembly under his leadership.
This year we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the start of the Second World War, a war which took more lives, and visited more devastation, than any conflict in human history. The end of that war aid the beginning of the United Nations were closely linked. The founding and sustaining inspiration of this Organization has been a vision of world peace, achieved end sustained through international co-operation.
It is an appropriate time now to reflect on how that vision has fared, to look back on what has been achieved, to see what more can be achieved, and to ask what more needs to be done to maximise the United Nations role in maintaining international peace and security. So it is on these themes - on the United Nations role in peace-making, peace-keeping and disarmament - that I want to focus this Australian contribution to the general debate. It is a contribution made against the background of Australia's position as a founding Member of the United Nations, a nation which has always seen the United Nations as a means of giving small aid middle-sized countries a significant say in international issues and a nation which has, over the years, sought to make a constructive contribution to the United Nations efforts in all three areas of peace-making, peace-keeping and disarmament. 
The political will of the international community to empower the United Nations with the capacity to fulfil the role its founders envisaged has ebbed and flowed in the years since the San Francisco Conference drafted the United Nations Charter. For much of this period, as we all know too well, the cold war cast a long shadow over the work of the Organization. It worked to hamstring the operation of the Security Council, weaken the capacity of the United Nations to deal with regional conflicts, and inject an East-West dimension into virtually every area of the Organization's operations.
But now, by contrast, the thaw that has occurred in the climate of East-West relations in recent years has had a profoundly positive effect on the work of the United Nations. It has cleared the way for United Nations involvement in a record number of peace-keeping operations. It has changed the whole tone of debate in this Hall in a way that makes it easier to arrive at constructive and practical outcomes. And it has, for the first time in many years, opened the door to serious discussion about how to strengthen the peace-making and peace-keeping role of the United Nations.
The primary aim of our Organization remains the maintenance of international peace and security, and there is no doubt that the United Nations can play a hugely important role in peace-making and the avoidance and resolution of international conflict:
In so far as conflict is caused by ignorance of the factual situation or of the motives of rival Sates, or by mutual misunderstanding, the United Nations can act to bring the parties to a common appreciation of the facts and of each other's intentions.
In so far as conflict is caused by angry and emotional reaction to specific problems, the United Nations can act through discussion and delay to institute a cooling-off period until such problems can be approached through peaceful means. In so far as conflict is caused by a lack of imagination in finding original solutions to difficult bilateral problems, the United Nations as an outside party may be able to identify pacific outcomes that the parties directly aid intimately involved cannot see unaided.
In so far as conflict is caused by the ambition of individual leaders, United Nations peace-making can utilize the spotlight of global public opinion to press for more reasonable attitudes.
In so far as conflicts are perpetuated by the unwillingness of the parties to back down and make concessions to one another, United Nations peacemakers can be impartial third parties to whom concessions can more easily be made.
And in so far as conflict is created by irreconcilable national interests, the United Nations can at least interpose itself between the parties until such time as those differences do not have the sort of priority that impels nations towards armed conflict, or until longer-term solutions are found.
The Charter assigns the main responsibility for maintaining international peace and security to the Security Council. Despite its structural and procedural shortcomings the Security Council remains the lynchpin of the United Nations in terms of the Organization's peace-making and peace-keeping functions. In empowering the Secretary-General to bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which may threaten peace, the Charter's intention was not so much to have the United Nations deal with conflicts once they had broken out as to stop tensions developing into hostilities; its role was essentially preventive. From that evolved the f motion of good offices, which both the Security Council and the Secretary-General have been called upon to exercise in discharging their duties.
For many years, as we again all know, the Security Council has had at best a mixed record in discharging those functions. But the dark days, when action by the Security Council was impeded by political point-scoring or capricious use of the veto, appear to be coming to an end aid being replaced by the Council's use foe a genuine search for solutions to international problems. Certainly, we welcome the more responsive aid responsible recognition by permanent members of the need for decisive steps to make and keep the peace. But it is now timely for us to look more positively end energetically at ways in WHICH the role of the Security Council in averting threats to peace - averting, If you like, our global political environment - can best be strengthened.
Undoubtedly the greatest scope for enhancing the Council's effectiveness lies in improving Its ability to take pre-emptive international action to stop disputes developing into hostilities, for peace-making to be effective, both the Council and the Secretary-General need up-to-date, comprehensive and reliable information on which to base assessments and make recommendations. In his 1989 report on the work of the Organization, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has drawn attention to the problems encountered by the Secretariat in ensuring that it is adequately briefed and prepared to deal with incipient breaches of the peace.
Australia wholeheartedly endorses the Secretary-General’s observations. Prom the outset of the United Nations we have argued that the Secretary-General of the Organization should be encouraged to play a bold part in all the work of this body aid to take a large measure of initiative. In the Security Council In 1985 ray predecessor, Mr. Hayden, indicated Australia 's strong support for proposals that the Secretary-General be more extensively involved as mediator, arbitrator, negotiator or catalyst in seeking solutions to international problems that threaten to disturb the peace. That Is a role that was developed first by Dag Hammarskjold in the context of a period of rigid super-Power hostility. Ironically, the new era of co-operation can bring it to full fruition.
In this Improved International climate we should be willing and able to make major new efforts to Improve the flow of information to the Secretariat and the Security Council. Australia has already assisted the Secretary-General in this respect, but we consider the time has now come for more formal methods of communication. The idea that we would support, already widely canvassed, is that the Security Council should hold periodic meetings at foreign minister level, in closed session, to exchange information and views on those events and developments which could escalate into conflict. There seems to be no dissent as to the usefulness of that idea. Perhaps the first such meeting could take place immediately after this session of the General Assembly.
Despite some inherent limitations in the Secretary-General's capacity to act, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has shown through his own personal initiative and courage a determination to pursue the cause of peace. His energetic diplomacy in seeking an end to the divisions and conflicts in Cyprus and Afghanistan, for example, demonstrate the scope for the Secretary-General's good-offices role, aid we welcome this timely development. But in recognizing and respecting Mr. Perez de Cuellar's endeavours it is no less important for the General Assembly to recognize the contribution it can make to resolving disputes. 
Frustrated as we all sometimes are by repetitious debates and resolutions, we must try to imagine how much worse off the Organization would be if it lacked this representative forum, bringing together as it does not only the great Powers but the medium-sized and small States to exchange information, concerns and experience. It is in this Assembly that the nations of the world ate best able to develop, through their collective expressions of will, appropriate norms of international behaviour against which the actions of individual States might be judged.
The weight of international opinion, as reflected in our debates and resolutions, should not be underestimated. The Australian delegation to the San Francisco Conference of 1945 considered that the General Assembly should have the widest possible powers of discussion and recommendation so that the pressure of world public opinion could be brought to bear upon countries not living up to their international obligations. By the same token, Australia has consistently taken the position that the General Assembly should avoid exacerbating differences and hindering the peace-making process by manifestly provocative resolutions such as that equating Zionism with racism. The General Assembly is at its best and acting truest to the founding spirit of the United Nations when it is acting constructively, seeking solutions to problems and pointing to practical ways forward.
If I may shift the focus now from peace-making to peace-keeping, it is clear that with the renewed confidence now felt by the international community in the opportunities for collective action to keep the peace, the demands on the United Nations machinery have grown greater and have in turn created their own urgent problems for the Organization. The Secretary-General has himself drawn attention to some of the important implications for the United Nations of these both promising and challenging developments. Most recently, the United Nations experience with the peace-keeping operation in №ш1Ь1а has illustrated the consequences of paying insufficient regard to the prerequisites for efficiently carrying out the Security Council's decisions. As a result of problems in resolving funding and related logistical questions, valuable time was lost in deploying the peace-keeping forces in Namibia, and the success of that operation was potentially compromised. We should not allow such a situation to happen again. The obstacles encountered on this occasion can and must be avoided.
It is obvious that a successful United Nations peace-keeping operation requires prior agreement by consensus on its mandate, precise arrangements for its funding, and adequate prior planning for its deployment. Those pre-conditions are all the more imperative because of the expanding role being accorded peace-keeping operations and the renewed interest being shown by Member States in taking part in these exercises. If the international community is to make effective and constructive contributions to keeping the peace and forging long-term solutions to conflicts, greater resources must be put at the disposal of the Secretary-General and the Security Council.
It is essential, in the first place that we overcome the difficulties and delays associated with inadequate arrangements for the financing of peace-keeping operations. In part, their inadequacy arises from the failure of Member States in the past to pay their contributions in full and on time. The Secretary-General has mentioned in his report that one possibility for the future would be the establishment of a special reserve fund for peace-keeping, and this idea should certainly be further elaborated. In the interim, however, it would appear that an increase in the working capital fund by 3100 million would go a long way towards overcoming current problems. That, perhaps along with some form of special fund, would ensure that operations do not founder for lack of reserves at an early stage. The United Nations needs to have in place not only access to funds but also structures and machinery that can spring readily into action. It cannot afford to re-invent the peace-keeping wheel each time the Organization is called on to exert its peace-keeping mandate.
Australia stands ready to help in all those respects. We have participated in most of the United Nations peace-keeping operations, and have been a member of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations since its inception. To contribute to the Organization's capacity to respond to situations requiring peace-keeping services, we would be willing, among other things, to make available to the United Nations the services of a senior Australian army officer to join the military planning staff.
More, of course, is required than ad hoc individual arrangements of that kind. The renaissance of peace-keeping operations has resulted in a vast increase in the number of countries contributing to operations. In the last year, this number has jumped from 23 to 47, and I understand that another 47 countries are looking to participate. The reality is that the sheer number of operations under way or imminent places a large burden on the very competent members of the Secretariat responsible for co-ordinating and planning operations. Member States should acknowledge that it is now time to increase the number of personnel working on these matters, and to ensure that the Secretary-General is in a position to recruit persons of the highest calibre to the task. Australia would also support a review of the structure of the United Nations Secretariat to look at the desirability of bringing all peace-keeping activities under a single division of the Secretariat.
Peace-keeping arrangements have to be not only planned on a professional basis but also effectively implemented at the operational level. There is a very basic but still very important need to institute on a much more formal and regularized basis the training of new members of peace-keeping operations, both in the principles that underline such operations and in the procedures that must be followed.
More training seminars at the regional, national, and international levels are required. An international training centre could be set up directly under the auspices of the United Nations, if that is seen as the most economic and effective way to undertake the task. In any event, training in peace-keeping activities along lines recommended by the United Nations itself could, with advantage, become a component of the regular training given by countries to their national armies.
Equally, in order to facilitate the expeditious and most effective use of troops, Australia would support States designating military units and observers that could be called upon at short notice and undergo appropriate training in advance. To the same end, we would support the establishment of a stockpile of essential supplies, such as transport and communication equipment, that would also be readily available at short notice for new and urgent tasks to which the United Nations becomes committed.
Australia also sees value in exploring, perhaps by means of a study, the possible application of modern technology to peace-keeping operations. While aware of the complexities and sensitivities that, for example, satellite monitoring would entail, an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages would be a useful next step.
In both planning and Implementing peace-keeping operations, there is a general need, particularly with so many new personnel-contributing countries entering the arena, to tap mote systematically the experience of those countries which have played that role before. Here as elsewhere, better commutation and co-operation will help avoid wasteful repetition and duplication of effort. Consideration of all those steps will take on renewed urgency if and when the United Nations is called upon to sponsor, as Australia believes it should be, an international control mechanism as part of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia. It is a sign of the times that what is being proposed here is not a traditional peace-keeping force as such, but a mechanism for supervising, monitoring, and verifying, among other things, a cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign forces, a cessation of external arms supplies, measures of disarmament, release and exchange of prisoners of war, the holding of democratic elections, and assisting with the maintenance of law and order.
We are gratified that the United Nations Secretariat has taken particular care to prepare itself well in advance for that possible undertaking. Australia was pleased to be able to join the Secretary-General's fact-finding mission to Cambodia, in the context of the Paris Conference on Cambodia, to look at the logistical problems an international control mechanism would face. We see that both as a very useful exploratory exercise in its own right and as a helpful precedent to have created for such planning action in the future.
Peace-keeping is not and should not be an end in itself but a means for establishing the right circumstances in which to advance the cause of peace. But, as some of the more persistent international trouble-spots demonstrate, the customary processes of easing tensions and putting in place the machinery for their indefinite resolution are not sufficient to guarantee global security. What is required is a commitment not only to renouncing the use of force to settle disputes but also to working towards general and complete disarmament.
Disarmament and arms control are not matters exclusively for the great Powers. The super-Powers, for obvious reasons, bear a special responsibility to make real progress towards the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and in this respect we welcome the very encouraging outcome, covering several arms control issues, of the most recent meetings between the Soviet Union and the United States.
The rest of the international community, however, cannot afford to sit back and await agreements between the major military Powers. There is also a role for multilateral disarmament efforts that involve the middle and small Powers. Indeed, there are some arms control issues that can only be dealt with effectively through multilateral negotiations.
Foremost among them is the abolition of chemical weapons. For 20 years, concerned Governments have been labouring under United Nations auspices in Geneva to produce an international agreement banning the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, weapons which inflict untold misery and suffering on combat forces and civilians alike.
It was in order to give impetus to those negotiations that just two weeks ago Australia, which has long been active in the United Nations and elsewhere on the chemical weapons issue, hosted the Government Industry Conference against Chemical Weapons, attended by senior officials from 66 Governments together with representatives of 95 per cent of the world's chemical industry. The Paris Conference on chemical weapons in January this year demonstrated that the international community is politically committed to concluding at the earliest date a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. The significance of the recent Canberra Conference, bringing together as it did on a major scale representatives of government and industry, is that it demonstrated that political will is now accompanied by the necessary practical will - a practical will to bring the talking to a close, a practical will to put into effect, sooner rather than later, a convention that will be workable and effective in the real modern industrial world.
At Canberra, for the first time the world's chemical industry collectively signalled its unequivocal commitment to assist Governments to conclude a chemical-weapons ban. Industry also agreed to establish a formal International Industry Forum - representing chemical industries from all major blocs and sectors, not just the developed countries - to address the remaining practical issues to be resolved in the negotiation and implementation of a practical, verifiable, chemical-weapons convention.
The Canberra Conference identified a number of interim steps that could be taken prior to the conclusion of a convention - and which indeed in some countries were already being taken - steps both to build confidence in the possibility of a successful convention and to build the working arrangements that would be needed to put that convention into operation. There was general agreement at the Canberra Conference not only that 1990 would be a critical year for the negotiations, but that it should be possible to negotiate substantive outstanding issues to resolution within that time-frame.
We believe that it is a reasonable hope, and expectation, that as a result of all the developments in chemical weapons diplomacy this year, aid in particular with the momentum new generated by the Canberra Conference, the international community will get a better chemical-weapons convention, aid get it sooner than might otherwise have been the case. 
Already there have been further very positive signs that this momentum will be maintained. The statements made from this rostrum in the last week by President Bush and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, following as they did the agreement a few days earlier between the United States and the Soviet Union on the exchange of data and other confidence-building measures, were very welcome. These developments are important not only in their own right, but because they indicate that the dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union on chemical weapons is keeping pace with multilateral negotiations, that both major Powers are now firmly committed to advancing the Geneva negotiations, and that they will help ensure that those multilateral negotiations conclude successfully and soon.
Nuclear disarmament, through progressive, stabilizing reductions in the existing arsenals, remains a high priority. This is properly recognized as an imperative in its own right. But it is also closely related to another vital objective; preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. Australia remains a dedicated supporter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the single most effective and widely supported international arms control agreement in existence. We share with the overwhelming majority of United Nations Members the conviction that the world would be a very much more dangerous place without that Treaty and the standards of international behaviour it sets.
Preparations have begun for the Fourth Review Conference of the Treaty next year. Australia is actively participating with other parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in this important process, with the aim of further strengthening the Treaty to meet the proliferation challenges of the 1990s. Such challenges are emerging strongly in a number of regions. The Treaty's effectiveness would be increased by still wider membership and we appeal again to those States which have not already become parties to do so as a matter of priority. 
A ban on nuclear testing also occupies a central place in the quest for disarmament. We welcome the progress being made in the bilateral super-Power negotiations on nuclear testing and the developments on a number of fronts on the key issue of verification. What is clearly lacking  however, in the Conference on Disarmament - the body that has the relevant ability add authority - is the consensus to establish an ad hoc committee to put in place systematically the building blocks for an effectively verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty. Australia is firmly committed to the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and we shall again sponsor a draft resolution urging the member States of the Conference on Disarmament to meet their responsibilities in this regard.
Efforts at the global level ate important in securing the objectives of peace and disarmament. But constructive and balanced endeavours at the regional level can also make an important contribution. Representatives will be aware of the action that the countries of the South Pacific took in 19B5 to conclude the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which has now, just in this last year, been ratified and taken effect. That Treaty is not only consistent with the Charter of the United Nations  d the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, but gives important witness to the aspirations of a region which, while it may be remote from most of the world's present centres of conflict, is no less deeply committed to the cause of world peace.
The founders of the United Nations recognized that lasting security required more than even the prevention of wars and the reduction of armaments that true security was multidimensional in character, resting ultimately on improving the quality of life of all the peoples of the world. Our founders understood that military and economic and personal security were indivisible and that the origins of many conflicts lay in economic hardships and the denial of basic human rights. 
These issues still rightly loom very large in the work of the United Nations system, and, if anything, have increased in their international significance. 'We the peoples of the United Nations' - to quote the opening lines of the United Nations Chatter - are today bound together in many complex ways. We face common problems which can be solved only by common efforts. The United Nations, if it is to remain a relevant institution, must be closely involved in all these efforts. It has a role to play in co-ordinating, aid in some cases leading, international efforts against threats to the environment, such as the depletion of the ozone layer, and other phenomena that put our common habitat at risk. The United Nations has a role to play in encouraging dialogue and practical action on the many pressing economic problems faced by so many countries, especially those of debt, poverty, and other barriers to trade and economic growth. The world simply cannot be regarded as free from the sources of tension which lead to international conflict until the problems of poverty and gross economic inequality are overcome. The United Nations has a role to play in combating terrorism aid in the fight against drug trafficking, which today pose threats to the very fabric of some of our communities. It has a crucial role to play in the whole range of humanitarian endeavours - from promoting fundamental human rights and freedoms, to caring for refugees and eradicating life-threatening epidemics - where so much has already been achieved, but so much remains to be done.
The General Assembly will debate all those aid other matters of major international concern, demonstrating the unchanging validity and vitality of the Organization, and in so debating the issues it will have the unequivocal support of my country. Mr. Herbert V. Evatt, who was President of the third session of the General Assembly back in 1948, summed up Australia's view of the United Nations in the following memorable terms over 40 years ago. The United Nations, he said:
'... is the best presently available instrument both for avoiding the supreme end ultimate catastrophe of a third world war, waged with all-destroying weapons, and also for establishing an international order which should and can assure to mankind security against poverty, unemployment, ignorance, famine and disease'.
That vision of an active and effective United Nations was shared by all our founding forebears, and the onus on all of us now is to keep faith with that vision.

It is a great pleasure to see a distinguished leader such as Ambassador Garba presiding over this Assembly. We have come to know him well from contacts between New Zealand and Nigeria, and we are confident that the Assembly is in very good hands.
I last attended the General Assembly in 1985. I was then the Deputy Prime Minister of a recently elected Labour Government. I spoke on behalf of New Zealand in the general debate during the fortieth session. That year, of course, we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.
We all spoke with pride and enthusiasm about the Charter. We analysed its potential and looked at what had been achieved in the United Nations system over 40 years. And it was true much had been accomplished. But we all knew in our heart of hearts that despite the praise, the plaudits and the peace, it threatened to be a hollow anniversary.
The failure to make progress on nuclear disarmament had distorted the fabric of international life. Seemingly intractable conflicts proliferated in many parts of the world. The peace-keeping machinery of the United Nations lay almost dormant and apparently dismissed. In our own region, the South Pacific, we watched anxiously the process of decolonisation and self-determination in New Caledonia, where violence seemed imminent. Sadly, these fears proved well founded. In South Africa, the regime in Pretoria continued year by year its unremitting and abhorrent practice of apartheid and its illegal occupation of Namibia. In 1985 there was all too much evidence that respect for international law and the basic norms of the United Nations Charter were being ignored. We saw the International Court being treated with cynical disdain. There was a steady erosion of State willingness to accept the rule of law and compulsory jurisdiction. New Zealand itself, in 1985, had been the victim of an unlawful act of force during the Rainbow Warrior incident. I was obliged to draw that incident to the Assembly's attention in some detail.
But times have changed. Four years later I am back in New York and I find a new picture. We have turned a corner. There have been encouraging signs concerning many of the intractable problems that we faced in 1985. It is a matter of enormous satisfaction to New Zealand that the United Nations, has been a key component in these developments. Even in the darkest days of cynicism about the United Nations, New Zealand stood up and spoke out in support of the United Nations, the Charter principles and the rule of law. We applaud what has happened and what is continuing to happen. Let me cite some examples.
In the area of peace-keeping, we see the United Nations proving what can be done, with hard-won progress in the conflict between Iran and Iraq. In southern Africa, a very important step has been taken in Namibia. New Zealand is pleased to have been able to contribute personnel to United Nations forces in both those situations, and also in Afghanistan. In the Pacific, we see grounds for hope in New Caledonia. We look forward to a genuine act of self-determination in accordance with United Nations principles.
On disarmament, we have also seen a marked change in the atmosphere, in the attitudes of the two super-Powers. One major agreement has been achieved: the intermediate-nuclear-forces Treaty. Other agreements, on strategic nuclear forces and conventional forces, are being negotiated. We in New Zealand appreciate the complexities of these negotiations. We applaud what has been achieved and what is being done. But our message must continue to be put bluntly: Do not return to the snail's pace of the 1970s and early 1980s. Deep cuts in strategic weapons and conventional forces are urgent. We have a historical opportunity that may not come again for a very long time. If the momentum slows and the moment is lost, history and all humanity will judge those responsible very harshly indeed.
I also have to say quite plainly that we remain disappointed that the United Nations plays a less than central role in key disarmament negotiations. The United Nations must be a primary forum for the discussion of disarmament issues and the eventual negotiation of disarmament treaties. New Zealand, together with Australia, has a special interest in promoting, through the United Nations system, progress towards a comprehensive test ban. We again urge in the strongest terms that the powerful few reconsider our resolution with an open mind.
New Zealand has a particularly well known position on the question of nuclear weapons. I want to reiterate what I said to the Assembly in 1985:
'We have ... declared unambiguously that we do not want any country to defend New Zealand with nuclear weapons ..„ We will not have any nuclear weapons on our territory.' (A/40/PV.7, p. 66) Since 1985 this policy has attracted widespread public support in New Zealand. This support continues to grow. It is clearly reflected in public opinion polls. New Zealand is, and will remain, a nuclear-weapon-free State. Consistent with that position we urge, in the strongest terms, that nuclear testing and nuclear weapons themselves be eliminated at the earliest possible date.
Another field in which we have observed significant developments in recent years is the rule of international law. It was a matter of great encouragement to many small countries when last year, in the Assembly, President Gorbachev announced that the Soviet Union was adopting a new policy towards the International Court of Justice. We also warmly welcome the fact that the Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement, at their meeting at The Hague in July, began a constructive analysis of the Court and the role of international law. These developments went further and were reinforced by the welcome news of the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the compulsory settlement of disputes in the fields of drug trafficking and terrorism. New Zealand urges all countries to review their positions on compulsory jurisdiction and the settlement of disputes by third-party mechanisms. In this context I would also refer to the variety of roles that the Secretary-General can play to resolve disputes.
I should also like to acknowledge in this Hall the people in the United Nations system who have done so much to ensure the progress made over the past few years. I do not mean only the staff that supports meetings here and in Geneva. I remember also the unseen United Nations employees and volunteers who work in the field, often in very dangerous environments and suffering considerable hardship, negotiating cease-fires, organizing peace-keeping forces, serving in peace-keeping operations and running emergency relief and development assistance programmes. I want them to know that the people of New Zealand welcome and appreciate their very real contributions.
It would be tempting at this point to conclude that the United Nations is in good shape, that things are all headed in the right direction and that we can all go home feeling good about what we have achieved. But that is not the case. The United Nations system is still struggling with major problems. The evil of apartheid is still with us. We have not done enough to reduce poverty and indebtedness. Political solutions still elude us in the Middle East and Cambodia. But I have to tell the Assembly that, in New Zealand's assessment, a much larger
problem has crept up on the world's leaders. It has caught us unawares. The problem I refer to is the health of the planet Earth itself.
I know that the United Nations has not ignored the environment. Mr. Tolba and his staff in the United Nations Environment Programme have laboured valiantly. They have had real success on ozone depletion with the Montreal Protocol and, more recently, with the Helsinki Declaration. We in New Zealand have worked very hard indeed to support their efforts, end we shall continue to do so.
The general debate is itself demonstrating the growing international concern about the global environment. Action is under way in other parts of the United Nations system as well. A major United Nations conference on environment and development is scheduled for 1992, and it will offer a timely opportunity to take stock of the measures necessary to protect planet Earth.
New Zealand strongly endorsed the decision of the UNEP Governing Council in May this year to identify, in preparation for the 1992 conference, the eight critical global environmental problems: atmospheric degradation, fresh-water limitations, pollution of the oceans, deforestation and the others. 1 also want to acknowledge the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is proving to be a very useful and effective mechanism, and New Zealand is playing an active role in its work.
All these measures are consuming a great deal of time and energy. Environmental statements, seminars and conferences have become the political flavour of the month. But it sometimes seems that a lot of talk takes the place of action.
The 1992 conference will give us an ideal chance to prove to all the doubters and denigrators of the United Nations the real worth of the Organization. Our efforts in the coming weeks must be focused and they must be effective. We need vision, courage and action on the environment, not just talk. I want to ask some hard questions.
Politicians are sometimes accused of getting on the green bandwagon because it is politically safe, simplistic and relatively cost-free. But I want to put it to the Assembly that anyone here who believes that environment issues are a soft option is sadly misguided. The global environmental crisis is real. Human development has altered the global ecosystem in which we live. We have been taking the good out of the air, the sea and the land and putting back poison. For most of human history the impact was so slight as to barely affect the balance. But in the last 50 years humanity has wrought havoc on this Earth. We have suddenly come to the knowledge that we can affect the ecological balance very seriously. More frighteningly, we have discovered that the balance has already been changed. The question now is, have we damaged our planet beyond repair? Can we get back to equilibrium? Can we arrest the process of change? The jury, of course, is still out on these questions. If the answer is that the change is irreversible, the ultimate effects could be just as catastrophic for humanity as global nuclear war.
I saw a cartoon recently. It pictured some aliens from outer space landing on a ravaged Earth where human life had ceased. One alien says to the other, 'It's too bad. They just achieved general and complete disarmament and some hole in the ozone layer got them'.
The message I have for the United Nations system is that we must look urgently at our priorities and our institutions. We must give real priority to the problems of the environment. We must give them attention at least equal to that which we devote to the political and security issues which have mesmerized the United Nations system and Governments for so long.
Degradation of the environment is a problem that threatens out security every bit as gravely as the arms race. It affects everyone. But we must recognize that, unlike the issue of nuclear disarmament, where a few very powerful countries have control of the means of destruction, every country in the United Nations, no matter how small, contributes in some way to the threat of environmental destruction. All contribute? all suffer. Pollution recognizes no political boundaries. It is therefore beyond any doubt a problem for the United Nations.
	
Of course, not every country is equally responsible, and not every country stands to be equally or as rapidly affected. Sometimes the innocent will suffer more than the guilty. It is a fact that more than 80 per cent of the greenhouse gases are produced by a small group of economically privileged countries. It is also a fact that the contribution of the developed world to the depletion of the ozone layer is overwhelming. New Zealand understands the anxiety these facts cause to the peoples of the developing world.
We are especially conscious of the plight of the countries of the South Pacific. Last year I represented New Zealand at the South Pacific Forum meeting. We discussed climate change and the disastrous impact of possible sea-level rises. Imagine being the President or leader of an atoll country in the Pacific, such as Tuvalu or Kiribati or Tokelau, and learning that the effluent and by-products of other people's development not only threaten sustainable development in your small island country but indeed threaten to submerge every bit of land on which your people live. Small island communities in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean face similar problems. Pollution could literally wipe them off the face of the Earth.
Or imagine representing one of the countries in the South Pacific with few or no natural resources other than the fish in the ocean. You discover that foreign fishermen from outside the region have begun to use in your region a fishing technology not used there before, a technology which threatens to collapse the albacore tuna fishery which is of vital economic importance to the coastal States of the region.
I am speaking of the 'wall of death': the enormous drift-nets which in the last few years have been employed in the South Pacific by distant water fishermen. The technology is not new in itself. What is new, and what, makes it quite unacceptable, is a new technique for the use of drift-nets. This involves several vessels working in co-operation, each deploying a series of very long nets. Each net can be up to 50 kilometres in length. Each vessel sets a number of these nets in a very long line across the ocean. They sometimes cover thousands of kilometres of ocean. In the North Pacific, at the height of the season, an estimated 50,000 kilometres of drift-nets are set nightly. They then drift, literally like a wall of death. They catch and kill, like a vacuum cleaner, virtually every living creature, including some endangered species, that comes in contact with them.
The indiscriminate nature of the catch makes this an unacceptable fishing technology. Turtles, whales, dolphins, birds: all are trapped and killed. Large percentages of the catch are lost or wasted when the nets are recovered. In the North Pacific, drift-net fishing has seriously damaged valuable salmon stocks.
I have to say that this technology was rejected unanimously by the countries of the South Pacific. In July of this year at the South Pacific Forum meeting at Tarawa, South Pacific Heads of Government adopted a Declaration condemning the practice of large-scale drift-net fishing. But 'wall-of-death' fishing is not just a moral problem. It is a legal, political and economic problem, and has global implications. Freedom of the high seas cannot be invoked to protect what is in effect a systematic assault on the regional marine ecosystem. There was a time when some argued that freedom of the high seas legitimised unacceptable and illegal practices. But customary international law has responded over the years to outlaw unreasonable and repugnant practices. At the present time, international law is again responding to the unacceptable and unreasonable use of the high seas for drift-net fishing.
There is already some evidence of the international community's response to this unreasonable use of the high seas. Many Pacific island States, including New Zealand, have already taken action to outlaw the practice in their domestic regulations and in their 200-mile acres. The Declaration was vigorously supported only four weeks ago at the South Pacific Conference on Nature and Conservation of Protected Areas. It will be reinforced and codified later this year when the South Pacific countries adopt a regional convention to prevent 'wall-of-death' fishing in our region.
I want to make it clear that what is troubling the South Pacific nations is not the practice of small-scale in-shore use of drift-nets of limited size, which are used by various developing countries. Our concern is with the new and highly destructive phenomenon of very long pelagic drift-nets. The Tarawa Declaration called on the international community to support the position of the South Pacific countries on drift-netting. We have asked the Secretary-General to circulate the Tarawa Declaration as a United Nations document for the information of all delegations.
The South Pacific will be vigorously pursuing this issue bilaterally, regionally and globally. We will be proceeding in a dispassionate, rational and reasonable way. But those who engage in this ecologically irresponsible activity should be in no doubt that the techniques they use are unacceptable wherever they are used. New Zealand looks to the United Nations to support the Tarawa Declaration. Resolutions in the United Nations system to combat drift-netting are inevitable if these practices are not phased out quickly. New Zealand, in close co-operation with the South Pacific countries and other Members of the United Nations who have declared their abhorrence of the new drift-net technology, will be pursuing this issue within the United Nations system. At the present session opportunities exist under agenda items before several Committees of this Assembly.
We note that the Government of the Republic of Korea has temporarily halted drift-net fishing in the South Pacific. That is welcome. We also welcome the decision by Japan in the past few weeks to reduce its drift-net fishing fleet. This is a step in the right direction. But a cessation of this fishing technique is the only ecologically acceptable solution. Only Taiwan has yet to respond to the concerns of the Pacific countries on this matter. We urge all concerned to act quickly. Indeed, the state of our global fisheries is a good example of the broader' environmental problems that our planet is facing.
There is really only one international measure regulating fisheries that proceeds on acceptably sound ecosystem principles. That is the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine and Living Resources. In this connection, I would remind the Assembly of the important and valuable environmental protection measures that have been achieved under the Antarctic Treaty, and note that further significant steps will be sponsored by New Zealand at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Paris next week. The Antarctic Treaty is an effective institution. We are making it even more effective in the environmental field. It is an institution that should be supported by the United Nations General Assembly.
Even 20 years ago it was generally assumed that the fish in the open sea were inexhaustible. In general, anyone could go fishing without limitation. Yet we all now know that the biomass of any fishery can easily be over fished. We face a situation where the world's fishing capacity may already be close to, or in excess of, sustainable yield from the commercial fisheries in the world's oceans. We are technically capable of catching fish faster than they can breed. Fishing rights are therefore tightly regulated and licensed. Will we soon have to apply to our atmosphere regulatory principles similar to those we are now applying to out fisheries.
I have to say that, if this is the case, then the example we have set with our fisheries is a frightening one. Drift-netting is simply the latest in a long history of irresponsible fishing practices. It is just as well that humanity has not depended on fisheries alone for its survival. The record of international fisheries management is such a sorry one that, if that had been the case, whole populations would have long since perished in the wake of collapsed fisheries.
But the reality is that there is no alternative atmosphere to breathe. There is only one global climate. We must do better than the halting attempts at fisheries conservation in that respect. I have some very specific and challenging thoughts about where we go from here to deal with the problems of the global environment generally.
The intimate connection between the global environment and the global economy is beyond dispute. It does not need to be argued here. The conclusion of the Brundtland report that development only makes sense if it is sustainable has been widely recognized.

The concept of sustainable development is, in its own right, an enormous challenge for the international community. But we must add to that challenge the need to address the disturbances that have been caused to the natural ecosystems. The ozone layer is already seriously depleted. Disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes has become a global threat through dumping in the oceans. We have already witnessed unacceptable attempts to pay developing countries to accept a role as waste receivers. Acid rain and desertification threaten economic progress on several continents, reforestation is limiting the environment's capacity to heal itself and, more importantly, our atmosphere and our climate itself are threatened. Restoring the equilibrium, in all of these areas is going to involve quite significant impacts on the global economy.
I do not believe that the full extent of those impacts is yet appreciated by the general public in any of our countries. It is time that ordinary people everywhere stopped and thought for a moment. It is time to acknowledge that we are all adding to the environmental problems every day and that there are no free rides. In the end, we are all going to have to contribute to the solutions, and this will require a major change of attitude all over the world.
In this connection I want to pay tribute to the foresight shown by the Prime Ministers of the Netherlands, France and Norway, who in March this year brought together 24 Heads of government to consider the solutions. I was privileged to represent New Zealand at that meeting. We adopted the Hague Declaration. That document called for the development of some very new and important principles to protect the global environment.
What then does all this mean in practice? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its Working Groups are focusing on that issue in a great deal of detail. But it seems to me that there are two very clear messages for the future: first, if effective measures are to be taken to reduce greenhouse emissions some quite radical economic measures will be required. Secondly, as is clearly spelt out in the Hague Declaration, some major institutional changes are going; to be required. As to economic measures, these will prove particularly radical for some economic theorists in many countries, including New Zealand. As many of you will know, my Government has drastically reformed the New Zealand economy. We have eliminated subsidies, deregulated commercial activity and reversed the stultifying effects of unnecessary governmental intervention in the economy. And it has proved to be good economic medicine.
But it is abundantly clear from the evidence of environmental impacts that the definition of 'necessary governmental intervention' is going to have to change. Indeed, in New Zealand we have already begun to implement interventions co protect the global environment. The first step was the implementation of the Montreal Protocol in 1988. As a second step, I will shortly be putting before our Parliament legislation going beyond the Montreal Protocol. By 1994 we shall reduce consumption of chlorofluorocarbons to only 5 per cent of 1986 levels, and we shall phase them out altogether by the year 2000. Thirdly, to address our national policies for resource management, I have commissioned the complete overhaul of our law relating to land use, water use, minerals, pollution and hazardous substances, legislation radically reforming all these areas will be submitted to our Parliament before the end of the year. The New Zealand Government will make sustainable development the guiding principle behind decision-making in each of these areas.
But it is clear that these interventions will be insignificant by comparison with what will be required to combat the greenhouse effect. I am aware that there are still many unknowns relating to the greenhouse effect, but the evidence overwhelmingly points to the need to act.
Effective action will require measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other industrial emissions. We shall have to look at ways to encourage measures of reforestation that absorb carbon dioxide. We shall have to look at energy use, and that will have spin-off implications for economic activity and development throughout all our economies.
But there are solutions as well as problems. Radical improvements in energy efficiency and energy conservation make sense economically as well as environmentally. But these alone will not be enough. The United Nations may even need to consider the possibility that, within the limitations of present technology, if development is to be sustainable, it must be rationed - in other words, that humanity has reached the point in history where sustainable development is only possible if 'rights to pollute' are allocated according to agreed criteria. New Zealand would be the first to acknowledge that this proposition is a frightening one, and it is all the more frightening because of its potential impacts on the aspirations of the developing world for economic and social development.
New Zealand understands that we cannot solve global environmental problems unless we can work simultaneously and in a co-ordinated fashion to eradicate poverty. Sustainable development, in its true sense, will require action: to relieve debt burdens; to liberalize multilateral trade; and to promote flows of development assistance without extra conditions. The burdens of improving the global environment must be shared by us all, and they must be shared fairly. That means that some who are already at higher stages of development will have to carry the greatest part of the burden.
So clearly we are facing an immensely complex negotiating task. It involves balancing a wide range of technical, scientific and political judgements and meshing them with international economic, trade and aid policies. This is a task which requires the most delicate and co-ordinated oversight. Almost by definition it is beyond the mandate of any existing institution.
That brings me to my second major point - institutional reform. We are conscious that a number of proposals have been canvassed in recent times for institutional reform. They range from a new form of Security Council to an ad hoc institution with limited scope and a limited mandate. We are also conscious that existing machinery, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and others, must be given the room and support necessary to achieve their functions while we are discussing the institutional reforms of the future.
We accept that reform will have to be evolutionary. But a United Nations declaration on the environment may be needed, and in our view we need a vision that is clear and cogent, because if by 1992 existing institutions are not coping adequately, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will need to address squarely the key issue of institutional reform. I have no doubt the issue will not go away. It will have to be faced. In New Zealand's judgement, the traditional response of international law, developing international legal standards in small incremental steps, each of which must subsequently be ratified by all countries, is no longer appropriate to deal with the highly complex environmental problems of the future.
The time has come for something more innovative, for a conceptual leap forward in institutional terms. And we see the need for the establishment of a new organ in the United Nations system - perhaps it could be called the 'Environmental Protection Council'. The United Nations already has a Security Council. We also have an Economic and Social Council and a Trusteeship Council. We have two chapters of the United Nations Charter on the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace. We have a chapter laying down the rules and principles with respect to Non-Self-Governing Territories. I have no doubt that if the Charter were being drawn up today, there would be widespread support for including among the organs of the United Nations a body empowered to take binding decisions on global environmental issues. In our view, nothing less than an institution with this status will command the necessary respect and authority to achieve what is required.
Perhaps the most effective way to achieve this would be through the inclusion in the United Nations Charter of a new chapter dealing with the environment. Another option would be a major declaration of principle adopted by the United Nations. But we do not envisage any new body replacing UNEP. Far from it. UNEP brings together vital scientific and technical expertise. It has demonstrated both skill and ability in constructing and implementing programmes to analyse global issues and to support operational activities at the regional level. This is a vital function. Not only must it continue, but UNEP's role of developing scientific, technical and policy advice must be enhanced. UNEP may need to be built in as an integral part of the new structure. The missing institutional link, however, is the equivalent of a legislature. We would envisage the new environmental protection council becoming the point in the United Nations system which links the streams of economic and environmental advice. It would perform the function that currently falls between the cracks in the mandates of all the existing organizations. It would have responsibility for taking co-ordinated decisions on sustainable policies for global environmental protection. It would be empowered to take binding decisions. And if decisions are to be binding, the membership of the Council may need to be very wide - perhaps including all Members of the United Nations. But the key thing is that it should have power to act - not just to talk. The time is coming for a bold new step in developing the structures of the United Nations. We must show that the United Nations is ready to meet new challenges and meet them by changing itself to cope with the needs of humanity in the course of the next century.
In 1945, the present Charter was born out of the conviction that the horrors of the Second World War must never be repeated. The environmental challenge which we now face may be every bit as devastating for humanity. Let us hope that we have learned from the past and that it will prove possible to put in place effective institutions now, rather than repeat the sad experience of the League of Nations, a well-meaning but inadequate institution. If we wait for the aftermath of an ecological disaster, it may be too late.
May I conclude with a quotation from one of my predecessors, Prime Minister Peter Fraser, who in his statement at San Francisco, on 1 May 1945, at the adoption of the present Charter, had this to say:
'The failure of the League of Nations, one of the noblest conceptions in the history of mankind, was a moral failure on the part of the individual members, and was not due to any fundamental defect of the machinery of the League. [It] failed because its members would not perform what they undertook to perform. It failed because of the recession that took place in public morality ... It failed because the rule of expediency replaced that of moral principles.
'I would therefore stress that unless in the future we have the moral rectitude end determination to stand by our engagements and our principles, then ... this new organization will avail us nothing, the sufferings and the sacrifices our people have endured will avail us nothing, and the countless lives of those who have died in this struggle for security and freedom will have been sacrificed in vain.'
These words are a solemn reminder to us all that in the end it is not only a question of institutions, of conventions and protocols. It is, in the final analysis, the scourge of pollution, like the scourge of war, that can arid will destroy us unless we are willing to put principle above expediency. Strong medicine is called for a sick planet. We have no choice. And if we take no action, we will have no future.
"
195,25,1970,AUS,"100.	  It is a pleasure for me to extend to you, Mr. President, the warmest congratulations of the Australia Government and its delegation to this General Assembly on your election to the Presidency. The distinguished part you have played in the service of your country and in the development of this Organization, notably through your authoritative study of the Charter, makes you a fitting and admirable choice to preside over this session.
101.	In congratulating you I also want to express through you the thanks and appreciation of the Australian delegation for the efficient and dedicated manner in which your predecessor, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph of Liberia, discharged her responsibilities as President of the twenty-fourth session.
102.	As so many of my colleagues have said, this twenty-fifth anniversary session is an appropriate occasion to examine the workings of our Organization its successes and failures, its merits and shortcomings.
103.	looking back to 1945 we should keep in mind the a;',' nations of the founder Members of the United Nations in San Francisco and the problems they had to solve.
104.	Today, under the compulsion of circumstances and events, we must ask ourselves *o what extent the United Nations has succeeded. I 2 paramount and immediate importance, we must ask whether we can make any contribution to improving its performance. This, I emphasize, is the greatest test of statesmanship and sincerity of our times.
105.	Let us recall the conditions that existed when the Charter was signed. It was an unhappy and disturbed world in which the most destructive war of all times was still being fought; a war in which my country and many others, large and small, were still heavily involved; a war wnidi had directly or indirectly dominated people's daily lives everywhere throughout six years of struggle against violent and tyrannical oppression. It was a more disturbed world than that which had given birth a generation earlier to the League of Nations. It was a world in which there was a passionate yearning for peace and order, for a system of rules for the orderly conduct of relations between nations, for the peaceful settlement of disputes and for the improvement of the quality of life for all mankind.
106.	In this mood of hope and determination our Governments met in San Francisco. There was never much disagreement about the name to be given to the new Organization; the worldwide alliance of Powers, then within sight of final victory , had already become known as the United Nations.
107.	The forging of its Charter, on the other hand, was necessarily a more difficult process. After the traumatic experience of the Second World War the nations united in war were ready enough to recognize the need for a more broadly based and more effective institution than the League of Nations, a new institution which would have to accommodate the aspirations and interests of more than fifty nations. The major Powers had differences to reconcile amongst themselves and the rights of the smaller nations were vigorously pressed, not least of all by the Australian delegation. Thus the Charter that emerged was inevitably the product of compromise, implicit as well as explicit. This should be recognized in any evaluation of the past.
108.	The Charter was founded on the proposition that the major allied Powers, those which carried the heaviest burden of the war, would share the main responsibility for preserving the peace. If this concept was to be successful it had to be postulated on the continued existence among the major allies of the same unity of purpose that had carried them to the point of victory and on a common interest in maintaining world peace in 'he future. It was with that expectation, indeed on t! edition, that the major allies were given a special position under the Charter, with rights and obligations exceeding those of all other Members.
109.	Even before the Charter was signed, suspicion and discord had arisen amongst them. Succeeding years have seen an intensified conflict of ideologies and worldwide clashes of national interests. At times it even seemed that the objective was conflict and turmoil and not peace and security, and the promotion, rather than the suppression, of armed conflict in areas of competitive interest. Those differences of outlook, interests and ideology among the permanent members of the Security Council have prevented the Council from performing the role intended for it by the Charter.
110.	We cm speculate about what might have happened if the Military Staff Committee, so hopefully envisaged under Chapter VII of the Charter, had been allowed to take shape and to assume the functions planned for it.
111.	We might also deplore our failure to settle the question of how the costs of peacekeeping operations are to be shared equitably.
112.	Having said that, we should acknowledge that we have been spared the horrors of a third world war. Undoubtedly, the basic explanation up to the present has been the rapid development of weapon technology. Another world war has been too horrible for any nation to contemplate. No one could win. The world as a whole would be certain to suffer disastrous consequences.
113.	The United Nations may perhaps claim some small credit for providing a safety valve for public debate and a forum in which the great Powers have been forced to explain and justify their attitudes and actions. In its twenty-five years the United Nations has not been able to prevent a number of limited wars of the conventional type; nor has it found the answer to insidious threats to national integrity and security through the newly developed techniques of infiltration, subversion and insurgency.
114.	The peacekeeping record has not, however, been wholly bleak. Korea is an illustration, even without agreement among the major Powers. In the Middle East, Kashmir, the Congo and Cyprus, United Nations forces and truce supervisory teams have in the past played a significant role in critical situations which could have grown considerably worse without their presence.
115.	Despite strains, divisions and its limited record of achievement in its primary role, th^ United Nations has survived for twenty-five years. That indicates that many Members recognize that there is a residual or net value in the Organization and that they still hope for a future in which it will perform functions which measure up to their expectations.
116.	As we look to the future, it is surely no exaggeration to say that the reputation of the United Nations and the degree of respect it enjoys among people everywhere will hinge on its performance in helping to settle disputes among nations and in keeping the peace.
117.	Undoubtedly, there is room for improvement in the peacekeeping procedures of the Organization and the machinery provided for the settlement of disputes. But practical success in this peacekeeping role must depend ultimately on subjective factors the attitudes, intentions and honesty of purpose of the great Powers and of the individual nations concerned in particular disputes.
118.	Australia has consistently supported the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations with both men and money. As early as 1947 we were one of the three members of one of the first mediation and peacekeeping missions set up by the United Nations  the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. We contributed substantial forces to the United Nations action in Korea.
119.	At the present time we are making a significant contribution to peace observation and supervision in Kashmir, the Middle East and Cyprus. We will continue, as a member of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, to support efforts to formulate procedures designed to increase the effectiveness of future operations and to ensure that they are properly financed. We will continue to maintain our firm belief in the United Nations Charter and are convinced that in the faithful and devoted support of its principles lies the best hope for the future peace and progress of mankind.
120.	From peacekeeping and the peaceful settlement of disputes, let me turn to the painful and difficult problem of arms control and the reduction of armaments. The constant and frightening improvement in military technology and the complexity of the problems involved in effecting balanced armament reductions make the subject of disarmament a difficult one for most to understand. This difficulty of understanding is. no excuse for thinking it is an academic exercise divorced from the realities of daily living.
121.	All of us know that the continuing discussions and negotiations on the control and reduction of armaments, protracted, complex and technical as they are, can vitally affect the security of all countries. Security may be indivisible, but dangers to security vary in nature and degree from region to region and from country to country.
122.	The advent of the nuclear balance of terror and the knowledge of other equally horrifying weapons of mass destruction have brought home to us forcibly how vulnerable we are to the whims of scientific progress in the notoriously accident-prone hands of mankind. Surely it is right that our efforts to control armaments should concentrate in the first instance on limiting and controlling weapons of mass destruction.
123.	That said, it should be added that a worldwide balance of force, if it is to be effective in containing aggression and preserving security, must include the balance of conventional as well as nuclear armaments. It is with conventional weapons that the many acts of aggression have been committed in the years since the Charter came into force, and we must unhappily expect that there will be more. To pay less attention to the threat that is familiar and traditional than to the threat that is almost unimaginable but controllable is contrary to our mutual interests and welfare.
124.	I believe we can be a little encouraged by the progress that has been made in arms control and disarmament. First, Australia has signed the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] subject to certain understandings and interpretations. We hope it will in time become a fully effective barrier against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Secondly, indications of progress in the strategic arms limitation talks between the United States and the Soviet Union also offer some hope. Thirdly, the prospect of agreement to prevent the placing of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed is also welcome. The Australian Government hopes that the text of the draft treaty now before the Assembly  will gain widespread support. Fourthly, there are also grounds for hope that, as a result of discussion at the conference of the Committee on Disarmament at Geneva this year, we may be at or near the threshold of substantive progress towards supplementing and strengthening the prohibitions on chemical and biological weapons of war that already exist in the Geneva Protocol of 1925.
125.	I have spoken at length about the influences that affect the balance between peace and war because the paramount purpose of the United Nations must still be to preserve peace and outlaw war and because this paramount purpose has not always been well served.
126.	Let me turn now to another purpose of the Charter which can be measured by the increase in membership of the United Nations in twenty-five years. I refer to the progress from dependent status to full sovereignty and statehood of more than half of the present Members of the Organization.
127.	The circumstances in which those sections of the Charter relating to dependent Territories came to be drafted in San Francisco are worth remembering. The Covenant of the League of Nations broke new ground. It introduced and put into effect in the Mandate system the novel concept that the international community held a degree of responsibility for the guidance of colonial peoples towards self-government and independence. By 1945 that concept had been strengthened and developed by the experiences of the Second World War. self-determination for dependent Territories became the accepted goal, and was given wider and more precise expression in Chapters XI, XII and XIII of the Charter.
128.	I note here that the Australian delegation at San Francisco took a particularly active part in the drafting of those Chapters, especially those sections dealing with the rights of the peoples of dependent Territories and the obligations of the administering Powers and of the United Nations towards them.
129.	Since that time there have been profound and rapid changes, which are continuing. The Charter set the targets and the standards. It only remained for the metropolitan Powers to accept responsibility for the changes that inevitably had to be made. In most cases they were accepted willingly and generously.
130.	There was also a complementary responsibility for the dependent peoples themselves first to understand their opportunities and responsibilities and then work towards achieving them. In some cases freedom and national sovereignty came only after a lengthy and sometimes bitter struggle; in most cases they came more happily as a result of a rational acceptance of the situation by both sides and a peaceful and mutually satisfactory transfer of political power.
131.	In this process of the development of dependent peoples to nationhood the United Nations, reflecting the liberal and humanitarian instincts of mankind, and sometimes its impatience, has played a significant part.
132.	To be specific, I want to speak briefly about one dependent area of great concern to Australia, in which this process of developing is taking place rapidly. This is the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.
133.	Let me describe the position there. It is the largest of the remaining dependent Territories outside the continent of Africa; it lies immediately to the north of Australia; its area is approximately 180,000 square miles, and its population totals two and a quarter million. It is a larger unit than many Members of the United Nations. Because of its exceptionally rugged terrain and the successive waves of migration that occurred over the centuries, these two and a quarter million people are divided amongst themselves by ethnic and tribal differences and also by something like 700 different languages not different dialects, but different languages. It is this fragmented society that is now drawing together into an identifiable nation.
134.	My delegation reports each year to this Assembly about the progress made and the difficulties encountered during the preceding twelve months. The proclaimed policy is to ensure the exercise by the people of the Territory of their inalienable right to self determination. We are now doing, and will continue to do, all we can to prepare the people of the Territory for the termination of dependent status and their accession to full self-government and independence.
135.	Next year another United Nations Visiting Mission, the seventh, will go to the Territory and will be able to see for itself the striking progress that has been made since the visit of the last Mission in 1968.
136.	Earlier this year I had the honor to lead the Australian delegation to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, which recommended that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea be admitted as one of its associate members, a recommendation which has since been unanimously approved by the Economic and Social Council at its forty-ninth session [resolution 1523 (XLIX)].
137.	The Australian Government thinks that this approval and other activities, such as participation in the South Pacific Conference, are recognition of the growing national identity of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and further steps along the road towards self-determination.
138.	I should like now to range northward and westward from New Guinea into Asia. Let me say that I presume to speak about the general situation throughout Asia because of the great importance to this Organization of events there and their particular importance to Australia.
139.	In our view, to judge from the agenda of this twenty-fifth session, Asia receives less attention than it is entitled to from the General Assembly. I would like to think that this was a good sign; that a peaceful and well-ordered Asia offered few serious problems to the international community. Up to a point this may be true. In the view of my Government it is fair to say that apart from the few serious and easily identifiable major problems, there is evidence throughout eastern, southeastern and southern Asia of a measure of stability, vitality and economic progress that we would not have dared to hope for twenty- years ago.
140.	Of these major problems China is critical. We shall again be considering the question of the representation of China in the United Nations. Australia, situated at the edge of the Pacific Ocean adjacent to SouthEast Asia, is more concerned with its longterm relations with mainland China than most Members of this Organization. We see plenty of evidence to our north of how much the enormous size, power, and influence of mainland China intrude into and affect the interests and the calculations of smaller nations. My predecessors in office, when speaking to the Assembly, have emphasized that the problem of China's relations with its immediate neighbors and with the rest of the world outside Asia is much greater and more complex than the question of Communist China's admission to this Assembly.
141.	We see as clearly as anyone the need for an accommodation with the Peking regime, and we are as anxious as anyone that an accommodation be achieved. But we constantly run up against the mirror image, in its conduct of its external relations, of the ruthlessness and harshness which have been a feature of the present regime's treatment of its own people. Above all, we are conscious of the need for a settlement of the future of the people of Taiwan that takes full account of the wishes of 14 million people, more than the population of Australia and oft the majority of Member countries of the United Nations. The interests and welfare of 14 million people are not to be treated as an incidental consideration in some package deal. The Assembly has a grave responsibility to ensure that the status and the rights of these people are protected and guaranteed.
142.	It is sometimes claimed that the admission of Communist China to the United Nations will act as a catalyst in opening the way to better relations between China and that part of the international community from which Peking seems to have chosen to isolate itself. We do not at present share this optimistic view. On the other hand, we suppose that the adoption by Communist China of a more reasonable attitude towards international society as a whole, and towards the purposes and principles of the Charter, would facilitate its entry into this Organization.
143.	I turn next to the gravest problem now facing us in Asia. It is an unhappy reflection of the failure of the United Nations in its primary role of keeper of the peace that the VietNam situation has never been properly debated here, let alone considered as to possible action. Everywhere else, of course, the VietNam war has been for five years and more one of the great divisive issues of our time. It is understandable that the world's conscience should have revolted against the fearful losses and hardships that the people of VietNam have suffered almost without interruption since well before the United Nations came into being. It is less understandable, in the view of the Australian Government, that the people of South VietNam who are manifestly the victims of aggression in its most naked and ruthless form and the elected Government of South VietNam which has demonstrated beyond doubt that it reflects the wishes of the great majority of the people should have had to undergo so much biased and totally unfair criticism.
144.	The outrages they have been compelled to endure from their internal and external aggressors, acting in complete defiance of the Geneva Agreements of 1954, need to be precisely stated. Intimidation, kidnapping, extortion and assassinations have the same meaning in anyone's language, whatever devices are employed to present them under the guise of 'liberation'.
145.	The day may come we all hope it will when the people of North and South VietNam can be reunited. In the meantime there is a well-marked boundary between the north and the south. Both halves of VietNam could begin to achieve the economic stability and wellbeing of some of their neighbors if only the regime in Hanoi could be persuaded to give up its hopeless struggle and withdraw behind the demilitarized zone.
146.	The spillover of the VietNam conflict into neighboring Laos and Cambodia is well enough known to this Assembly, at least in general terms. The representatives of those countries will, I am sure, describe it in detail.
147.	Australia has been active throughout the past decade in helping the Government of Laos to maintain a stable economy and thereby to resist the familiar pressures and encroachments of an alien and unwanted ideology.
148.	More recently the same kinds of pressure have been brought to bear on Cambodia. There the North VietNamese aggression was a blatant violation of the country's neutrality and independence. In May of this year the Australian Government took part in a regional conference of Foreign Ministers held in Djakarta to consider this enlarged threat.
149.	That meeting of Foreign Ministers was a constructive initiative by the Asian countries most directly concerned to try to ensure respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia. The collective view of that meeting was subsequently communicated accurately and forcefully to the Secretary General, to the Governments of the major Powers and in a number of other capitals by three selected envoys from the group.
150.	I sincerely hope that the General Assembly will recognize this as a valuable regional initiative that is not only provided for but encouraged under Chapter VIII of the Charter.
151.	A great deal has been said, and more is bound to be said in the course of this Assembly, about the situation in the Middle East. Emotions are running high as a result of difficulties that have impeded the United States effort to restart peace talks and because of the recent series of criminal acts against civil aircraft and their passengers. The present situation is extremely delicate. In these circumstances I do not believe that any more detailed comments by me at this stage would be helpful.
152.	Let me turn to one other topic. In the last twenty- five years the world has seen tremendous progress in the physical sciences and in industrial technology. These advances in science and technology will bring great benefits to mankind. They can also produce major side effects, often of a harmful kind,
153.	An international organization like this, concerned with the maintenance of peace and security and the promotion of international economic cooperation and the raising of living standards, must concern itself continuously with these developments. In our view, the United Nations has a significant and urgent responsibility to assist in the application of science and technology to national development in the most constructive and beneficial way. Conversely, we must do all in our power to minimize the harmful effects of technological change.
154.	The United Nations has a related responsibility, equally important, to devise an acceptable framework of international law in which the development of science and technology can proceed in those spheres beyond the conventional limits of national jurisdiction. At present the pace of such development is threatening to outstrip the capacity of international lawyers to devise such a framework.
155.	It is a matter of regret that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has not been able to negotiate a convention on liability for damage caused by space objects. Australia, with most other countries, has argued strongly in favor of a convention that would provide certain, prompt and equitable compensation for the victims of space damage. This remains an area in which technology is moving dangerously far ahead of the law.
156.	Advances in science and technology have also created a need for international legal action in regard to the seas and the seabed. The problems involved are urgent, comprising both the review of old concepts and the development of new ones. The substantive decisions that must be made will be important for
Governments and their peoples and for the international community at large.
157.	Those who are responsible for taking these decisions must bear in,mind that the system or systems they devise will have to deal equitably with differing and often competing national and international interests if they are to gain widespread acceptance. The alternative to coherent multilateral action with respect to the problems of the seas and the seabed could well be an unmanageable situation.
158.	Of all the consequences of the introduction and intensive application of new developments to science and technology none has given rise to wider concern than their effects upon the human environment. Our natural surroundings are being increasingly recognized as an irreplaceable part of our heritage. The problems of pollution have arisen in their starkest form in the highly industrialized countries, and it is to be hoped that those countries where pollution of the environment has not yet reached the same crisis point will be able to profit from the lessons learned elsewhere.
159.	Australia's own situation, where the noxious byproducts of industrial development are as much a subject for debate and action as the need to develop our natural resources, puts us in a particularly good position to share with all regions of the world the fruits of cur experience in coping with man's environment. As a basis on which a contribution can be made to help solve this problem the Australian Senate recently appointed a Select Committee to report on water pollution. The report has been completed and consideration is now being given to the most appropriate method of preventing further pollution.
160.	We do not need to be reminded that this year is not only the twenty-fifth anniversary of this Organization but also the first year of the Second United Nations Development Decade. We in Australia understand how fervently the developing countries want the Second Development Decade to succeed. It is in this spirit that our representatives have participated in the various United Nations and other forums which have been discussing the preparations for the Second Development Decade over the past two years, and particularly the aid programs.
161.	Three weeks ago I made an extensive review before the Australian Parliament of our policies of assistance for the developing countries. I reaffirmed our position at last week's ministerial meeting in Tokyo of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
162.	We have long thought that the only valid test of a country's approach to development assistance is its performance and its deeply felt desire to be helpful. We believe that Australia's record of performance compares well with that of others. Our aid to developing countries increased substantially during the 1960s, and I have recently been able to inform the Australian Parliament that it will again increase significantly in the first year of the Second Development Decade. 

163.	The budget for 19701971 provides for $US 200 million of official development assistance that is, assistance under the direction or control of Government. It does not include private capital flows, which are outside our jurisdiction and competence. Mostly, this assistance will be in the form of grants carrying no burden of interest or repayment. This will be an increase of 11 per cent over the previous financial year. Of this amount, $60 million is appropriated to Asian countries an increase of 14 per cent over the previous year.
164.	I have also recently announced important new plans regarding Australia's intentions to assist, in particular, Indonesia, Cambodia and South VietMam.
165.	There is one other aspect of our aid program that I want to mention. We want to ensure flexibility in any statement of aims for the Second Development Decade that may be adopted this year by the Assembly. The reasons are clear. Conditions in the various developing countries are different and require different treatment. Donor countries also face a variety of conditions, and these must influence the commitments they can make.
166.	In the view of my Government there has been a tendency, especially here at the United Nations, to concentrate on the gross amount of aid rather than the quantity of official aid and the quality and effectiveness of economic aid. Thus there has been too much preoccupation with percentage targets and dates for reaching them. I have reaffirmed Australia's support for an aid target for donor countries of 1 per cent of gross national product, as defined by resolution 27 (II) of the second session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,  which specifically acknowledges the position of capital importing countries like Australia. It is essential, however, not to let debate about the timing and level of targets distract attention from the overall need for donors to increase the amount of their total aid and particularly their official development assistance.
167.	I conclude by returning to the present condition of the United Nations and to the faults and merits most of us see in it. Like most large institutions, it threatens to become a prey to bureaucratization. There is a growing danger of rigidity in its proceedings; it threatens to be submerged under an accumulation of paper; committees and subcommittees continue to proliferate and duplication of effort seems to increase.
168.	It is a far cry from the day when the late David Owen set up the Secretariat with a desk, a chair and no telephone. Mere survival of the hectic pressures of the three months of a General Assembly session is an achievement in itself. There is a tendency to regard every United Nations resolution as an end in itself and not as a means to an end. In all this there is much room for improvement.
169.	It is not basically the Charter that is at fault, though we in Australia would be receptive to change in the Charter if it was thought necessary. We must look elsewhere. Our distinguished SecretaryGeneral, speaking in San Francisco on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing ceremony, called eloquently on all Member States to 'give the Charter a chance', to give it a go and let it succeed.
170.	The Foreign Minister of Brazil, in his thoughtful address which opened this debate [1841st meeting], reminded us that, with all its shortcomings and frustrations, the United Nations is the only forum in which we can still opt for life, peace and development. As he said, let us use the Organization and let us apply the Charter. We should take this advice to heart.
171. Finally, and above all, we must not lose hope in the United Nations. We must not let ourselves drift into cynicism. We should remember at all times the late Dag Hammarskjold's statement:
'It is not the Soviet Union nor indeed any ether big Powers who need the United Nations for their protection; it is ail the others. In this sense the Organization is first of all their Organization.'
"
217,25,1970,NZL,"180.	 At the outset, I should like to refer to the dark shadow which the tragic and untimely death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser has cast over this Assembly and the world. In a statement made in Wellington yesterday, my Prime Minister referred to the late President as one of the most significant political figures of the post Second World War era. He was a constant source of inspiration to his people and he helped to mold and fortify a new sense of national identity and dignity.
181.	The profound sympathy of the people of New Zealand has already been conveyed to the Government and people of the United Arab Republic. To the delegation of the United Arab Republic, I should like to add my own expression of deep sympathy at the tragic loss suffered by the Egyptian and, indeed, by all the Arab peoples.
182.	President Nasser's statesmanlike acceptance of the American proposals had raised hopes that the long awaited negotiations might at last have begun. We must all hope that his generous spirit will prevail and that peace will soon come to this troubled area of the world.
183.	Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to congratulate the incoming President of this Assembly. It is a singular pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, a representative of a country which sat with New Zealand at San Francisco, on the honor of presiding over the session which takes place in this twenty-fifth anniversary year. Your career has been marked by your close association with the advancement of international law and of this Organization. It is a fitting symbol that the direction of this session should have been placed in your hands at a time when the world needs from the United Nations a strong and renewed assertion of the rule of law. I also take this opportunity to pay a well-merited compliment to your distinguished predecessor in office, Mrs. Angie BrooksRandolph of Liberia.
184.	May I also at this point say how much New Zealand looks forward to welcoming Fiji a South Pacific country with which New Zealand has many close associations to membership in the early part of this twenty-fifth session.
185.	There are many features of the world situation today which could not have been foreseen at San Francisco, even though the Charter adopted there contained a wealth of insight, and has proved to be an instrument of great flexibility. But one must ask as well whether some of our purposes in banding together in the United Nations have not been neglected to the point where confidence in the Organization is gravely diminished.
186.	Who could have foreseen that, as a backdrop to the opening of the twenty-fifth anniversary session, we should have the spectacle of international piracy, the spectacle of nations held to ransom and subjected to blackmail by those whom we treat too respectfully by using the term 'hijackers'. We must place this in conjunction with another remarkable phenomenon: the lightning rapidity with which the shock waves of events, and particularly of violent events, are felt around the world in this age of instant communication. We cannot allow the epidemic of hijacking to be condoned. It is, I suggest, time to combat the ingenuity and ruthlessness of those who use such methods to serve their own political or personal ends. Hundreds of years ago, international law was equal to the challenge posed by piracy on the high seas.
187.	Today all the nations of a technologically advanced world will need to use all their skill and determination to stamp out the scourge of piracy in the air.
188.	In a recent address the SecretaryGeneral proposed that all nations should pledge to extradite hijackers, irrespective of their nationality or political affiliation, for trial before an agreed international tribunal. My Government welcomes the boldness of the SecretaryGeneral's approach. It believes that strong measures are required. It urges all Governments to give the most serious consideration to international action which would effectively put a stop to hijacking. Important work to this end is being undertaken in the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there may well be room for this Assembly to encourage and accelerate this urgent task.
189.	The communications revolution to which I have referred is one of the reasons why in recent years vast problems of global dimensions have been perceived so much more rapidly and universally than in the past.
190.	The United Nations today is applying itself to these problems. The solutions which are found will determine for us and future generations the quality of life. They will also be a mark of the vigor and adaptability of our Organization.
191.	The relationship between population and development is one of these problems. Its solution is essentially dependent on decisions taken at the national level within the framework of the circumstances of each country, including its economic structure and its social and spiritual aspirations. But there exists also a global responsibility. The United Nations, through its Population Commission and its Population Fund, has an important role to play in focusing attention on the world problem and in providing assistance to countries which seek it.
192.	The scope for international action to conserve the human environment is even more obvious. New Zealand, as a country in an early stage of industrial development and in an isolated geographical position, does not have the acute problems experienced by more heavily industrialized and populated countries. We have had, none the less, to develop active policies in such fields as land conservation, and are conscious of the growing risks of pollution of various kinds. A national organization in the form of an Environmental Council has been set up, and New Zealand is anxious to contribute to work in this field through participation in the Stockholm conference,  in the specialized agencies and, as we hope, in the Economic and Social Council.
193.	Of equal importance and of special interest to New Zealand is the question of establishing a just and effective regime for the deep seabed. There are fewer than ten countries with a longer coastline than New Zealand. We are isolated and surrounded by a vast area of ocean. By any definition we have an exceptionally large continental shelf. In short, we have as great a stake as any other Member of the United Nations in the work of the seabed Committee. 
194.	All these questions of global scope relate to the work of the United Nations on development generally, and all Members stand to benefit from this work.
195.	We recognize and respect the fact that for the great majority of delegations the overriding preoccupation is with the mainstream of economic development. The preparations for the Second United Nations
Development Decade, to which priority has been accorded at this session, have come to be regarded as a touchstone, and attitudes to it as a test of good faith. As my Prime Minister said in this debate last year, the first Development Decade taught that sound economic development is a continuous, complex ana longterm process in which the willing cooperation of all developed and developing countries is essential. We continue to believe that it is correspondingly important that the goals or targets set should be realistic. The New Zealand Government has stated its readiness to work towards the target of one per cent of gross national product for external aid. Its ability to do so, however, is in strict relation to its ability to maintain and expand the level of its exports, consisting almost exclusively of primary commodities. This is a factor which my Government hopes will be borne in mind during consideration of international commodity arrangements for the forthcoming decade. There is nothing unique in the problems which particular countries face. It is only by approaching them together in a spirit of common aspiration that the highest factor of benefit to all can be achieved.
196.	The opportunity to pursue a common approach to international trade problems arises most obviously through regional economic groupings. The potential for development which these can present has been amply demonstrated. Caution is needed, however, to ensure that benefits accrue both within the grouping and in trade with the outside world. The net result must not be to inhibit external trade through the growth of restrictive trade practices and protectionism.
197.	For New Zealand the problem is far from theoretical. For a decade it has faced the prospect of seeing its largest market, the United Kingdom, become part of the world's most powerful regional economic grouping, the European Economic Community. In spite of our continuing efforts to find new export markets, the British market still represents the only outlet for nearly half New Zealand's total exports and almost all our exports of certain key agricultural products. Now that negotiations for British entry to the European Economic Community have begun, my Government is confident that New Zealand's position has the full sympathy and understanding of all parties concerned and that adequate safeguards to enable this trade to continue will be adopted. In a very real sense the role of regional groupings in world trade is on trial in this test case. New Zealand appreciates and fully supports the motivations behind the drive for a united Europe which could be so powerful a force for good in the world. However, it would be tragic if, as a result of enlarging the European Economic Community, one of the world's most efficient agricultural producers were driven to the wall. This would be a sad irony in a world facing grave potential shortages of food.
198.	I have devoted my remarks thus far to economic and social questions and to some of the new areas in which the United Nations is active. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that in pursuing these important questions the United Nations is achieving the primary objectives of the Charter. As my Prime
Minister suggested last year [1757th meetingJ, we are all to some extent guilty of self-delusion for as long as we fail to achieve the essential goal of international peace and stability.
199. The occasion of the commemorative session will, I hope, provide an opportunity for an analysis of some of the reasons for the Organization's inability to control international conflicts and of steps which might lead towards the diplomatic reactivation of the United Nations. This was a theme stressed by the Foreign Minister of Brazil in the traditionally eloquent intervention with which he opened our general debate [1841st meeting].
200.	In one critical area the Middle East we have followed the patient efforts of Ambassador Jarring on behalf of the United Nations. We fervently hope that the cautious expectations engendered by the United States peace initiative, and by the stated willingness of the parties to enter into negotiations, have suffered only a temporary setback. It seems to us that the minimum conditions for further progress towards a settlement are an agreed extension of the ceasefire and the resumption within that time of endeavors to bring the parties to negotiations. In these endeavors the four permanent members of the Security Council will doubtless have to play a continuing, honest and persuasive role in accordance with the principles of the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967 [242 (1967)].
201.	In relation to the VietNam war, however, the failure of the United Nations to play any real part is notorious and a matter of regret. The last four months have seen the involvement in that war, from no volition of its own, of a small country which has consistently sought to avoid such involvement. My delegation asks this Assembly today whether it will choose to remain indifferent to the situation in Cambodia, which has deeply concerned my Government.
202.	From the outset Cambodia refused to take sides in the VietNam conflict and tried to prevent the war from spilling across its borders, but in vain. Over a period of years the armed forces of North VietNam and the VietCong took advantage of Cambodia's neutrality to establish bases and supplylines within its territory. The then Head of State of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, became increasingly alarmed at that situation but was unable to persuade the North VietNamese to withdraw their forces. In March 1970 he was dismissed as Head of State by a unanimous vote of the Cambodian Parliament. The Government of General Lon Nol, which Prince Sihanouk himself had appointed, demanded the withdrawal of the communist forces, while making clear that it was prepared to negotiate on the question. Instead of taking up that offer, the communist forces immediately began to attack the forces and installations of the Government of Cambodia to make war on the country whose territory they were already making free of,
203.	That action of the North VietNamese was a clear case of aggression, of an attack on one State by the armed forces of another. It has continued right up to the present time. Indeed the communist forces have expanded their activities throughout Cambodia and have virtually annexed a large part of it. They have, it is true, used the name of the deposed Prince Sihanouk as a cover, but the forces involved in the fighting have been almost entirely VietNamese, either North VietNamese or VietCong.
204.	Some time after the communist forces had begun to attack the Cambodian Government forces, the forces of South VietNam and the United States launched a series of operations across the South VietNamese border into Cambodia. These were designed to destroy the bases from which the communist forces had so long operated with impunity against Saigon and the surrounding areas. They were welcomed by General Lon Nol and undoubtedly helped him to survive the military pressure that the North VietNamese and their supporters were putting on him. But it should be noted that the Cambodian Government had previously appealed in vain for help to the Geneva Conference coChairmen, to the members of the International Control Commission, and to this Organization. The Security Council took no effective action to deal with this clearcut case of North VietNamese aggression in Cambodia and there is no sign that it will do so.
205.	Cambodia's neighbors were more forthcoming. The Foreign Ministers of eleven Asian and Pacific countries, including New Zealand, met in Djakarta on 16 and 17 May and expressed grave concern over the situation in Cambodia. They called for an end to all hostilities there and for the withdrawal of all foreign forces. They also recommended the reactivation of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Cambodia and supported the idea of an international conference to consider the Cambodian problem. The moderation of the Djakarta Conference was widely recognized and its outcome met with the approval of many countries which were not represented at it. Yet it was condemned out of hand by North VietNam and by Communist China, and it evoked no positive response from the Soviet Union.
206.	The Djakarta Conference was a remarkable demonstration of regional solidarity. My Government attaches great importance to the development of regional cooperation in Asia and we welcome the determination of the countries in the area to find an Asian solution for an Asian problem. We are confident that the spirit of the Conference will persist in spite of the hostile reaction from some quarters.
207.	But regional cooperation is no substitute for action on a wider basis, and the fact that action is being taken regionally is not a reason for the international community to do nothing. The great Powers  and in particular the Soviet Union and Communist China bear a heavy responsibility for the continuation and extension of the conflict in IndoChina, and no settlement can be reached without their collaboration. But what is even more relevant in this Assembly is that the fate of Cambodia is a matter of concern to small nations everywhere. All of us have an interest in ensuring that a small country cannot be invaded and attacked by stronger neighbors under whatever pretext. This Assembly may not be able to do much on its own to end the conflict and restore the integrity and neutrality of Cambodia. But that is no excuse for indifference. At the very least, the Members of this Assembly should take heed of the true nature and the implications of the situation with which the people of Cambodia are confronted.
208.	There is one other related matter I would briefly add, on which this Assembly has a humanitarian duty to fulfill. I refer to the fate of those prisoners of war held by the North VietNamese. The appeals of the International Red Cross, meeting at Istanbul in September 1969, and the reiterated efforts made by the International Committee of the Red Cross have elicited no response. Yet all that is sought is that these men be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and, more specifically, that North VietNam honor the minimum undertakings which it gave in ar ceding to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. There is an inhumanity in the attitude displayed which must awaken this Assembly's deepest concern. How can it deal sincerely with an item such as that on human rights in armed conflicts without renewing at the solemn level of the General Assembly the appeals already made?
209.	Consideration of the ability of the Organization to discharge its responsibilities in the field of peace and security leads on to wider questions. How adequate is the structure of the United Nations to permit it to perform its functions in this twenty-fifth year of its existence? That is a matter which requires examination on two different levels. We are all conscious of the problems involved in proposals for the Charter review. The best must not, however, be the enemy of the good. If that wider reform should not prove possible, there is still scope for more modest and practical innovations. For that reason my delegation has joined in co sponsoring the item on the rationalization of the procedures and organization of the General Assembly.
210.	We do not approach this subject with preconceived ideas. We believe the Assembly could benefit from the recommendations which might come from a small group, rich in direct personal experience. We have in mind, for example, that the functioning of Assembly committees has become more formalized than was originally contemplated. Do they now serve their purpose in meeting as frequently as they do? There are a number of questions on which attitudes have become rigid. This, in turn, suggests that there may be a case for reviewing the agenda with a view to avoiding automatic inscription, or annual discussion, at least of those items where the outcome does not vary from one year to the next. How, on the one hand, can the Assembly's procedures be shaped to recognize the increasing practice of negotiation between, and within, groups which is now an abiding feature of the General Assembly and some other bodies? And how, on the other, can it be ensured that, in the larger forum of the General Assembly committees, countries which are not members of such specialized bodies as those dealing with outer space, disarmament, the seabed and the like, may still participate meaningfully in discussion of matters on which real negotiation tends to be restricted to an initiate circle? These are but some of the issues perhaps some of the more difficult issues which we should like to see debated.
211.	Finally, as part of a program to enable the Organization better to meet its responsibilities it is all too clear that its financial situation the precarious state of affairs with which the Organization has lived too long must be remedied. This is a matter to which our SecretaryGeneral has made pointed reference in the introduction to his annual report [A/8001/Add. 1 and Corr.l]. There is something incongruous about a world body which can stem insolvency only by borrowing. It is well to remind ourselves that the Organization is faced with a shortfall of some 190 million dollars in assessed contributions. It is surely not unreasonable to hope that those who perpetuate this situation could make a gesture in this anniversary year to help put the Organization back on a sound financial footing.
212.	The growth of the budget is a financial problem of a different order. The question must be asked whether the present rate of growth is not excessive. Growth must be accepted, but it must be carefully managed and apportioned to make the most effective use of our limited resources. In many countries, including my own, serious thought is being given to new forms of budget planning and presentation. We welcome the international studies carried out on this topic. There is much to be said for budgeting by program rather than by object of expenditure as at the present time.
213.	But technical measures of rationalization and consolidation are only part of the answer. What is needed above all is a willingness on the part of the membership as a whole to eliminate the conflict between what it wants and what it is prepared to pay. This is a basic conflict as much political as budgetary. The blame does not lie entirely with the Fifth Committee, which is largely ineffective in the face of the financial implications of substantive decisions. These decisions, often of a political nature, emanate from the legislative organs of the Assembly and the subsidiary bodies. Nor can the Secretariat, as the author of the budget document, be held solely responsible, nor indeed is inflation the sole culprit. It is we, the Member States, who hold apparently irreconcilable views about the desirable rate of growth, the level of overall expenditures and the use to which funds are put. As a consequence, no really effective budgetary control exists. This is a problem which the Secretary General himself has singled out in a plea for urgent action in his foreword to the budget estimates for 1971.
214.	While we must bear in mind the objectives of the Second Development Decade, a serious effort is needed in this year of stocktaking to reach common ground on these questions. The failure of the Committee on Conferences has illustrated an apparent absence of willingness effectively to empower an organ to exercise determined control. Surely we must deduce from this that there remains only the spirit of compromise if there is to be a healthy development of the budget, the administration of the Organization, and the programs which it services.
215.	I have dealt with some themes of current concern and with some pervasive questions of United Nations reform. All of us have, I am sure, been struck by the new strains to which international life is now subject, and with the correspondingly urgent need for our Organization both to strengthen its role in world order and to adjust itself to the times. In an address given in London some months ago our SecretaryGeneral said that:
'The news is so full of stories of conflict and violence that not enough attention is paid to the steady undercurrent of decency and commonsense in the affairs of nations, and people increasingly have the impression that in international affairs nothing ever goes right.'
216.	For New Zealand's part I urge that we all show in this anniversary year our determination to give effect to the spirit which at San Francisco gave rise to the Charter of the United Nations. Our Prime Minister then spoke of that historic conference as 'a moment of time which will not recur in our lives and which may not recur again'. Now, 25 years later, we have the opportunity and the necessity in this anniversary to take stock, and to add to the stature of the Organization. Let us use this chance."
237,68,2013,NRU,"May I first congratulate Mr. John 
Ashe on his election to the presidency at the current 
session. I am sure that his wisdom and experience will 
guide our deliberations on the many challenges that 
the world faces today. Also, allow me to commend His 
Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his excellent leadership 
during the sixty-seventh session.

The President knows better than most the unique 
combination of challenges faced by small island 
developing States. We are being battered from all sides, 
both literally and figuratively. Over the past decade, we 
have faced a flood of crises with a genesis far from our 
shores that have stretched our capacity to protect and 
improve the health and prosperity of our people.

The near collapse of the global financial system 
and spikes in food and energy prices have caused 
enormous difficulties for our small and vulnerable 
economy. A severe drought caused additional hardship 
and foreshadowed the much more difficult future we 
will face in a warming world. At the same time, the 
flow of official development assistance and climate 
financing have begun to stagnate.

Thankfully, we are presented with an unprecedented 
opportunity over the next few years to transform 
how the international system supports sustainable 
development. We will be continuing work on a number 
of important processes over the next year., They include 
the crafting of sustainable development goals and the 
post-2015 development agenda, the work of the High-
level Political Forum on Sustainable Development 
and — of particular importance to my country — the 
proceedings of the third Global Conference on the 
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing 
States. In addition, we must make rapid progress 
towards a new climate-change agreement in 2015, 
which will obviously have enormous implications for 
the sustainable development prospects of small islands. 
We must work in a coordinated fashion so that those 
processes are mutually reinforcing and deliver concrete 
results, rather than produce the usual rhetoric. It will be 
a challenge, but under the President’s skilled leadership, 
I am confident we can succeed.

However, I fear we will come up short of our 
ambitions for transformational change if we shy away 
from making fundamental reforms in the way the global 
economy works. We began a promising conversation 
on the matter back in 2008 when the financial crisis 
was still fresh in our minds, but as stock prices have 
rebounded, our attention has wandered. Let us not 
forget that most of the problems that caused the previous 
crisis have not been fixed. Those same problems also 



undermine sustainable development in many countries 
and communities around the world.

In 2009, the Commission of Experts on Reforms 
of the International Monetary and Financial System 
submitted a report (A/63/838) to this body in which it 
indicated that finance, which should be the servant of 
the economy, had been promoted to be its master. The 
rules of economic governance had been increasingly 
written to serve the interests of a shrinking few as they 
pursued risky ventures — ventures that often played 
havoc with people’s lives and livelihoods. We are 
very familiar with some of the results of that system: 
stock-market bubbles, currency bubbles and property 
bubbles. When they burst, they leave behind enormous 
hardship. Even worse, investments in risky activities of 
that type compete with more productive investments in 
basic infrastructure, renewable energy, health services 
and the like — investments that contribute to true 
sustainable development.

Our reckless inaction is demonstrated by the 
inflation of the latest bubble: the carbon bubble. At 
least two thirds of known fossil fuel reserves cannot be 
burned if we are to limit the rise in global temperatures 
to below two degrees. The cost of renewable energy has 
fallen considerably in the past decade. By any measure, 
fossil fuels are a very bad long-term investment, yet 
that has not prevented trillions of dollars in private 
investment and fossil fuel subsidies from pouring into 
new infrastructure for the exploration, extraction and 
consumption of fossil fuels.

The size of the recent housing bubble has been 
estimated at $4 trillion. The carbon bubble could be 
more than five times larger. That should be an issue of 
serious international concern. How do we allow trillions 
of dollars to flow into destructive activities while the 
most basic needs of millions go unmet? The reasons are 
complicated, but make no mistake that this is a choice. 
It is a choice made by international policymakers to 
prioritize profits over people.

As the President said earlier this week, “it is 
time for us to concede that our efforts at reforming 
and revitalizing our Organization need new impetus” 
(A/68/PV.5, p. 5). Reclaiming the global economic 
system and putting it to work for the good of the people 
will be a long and difficult process, but it may be the 
only way to reach our sustainable development goals.

The Commission’s 2009 report made many good 
recommendations for our consideration, and the first 
step must be to bring more transparency and democratic 
oversight to economic governance. The most important 
decisions are not made in universal bodies, such as the 
General Assembly, but rather far away from the small, 
the isolated and the vulnerable. Is it any surprise that 
the system has failed to meet our needs?To address that 
problem, we should start by relaunching the discussion 
on global economic governance here in the General 
Assembly, as well as by reforming the governance of 
the Bretton Woods institutions, so that they are more 
inclusive.

The systemic barriers to sustainable development 
are formidable, but that has not stopped Nauru 
from seeking practical solutions that can be readily 
implemented in the short term. An example is the 
recently completed Nauru case study on climate change 
financing. The study identified a number of steps my 
Government and our development partners can take to 
make official development assistance more effective. 
For example, project-based financing was found to be 
markedly less effective than more flexible modalities, 
such as general budgetary support.

Another key finding concerned the need for 
domestic institution-building. Accessing many sources 
of multilateral finance is, quite frankly, beyond the 
capacity of my Government, and the traditional 
strategy of conducting regional workshops has simply 
not worked. We hope to collaborate with development 
partners to design sustained programmes with a 
significant in-country component, so that there is a 
durable transfer of the skills necessary to benefit from 
international support mechanisms.

Nauru has also made its best efforts to contribute at 
the international level. We have the tremendous honour 
of presiding over the Alliance of Small Island States 
(AOSlS), a group that has been a leading advocate 
for climate action for more than two decades. The 
upcoming nineteenth session of the Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (COP-19), to be held in Warsaw, 
will be important to laying the foundation for an 
ambitious agreement in 2015. A key priority for the 
COP-19 will be jump-starting near-term mitigation 
action through the launch of a process guided by more 
technical expertise and focused on energy efficiency 
and renewable energy. AOSIS has proposed a very 
practical and collaborative approach to rapidly scale 
up the implementation of policies and the deployment 
of technologies that not only reduce greenhouse gas 



emissions but also advance domestic sustainable 
development priorities. In the view of AOSIS, that 
technical process can prepare the ground for a much 
more ambitious post-2020 agreement.

The proposal in no way relieves developed 
countries of their international obligation to take the 
lead in addressing climate change. They should be held 
accountable for fully implementing best practices to 
reduce their own emissions, while also providing the 
means for implementing adaptation and mitigation 
actions in developing countries. The AOSlS proposal 
indicates the way to accomplish those objectives. 
Establishing an international mechanism to address 
loss and damage is also a key priority for AOSlS, as is 
mobilizing climate financing and making sure the Green 
Climate Fund is ready to accept donor contributions in 
2014.

Climate change is the greatest challenge to the 
sustainable development of small islands. We must 
come to terms with the fact that, owing to our delay, 
some grave impacts are now unavoidable. Some will 
have security implications. Addressing the security 
implications of climate change remains a key priority 
for Nauru and the Pacific small island developing 
States. I would like to reiterate our proposals for 
moving forward.

First, we are calling for the appointment of a 
special representative on climate and security to help 
expand our understanding of the security dimensions 
of climate change. The special representative would 
regularly report to the General Assembly and the 
Security Council on emerging climate-related security 
threats and would facilitate regional cooperation on 
cross-border issues. Vulnerable developing countries in 
particular could benefit from a special representative 
equipped to help them evaluate their security situations 
and develop action plans to increase the resilience 
of their institutions. At some point in the future, the 
special representative could become an invaluable 
asset in preventive diplomacy efforts and post-conflict 
situations.

Secondly, we are requesting the Secretary-General 
to lead a joint task force of all the relevant organs and 
specialized agencies to immediately assess the capacity 
and resources of the United Nations system to respond 
to the anticipated security implications of climate 
change. We have heard in countless forums about the 
potentially destabilizing effects of climate change, yet 
we have only the vaguest idea of what an international 
response to those effects would look like. That needs to 
change. We must start preparing for the challenges that 
lie ahead. As the Secretary-General said at the High-
level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, 
“We must strengthen the interface between science and 
policy”. 

The world’s attention is now focused on the 
immense suffering in Syria. On behalf of the people 
of Nauru, I would like to offer my condolences to the 
millions of people whose lives have been affected by 
the Syrian conflict. We are horrified by the scale of 
human atrocity there. I am compelled to ask: Do we 
always have to wait for well over 100,000 people to 
be killed before we can find solutions to restore peace 
and security? As the President observed, the mandate 
of this body has limitations, and we cannot issue 
resolutions that bind countries. The United Nations 
invests enormous power in the hands of a tiny minority 
of five, which is not so different from global economic 
governance being dictated primarily by eight.

Nauru is always striving to improve bilateral 
relations. I would like to express my gratitude to 
Australia, which has always been an important partner.
We look forward to our continued work with the new 
Government as we continue to collaborate on joint 
projects that are delivering important benefits in my 
country.

Nauru is gratified to note that, with solid 
international support and cross-Strait rapprochement, 
the Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its 
meaningful participation in United Nations specialized 
agencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage 
the positive interaction between the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore, 
I would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan 
has made to helping my country make progress towards 
the Millennium Development Goals. We also express 
our gratitude to the Governments of New Zealand, the 
Russian Federation, Japan, the Republic of Korea and 
India; they are all invaluable partners in our joint effort 
to bring sustainable development to my island.

As the President of the General Assembly aptly 
described in his opening statement, setting the stage 
for sustainable development will require introspection, 
frank discussion and coming to terms with some hard 
truths about the nature of the challenges we face and 
the institutions we have at hand to respond. Only by 



correctly diagnosing the problems and choosing the 
appropriate tools to begin our work will we be able to 
reach satisfactory outcomes that benefit us all. 
"
263,68,2013,KIR,"I bring warm greetings from the 
people of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am privileged to 
once again address this Assembly.

I would like to take the opportunity to echo 
the sentiments conveyed by previous speakers in 
congratulating Ambassador John W. Ashe on assuming 
the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-
eighth session. We are indeed very proud to have 
a brother from the small island developing States 
presiding over this session. I am confident that under 
his able stewardship of the Assembly will continue its 
work towards improving security and quality of life 
for all members of our global community, in particular 
the most vulnerable. Let me also take this opportunity 
to express my appreciation for the leadership of his 
predecessor, Mr Vuk Jeremi..

I also commend the untiring commitment and work 
of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been an 
able navigator on this journey, steering the United 
Nations through the diverse and complex realities and 
the myriad challenges facing our peoples and nations. 
On behalf of the people of my country and our region, 
I wish to reiterate our deep gratitude for his personal 
commitment to the issue of climate change and the 
plight of the most vulnerable. Our people still remember 
with fondness the Secretary-General’s visit to Kiribati 
in 2011, which was particularly significant in that it was 
the first visit to our country and region by the head of 
the United Nations. I am also heartened and humbled 
to hear that his visit brought home to him the stark 
realities of the challenges facing our people, living as 
we are on the front line of climate change.

As we gather again in New York for this session, 
the problems are perhaps greater today than they were a 
year ago. Security challenges posed by climate change, 
conflicts, terrorism, transnational organized crime 
and other threats continue to undermine our efforts to 
achieve sustainable development, peace and security 
for our global community. In the past few weeks, we 
have seen heartbreaking events unfold here in the 
United States, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Kenya and in 
other parts of the world, giving ample evidence of the 
growing security threats to our peoples from within our 
own societies. We commiserate and join in prayer with 
the families of all those affected by those barbaric and 
terrorist acts.

The ongoing work of the United Nations, and the 
work awaiting us at this session, reflect these challenges, 
and the President has appropriately selected the theme 
“The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage” 
for our discussions this week. Kiribati welcomes the 
theme. We believe that it provides an opportunity for 
us to reflect on what we have done and achieved as 
individuals, as leaders of our countries, and together as 
a global body entrusted with making the world a more 
peaceful, secure and better place for everyone. We must 
continue to ask ourselves if what we are doing is in the 
best interests of all our people, or of just a select few. 
We must examine our efforts as leaders of this global 
family and ask ourselves if we are doing the right thing 
for our children and their children, whose future rests 
in our hands and depends on our decisions.

This is the eighth time I have had the honour to 
address this Assembly in my ten years as President, 
and on each occasion I have sought to convey the same 
message. On each occasion, I have spoken of the real 
and existential threat to my nation posed by climate 
change and sea-level rise, and I have called for urgent 
action to ensure the long-term survival of countries like 
mine. Last year (see A/67/PV.11), I said that I would 
continue to speak of the peril confronting my country 
for as long as I have breath in my body. 

Well, I am still breathing and the peril remains. 
It is a critical issue for the survival of our people and 
indeed for all of humankind. Many of us here today 
are parents, and even grandparents. I myself have 10 
grandchildren. Surely the world that we want to leave 
to our grandchildren should be better than the one we 
inherited. But we are not on course to achieve that. 
In fact, we are disastrously off course. The scientists 
tell us — as I am sure they will again reaffirm in their 
next assessment report — that calamity awaits, and not 
just for those of us on low-lying islands. What we are 
experiencing now on these low-lying atoll islands is an 
early warning of what will happen further down the 
line. No one will be spared. 

We cannot continue to abuse our planet in the 
same old way. To shape the future we want for our 
children and grandchildren, we need leadership, we 
need commitment, we need action — now. When we 
all return home to our children and grandchildren, 
we must be able to look them in the eye and tell them 
with confidence that we have done all that is humanly 
possible to combat the devastating consequences of 
climate change.

We are grateful to the General Assembly for 
acknowledging that climate change is a matter that 



warrants the attention of the Security Council. I applaud 
the commitment of our Secretary-General to that 
specific security threat and particularly welcome his 
recent announcement to convene a high-level climate 
summit at approximately this time next year. It will be 
the most significant such event since the Copenhagen 
Climate Change Conference in 2009.

But the Secretary-General cannot mobilize the 
remedy needed on his own. He will need the support of 
all nations to ensure that the action necessary to address 
climate change is taken. We must step up our national 
and collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse gas 
emissions. We must urge major greenhouse gas emitters 
to do their part. We must also call with urgency on our 
development partners to assist in our efforts to deal 
with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise 
now being experienced in our countries, and in our 
efforts to prepare our people for an uncertain future.

The delivery of international adaptation finance 
and resources is taking much too long. We cannot 
continue to stand on the sidelines and wait for others 
to deliver. In Kiribati, we are taking charge of our 
situation and moving forward with our mitigation and 
adaptation strategies. We have finalized a national 
adaptation framework and are now working directly 
with our partners on it. Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan 
and the World Bank are working with us to implement 
our national adaptation priorities.

While we are taking adaptation measures to ensure 
that Kiribati remains habitable for as long as possible, 
prudence demands that we prepare for the future of 
our people. We are looking to improve the skills of our 
people to a level where they are able to exercise the 
option of migrating, to be able to migrate with dignity.

When it comes to the Millennium Development 
Goals, our situation has not changed much since I last 
spoke before this body. We are on track on some of the 
Goals, but we continue to be off track on most. This, I 
believe, should not come as a surprise, as most of the 
limited resources we have continue to be diverted from 
equally pressing priorities to fighting the onslaught 
of the rising seas and storm surges and their impact 
on our water supplies, homes, livelihoods and public 
infrastructure. This is a costly exercise, one we cannot 
afford but that is necessary. We will continue to rely on 
the support and goodwill of our partners and members 
of our global family in that regard.

As we prepare for the Third International Conference 
on Small Island Developing States, to be held in Samoa 
in 2014, the special needs of the most vulnerable low-
lying small States, like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, 
Maldives and Tuvalu, must be highlighted, for how 
can we meaningfully discuss sustainable development 
goals when a disproportionate amount of our time and 
scarce resources are focused on ensuring the survival 
of our people?

For us, the ocean is a double-edged sword. Sea-level 
rise threatens the very survival of our people. But the 
ocean is also an integral part of our lives and provides 
daily subsistence for our people. It can and should be a 
ticket to freedom from dependency on others. We are a 
nation of water. We own substantial fishery resources. 
The annual total catch in our waters is valued at some 
$400 million. Yet as owners, we receive only 8 per cent 
of that sum. Where is the equity, where is the justice 
in this? 

We believe that this must change. Our objective must 
be to maximize the returns from those resources, and 
we have started in that direction with the establishment 
of our first fish-processing plant through a public-
private partnership. We invite our partners to join us 
in that endeavour. I am convinced that, given the right 
support, we can achieve sustainable development by 
utilizing the available resources of our vast exclusive 
economic zone. Through this approach, we can reduce 
our reliance on external assistance. I believe that if we 
are provided with the support we now need to develop 
our capacity to harvest and process our own resources, 
we will also be better able to build our climate-change 
resilience.

The ocean is the next frontier in the pursuit of 
sustainable development. While we have failed to 
protect our land and atmosphere from our human 
demands, we must make sure that the ocean does not 
meet with the same fate.

In June last year, we met in Rio de Janeiro to 
review our progress 20 years on from the 1992 Earth 
Summit. Unfortunately, our track record in delivering 
on our undertakings has not been good. In fact, in many 
respects, our environment is worse off today than it 
was 21 years ago.We renewed our commitment in Rio 
to achieving the future we want, but we need to move 
beyond commitments and to act. The future we want 
will require this Organization to restructure and realign 
itself to reflect the realities of our time: a time in which 



new and emerging security threats, such as climate 
change, climate variability, sea-level rise and ocean 
acidification, are challenging the international system 
of governance; a time in which the future survival of 
some nations is seriously in question; a time when all 
those countries with the ability to do so must contribute 
to the prevention of this calamity or be forever judged 
by history.

Business as usual can no longer be considered an 
option. Let us not limit ourselves to working within the 
boundaries of our comfort zones. Let us be inclusive 
rather than exclusive. We must listen to civil society, 
our youth and women’s groups and allow those with 
the ability to make a contribution to join in the global 
dialogue and action to address these major challenges.

In that regard, we welcome the continued resolve 
of the Secretary-General and the President of the 
General Assembly to accelerate action on the reform of 
our Organization, to ensure the highest level of global 
collaboration, accountability and decisive action, and 
to inspire a greater sense of urgency on issues of critical 
concern to our global community.

We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the 
international processes of the World Health Assembly. 
We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail in 
respect of other international institutions and processes, 
so that Taiwan, and others currently excluded, can 
participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of 
humankind.

Resolution 66/288 calls for a frank assessment of 
our global decision-making structure. It requires bold 
but rational political commitment on a global scale. 
As leaders of our global family, we must be brutally 
honest in accepting the fact that unless we act now to 
shape the future we want for our children and their 
children’s children, the prospects for success will be 
bleak. As we chart the path towards the future we want, 
we must address the fundamental threats to the security 
and very existence of the members of this family of 
nations. Once again I call on all of us to ask ourselves 
the question, “Whose interests are we pursuing? Are 
we here to secure the future of each other’s children 
or just our own?” This is the greatest moral challenge 
facing us today.
"
280,68,2013,VUT,"The 
Republic of Vanuatu is honoured to participate in 
this debate under your presidency, Sir, and we wish 
to associate ourselves with all other delegations in 
congratulating you and the members of your Bureau 
on your election to lead us through this sixty-eighth 
session of the General Assembly.

On Syria, we have seen internal conflicts transformed 
into international disputes that require solutions from 
this body. During this session, there has been intensive 
debate on the protracted conflict affecting the Syrian 
people and undermining regional and international 
peace. We join many other peace-loving nations to call 
for an end to the conflict and for the United Nations to 
do more strongly to enforce the international ban on the 
use of chemical weapons. We also urge the United States 
of America and the Russian Federation to take a strong 
leading role in the issue of Syria and in addressing the 
chemical-weapons issue there.

We are concerned at the fact that that such conflicts 
have often diverted the international focus from 
addressing much more important issues, such as our 
common aspirations for the Millennium Development 
Goals. It is unfair that countries resorting to such 
illegitimate acts can trigger wars that cost a great deal 
of money, whereas the rest of the peace-loving countries 
and their peoples suffer the consequences, as the monies 
spent could be diverted to better and effective use.

It is here, from this rostrum, that the leaders of our 
nations have spoken out freely, from their hearts, in an 
endeavour to find common solutions so as to inspire the 
community of nations committed to international peace 
and security. Our main objectives are to take collective 
decisions so as to address a spectrum of international 
issues, some of which require urgent action, such as the 
issue of climate change. It is here that we have called 
for the recognition of the rights of women, children and 
persons with disabilities who are caught up in conflicts 
and violence. It is here that we have called for help for 
those who have been discriminated against because of 
their colour, their religion or their political convictions.

For the Republic of Vanuatu, this rostrum is the 
only international platform from which, year after year 
since 1981, we have spoken out against colonialism 
and neo-imperialism in all its forms. Today once 
again, I speak on behalf of the entire population of our 
archipelago to be the voice of those who still live in 
colonized territories. 

We know that decolonization is still incomplete. 
However, we have seen the Special Political and 
Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) take 
more and more positive steps during its 2013 sessions, 
recognizing the inalienable right of French Polynesia 
to self-determination. We also applaud the work of the 
Committee in continuing discussions and dialogue on 
the question of New Caledonia. 

Allow me at this juncture to thank the Government of 
France for its cooperation in moving the decolonization 
process forward. It is important to maintain this 
dialogue with the specific goal of helping the Kanak 
people to attain their independence. With the greatest 
possible respect, I encourage all parties to ensure that 
the process of achieving freedom remains on track. We 
in the Melanesian Spearhead Group are appreciative of 
the work of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation 
Front as chair of the Group.

The Republic of Vanuatu has just emerged from 
colonialism, having achieved its political independence 
from the Powers of the British-French condominium 
33 years ago. Based on our struggle for independence, 
we share the journey and the litany of heartaches and 
dreams of many of our brothers and sisters whose rights 
to political and civil freedom are still held back by the 
tentacles of imperialism and colonialism.

I would like to reiterate today our appeal launched 
last year from this rostrum that the Secretariat should 
always remain impartial and avoid any selective 
implementation of General Assembly and Security 
Council resolutions on the rights of all people who 
desire to be free from colonialism or any form of 
imperialism.

We can debate issues of terrorism, financial and 
economic crises and climate change and reach some 
level of understanding of the seriousness of those 
challenges and the measures that must be taken to 
address them. We can talk of good governance and the 
rule of law and respect for human rights. But when it 
comes to the issue of the rights of the people of West 
Papua, our voices fall silent, even from this rostrum. 

I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, 
Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who, when he visited Asia in 
2012, emphasized that the United Nations would do 



everything possible to ensure that human rights are 
respected in West Papua, saying 

“whether you are an independent State or a non-self-
governing territory or whatever, [that] human right 
is inalienable and a fundamental principle of the 
United Nations”. 
Now, as Members of the United Nations, we must 
call for those words to be translated into action. 

My Government calls upon the United Nations to 
appoint a special representative to investigate alleged 
human rights violations in West Papua and its political 
status in the light of the controversies surrounding the 
administration established in the 1960s, the United 
Nations Temporary Executive Authority. Ever since the 
controversial Act of Free Choice, the West Papuans have 
always been consistently denied any sort of recognition 
by the United Nations. It is clear from many historical 
records that the Melanesian people of West Papua were 
the scapegoats of Cold War politics and were sacrificed 
to gratify the appetite for the natural resources that the 
country possesses. Today, they are still victims of the 
ignorance of the United Nations.

If the United Nations representative at the time, 
Mr. Fernando Ortiz-Sanz, described the West Papuan 
issue as a cancer growing on the side of the United 
Nations and that it was his job to remove it, it is very 
clear today from what we have observed that that cancer 
has never been removed, but merely concealed. One day 
it will have to be treated. We must not be afraid. The 
United Nations has made mistakes in the past. We must 
admit our mistakes and see that we are the stronger for 
that, because when we are weak, admit our mistakes 
and take corrective action, we become stronger and 
more alive. 

As Members of the United Nations, we all subscribe 
to the principles of democracy, good governance, human 
rights, accountability and the rule of law enshrined in 
the United Nations Charter. In this age of technology, 
when nothing can escape the attention of civil society 
and Governments, I ask how then can we ignore the 
hundreds of thousands of West Papuans who have been 
brutally beaten and murdered?

The people of West Papua are looking to the United 
Nations as a beacon of hope. We are now deliberating 
on the issue of Syria. In that same spirit, I would ask 
that my fellow leaders express support for West Papua. 
It is time for the United Nations to move beyond its 
limits and take action to rectify the errors of the past. 

Since our independence 33 years ago, the indigenous 
peoples of my country have remained concerned that a 
part of our maritime and cultural jurisdiction, including 
the islands of Umaepnune and Leka, situated south of 
Vanuatu, are still occupied by France. Thus, the people 
of our country are denied the right to the exercise of 
full political freedom and their inherent cultural rights. 
The indigenous peoples of the southern province of 
our country cannot, therefore, fulfil their obligations 
to protect their culture and traditions that bind them 
to the sovereign land that has been theirs since time 
immemorial.

Those two islands are of paramount importance, 
because they form the basis for the establishment of 
our unique cultural framework, which brings together 
our cultural island group known as the Tafea Islands. 
It is that cultural framework that governed us and 
defined our identity and our way of life long before 
administrative colonial Powers began to explore and 
govern our shores. 

Unfortunately, today, our indigenous peoples 
continue to be denied access to those sacred and 
cultural islands. My Government therefore calls on 
the community of nations meeting in the Assembly 
to uphold the principles of the respect of the rights of 
our indigenous peoples and their way of life. Further, 
we call upon the French Government to allow our 
indigenous people of Tafea to have access to the land 
of their forefathers, the islands Umaenupne and Leka in 
the south of the Republic of Vanuatu. 

The call by the United Nations to review the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to 
strategize a post-2015 development agenda compels 
us to rethink our global partnership structures and 
our national priorities in order to better achieve our 
goals in the period after 2015. My country has made 
some progress in achieving some of the MDG targets. 
However, the appropriate conditions for economic 
growth and development must be created. An integrated 
and balanced approach is required to deal adequately 
with the social, economic and environmental 
dimensions. 

To that end, my Government has placed emphasis on 
climate change, renewable energy and the sustainable 
use of the environment. We have now created a separate 
Ministry focusing on adaptation to climate change, 



energy and the environment so that the Government 
can address issues in that area. We would therefore 
welcome opportunities for unconditional partnerships 
in order to better address those issues. 

It is clear that there has been much debate on the 
issue of climate change. However, the level to which 
final pledges have been met has been unsatisfactory, 
considering the fast pace at which climate change is 
having an impact on small island developing States. We 
call for more urgent action and decisions on that front.

While Vanuatu supports the shift in the development 
paradigm, we also recognize that the new development 
agenda might harbour its own shortcomings and must 
therefore be given careful consideration when it comes 
to its final design. It is evident that the new approach 
must take heed of, first, the complexity that still exists 
within international aid programmes for development, 
coupled with the risk of unpredictable financial crises 
that can affect the delivery of aid; secondly, the 
challenges faced by countries at present in attaining 
the MDGs; thirdly, the ambiguities and difficulties 
involved in setting the priority of goals within an 
expanded list of priorities; fourthly, the imminent 
graduation of my country from least developed country 
status and the benefits accompanying that change; and 
fifthly, the risk of a reduced level of real aid spending 
per capita affected partly by a failure to increase global 
aid for development.

Aware of those issues, Vanuatu has taken measures, 
partly on its own and with the assistance of its partners, 
to ensure greater resilience to its own vulnerabilities. 
Our plan involves taking decisions that lead to quantum 
leaps in the development of our country’s infrastructure 
in which ports, roads and airports will be built and 
upgraded to facilitate, inter alia, the large-scale 
integration of the rural population into the national 
economy. 

I would like to thank the Governments of China, 
Australia and New Zealand and the Asian Development 
Bank for their assistance, as well as the Government 
of the United States for its enormous investment in 
the two major national highways in Vanuatu. We see 
that as an investment in the future of my country, 
where 60 per cent of the population is aged 25 years or 
under, whereby most of the rural population will gain 
greater access to markets and economic opportunities 
throughout the archipelago’s islands.

All our development initiatives must be inclusive 
and not ignore the poor and the marginalized. My 
country has taken the measures necessary to ensure 
gender equality and the empowerment of women. The 
Government’s measures include legislation amending 
laws on sexual discrimination, addressing issues of 
domestic violence and the submission of universal 
periodic reports to ensure compliance with the reporting 
framework of the Human Rights Council. 

In conclusion, I wish to thank you once again, 
Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to express 
my views in this forum. We have spoken a great deal 
about many things, and we now must translate our 
words into action. Long live our aspirations for a better 
and more secure world for everyone!
"
310,68,2013,MHL,"It is my honour to convey to 
the Assembly the warm greeting of “Yokwe” from the 
Government and people of the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands.

Every September, world leaders take to the stage 
of the General Assembly to broadcast our common 
concerns. But I am concerned that this poetic ritual too 
often hides the problem of political will. In January, the 
Secretary-General outlined two key political priorities 
for leaders: addressing climate change risks and the 



growing insecurity within Syria. As autumn sets in, it 
is evident that efforts are falling short. 

This year, leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum 
expressed strong concern about the use of chemical 
weapons by the Syrian Government and called for 
leadership on the part of the members of the Security 
Council to resolve that threat. While I am optimistic 
about recent diplomatic developments, the common 
international voice may come too little and too late for 
what could have already been prevented. That is only 
one example of a growing list of the tragic human costs 
of inaction. How many more mistakes will the world 
make in distant conference rooms? For how long can we 
turn a blind eye to realities and headlines?

Pacific nations are now dedicated to changing 
the pace. This month, Pacific Islands Forum leaders 
adopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership. 
Although many of our States are small, the common 
responsibility to act falls on all Governments and 
persons, no matter how different we are. 

The Marshall Islands is well on track to achieve 
the complete solarization of our outer islands — a goal 
we are meeting with assistance from Japan’s Pacific 
Environment Community funds and from the European 
Union, Taiwan, Italy, France and other donor partners. 
The entire region is also aggressively cutting its 
emissions through the Pacific New Energy Drive. The 
message to our partners, the world’s largest emitters, is 
clear. If we can do it, they can too. Climate change is 
a risk that demands direct political ownership, and it is 
high time that other leaders stand alongside the Pacific 
in showing the statesmanship so urgently needed. 
Simply repeating well-worn negotiation slogans has not 
got the world anywhere. It is time for new solutions. I 
strongly urge my fellow leaders to engage eye to eye 
at the Secretary-General’s climate summit next year. 
Never has the need for true statesmanship been as dire.

Global efforts on climate change are falling short, 
and low-lying island nations, such as mine, are already 
paying the earliest costs of what is fast becoming a 
global crisis. In every sense, the world must build for 
future risks, and we are still setting course based on 
current conditions, as is often the case. It is the seas 
that are rising — not the islands that are sinking. I will 
not concede my own land or my nation; nor will I rest 
until my fellow world leaders have signed on to act, not 
just out of economic convenience, but out of a common 
responsibility of all to strive for upward momentum.

Our Pacific legacy is not as small island States, 
but as large ocean nations. We are stewards of what 
is a truly global resource — our oceans and fisheries. 
Even a casual glance at a map reveals a world of deep 
and vast blue, and not only scientists but our own local 
communities see change in our waters. Local and global 
ocean impacts affect not only every region, but also 
global food security. I join with other Pacific leaders in 
urging dedicated treatment of the oceans as a post-2015 
United Nations sustainable development goal.

Pacific nations, including the States parties to the 
Nauru Agreement, are leading the world in changing 
fishing practice. We are not only leading the world in 
advancing sustainable fisheries, but at the same time 
boosting our own economic growth. Perhaps no other 
effort or region is such a strong textbook example of 
sustainable development in action. But for all of the 
expressed plenary sympathies and common international 
responsibility, existing legal commitments to safeguard 
fisheries all too often fall victim to the short-term 
trade interests of our partners. We Pacific leaders 
will sacrifice neither our resources nor our growth or 
livelihood for quick returns; our future generations are 
not for sale. The threat of harmful fisheries sanctions 
from distant fishing nations — perhaps as punishment 
for our conservation efforts — is hardly a helping hand 
either to our regional development or to international 
food security.

Next year’s international meeting on small island 
States and development partnerships, to be held in 
Samoa, will offer our political partners a moment for 
careful reflection. Is the global thirst for rare earth 
minerals beneath our waves and is the hunger for 
our vast fisheries so great as to outstrip our rightful 
economic development and our conservation efforts? 
Perhaps it is high time that island leaders set forward 
our island vision of partnership and collaborate 
accordingly. We cannot forge progress through political 
will alone. Here, Pacific Islands Forum leaders have 
forged a ground-breaking mutual dialogue to enhance 
and improve effective United Nations partnerships in 
our region. Those are not isolated words; already, the 
United Nations, together with our bilateral partners, is 
playing a valuable role in working with the Marshall 
Islands to recover from a climate-driven drought and 
other coastal flooding emergencies.

But we need not wait for disasters. In every sector 
of basic development and environmental efforts, our 
door is open for increased collaboration among the 



United Nations, our regional resources and bilateral 
partners. The statements of sympathy in the plenary are 
all too often not translated into effective, island-tailored 
results. Our in-country United Nations presence still 
has a long way to go in truly delivering as one and 
better addressing pressing threats. I encourage a direct 
discussion between the United Nations and our region 
on practical efforts to enhance in-country effectiveness 
and collaboration. No one people or nation should be 
passed over.

Even as the United Nations enters into a new 
discussion in setting the stage for the post-2015 
development agenda, improved progress towards the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains 
no less a priority. I would also like to recognize the 
contributions that Taiwan has made in helping my 
country in efforts to achieve the MDGs.

Pacific Islands Forum leaders have, for the first 
time, recognized the role of the United Nations in 
authorizing nuclear-weapon testing during the Cold 
War and welcomed the recommendations of the 
United Nations Special Rapporteur’s recent report 
(A/HRC/21/48/Add.1). Nuclear testing in the Marshall 
Islands is no mere historical event, but an international 
legacy that will stay with us for generations. While the 
bulk of the unmet responsibilities still rest with our 
historical Administering Power, the United States, the 
United Nations can, for its part, no longer ignore its 
own role during the Trusteeship era. 

I am strongly encouraged by the Secretary-
General’s commitment to addressing the ongoing 
impacts of nuclear testing in the Pacific and look 
forward to practical steps in that regard.

My Government is gratified to note 
that — with solid international support and cross-
strait cooperation — the Republic of China on Taiwan 
has increased its meaningful participation in United 
Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will 
continue to encourage positive interaction between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena.

Too often, despite our own aspirations, we struggle 
to move inches when urgency demands miles. We wish 
to inform the Secretary-General that our political will 
stands ready and that our hands are extended for a 
durable partnership.
"
318,68,2013,NZL,"Greetings! Let me begin 
by congratulating President Ashe on his election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly. He is taking the 
reins at an important time. We wish him every success, 
and he has New Zealand’s support.

The recent events in Kenya, Iraq and Pakistan show 
how troubled the world can be. We commiserate with 
the Governments and peoples of those countries and 
extend our deepest sympathies to those who lost family 
and friends in those tragic incidents.

For most of us, born after the Second World War, the 
United Nations has been at the centre of our conception 
of how the world organizes itself. But the reality of the 
United Nations can be quite challenging. It is the one 
place where the countries of the world meet, talk and 
try to find solutions to global and regional issues.

Sadly, some of those discussions can become so 
arcane that they are sometimes quite removed from the 
issues they claim to be addressing. That is a concern in 
particular for small States, to which the Organization is 
so vitally important. 

Even more sadly, the United Nations has too often 
failed to provide solutions to the problems the world 
expects it to resolve. The gap between aspiration and 
delivery is all too apparent, as the situation in Syria 
has again so brutally reminded us. But any failures of 
this institution are less failures of the Organization 
than they are failures on our part, as its Member States, 
and on the part of those who have the responsibility of 
leading those States.

There would be no dreadful humanitarian situation 
in Syria if Syria’s leaders had upheld the commitments 
made to the international community and to the Syrian 
people when Syria joined the Organization and ratified 
the human rights covenants.

The Organization would not also have been a 
powerless bystander to the Syrian tragedy for over 
two years if the lack of agreement among the Security 
Council’s permanent members had not shielded the 
Al-Assad regime, thereby reconfirming the fears of 
New Zealand and others that had opposed the veto at 
the original San Francisco Conference, in 1945.

New Zealand is pleased that the Security Council 
has at last met on the situation in Syria. The Secretary-
General has advised the Council and the General 
Assembly that the United Nations Mission has now 
confirmed, unequivocally and objectively, that 
chemical weapons have been used in Syria. The report 
(see A/67/997) found clear and convincing evidence 
that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve 
agent Sarin were used on 21 August.

The information in the report also makes it very 
clear that those rockets must have been fired by the 
Syrian regime. As the Secretary-General has said, these 
are war crimes, and those responsible must be brought 
to account.

Those that try to cast doubt on the report’s 
conclusions make themselves look foolish and do a 
disservice to the United Nations.

It is imperative now that the Council act. It must 
adopt a resolution that responds to the use of chemical 
weapons. It must find a means to hold those responsible 
to account and establish an effective mechanism 
for the destruction of those weapons in line with the 
proposal developed by the United States and Russia. 
The resolution must also provide for the protection of 
the civilian population. 

While Syria necessarily commands our attention, 
I also want to spend some time on some more positive 
developments for both the Organization and its Member 
States. I want to begin with my own country, New 
Zealand, whose emergence as a fully independent State 
has proceeded in parallel with the development of the 
United Nations.



New Zealand was present at the founding in San 
Francisco. We take pride in the fact that we were able 
to influence the drafting of the Charter, particularly the 
section on the Trusteeship Council, which paved the 
way for a number of States to become full Members of 
the Organization.

New Zealand has come a long way since the Charter 
was adopted. Then, we were emerging from our status 
as a dominion of the United Kingdom. Today we proudly 
assert ourselves as a small but independent and diverse 
country that has a wide network of friends and trading 
relationships in all the major regions and markets of 
the world. We value our traditional relationships with 
Australia and the Pacific, and in Europe and North 
America as we build new links with partners in Asia, 
the rest of the Americas and the Caribbean, and Africa.

Building and sustaining political and commercial 
links across the regions of the world is no small matter 
for a country like New Zealand. We are surrounded by 
the Pacific Ocean and located over three hours’ flying 
time from our nearest neighbour, Australia, in one of 
the least populated parts of the world. We share with 
our Pacific island neighbours the challenges of distance 
and isolation, and of having to hold our own against 
much larger countries whose economies of scale 
and proximity to markets give them a considerable 
competitive advantage. These factors have reinforced 
New Zealand’s approach to the United Nations and to 
the other international organizations that have shaped 
the post-Second World War environment.

We have a strong preference for a rules-based, 
multilateralist approach, whether in the United 
Nations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the 
World Bank. We know that rules and standards set 
internationally provide us the greatest certainty and 
the greatest protection. We draw strength from global 
agreements and from the collective commitment they 
represent.

That is why we attach such importance to the 
completion of the Doha Round. While New Zealand 
continues to actively negotiate bilateral and regional 
trade agreements, we acknowledge that free trade 
agreements often leave least developed countries on the 
sidelines. The benefit of the WTO, as with the United 
Nations, is that the rules negotiated there apply across 
the globe, irrespective of a country’s size or wealth.

Our preference for international rules reflects New 
Zealand’s national approach to governance. We have 
a robust and transparent system of Government and 
sound financial institutions that have helped us ride out 
the worst effects of the global financial crisis. That was 
despite the significant economic and social challenges 
we faced after the destructive earthquake that struck 
Christchurch, our second largest city, in 2011.

As we work to restore the built environment in 
Christchurch, New Zealanders are also conscious 
of our dependence on and our responsibility towards 
the natural environment. In policy terms, climate 
change has been a challenge for New Zealand and 
for the international community more broadly, but 
New Zealanders know we must play our part, and we 
have taken action. We have introduced an extensive 
emissions-trading scheme. We are investing in the 
Global Research Alliance to find new ways to manage 
agricultural greenhouse gases, and we have committed 
to reducing emissions to 5 per cent below 1990 levels 
by 2020.

We made that commitment under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
rather than the Kyoto Protocol. We did that because, 
while the Kyoto Protocol once seemed to provide a path 
forward, things have changed. The Protocol now covers 
only a small percentage of global emissions. We need a 
single legal framework that commits all major emitters. 

While climate change is an important issue, it pales 
in comparison to the problems faced by many Member 
States. One of the most intractable is that of Israel and 
Palestine. As long as that problem is left unresolved, 
there can be no assured peace in the Middle East and no 
security for the wider region. There can be no resolution 
without the Israeli and Palestinian peoples both being 
assured of viable homelands within secure borders. 
New Zealand pays tribute to the tenacity of United 
States Secretary of State Kerry and to the courage of 
President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu in 
agreeing to resume the Middle East peace process.

In our own region, we have celebrated the successful 
conclusion of the United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste 
and the transition of the Regional Assistance Mission 
to the Solomon Islands from a military to a police-led 
operation. We look forward with intense interest and 
cautious hope to the reinstatement of democracy in 
Fiji. We acknowledge the positive developments there, 
including with regard to election preparations and voter 
registration. The countries of the Pacific, including 
New Zealand, want and need Fiji to be successful, 
democratic and well-governed.


Earlier this year, New Zealand withdrew the bulk 
of its forces from Afghanistan, following the closure of 
the New Zealand-led provincial reconstruction team in 
Bamian province, which provided security and helped 
bring about a significant improvement in governance 
and development. Schools and hospitals were rebuilt and 
health centres re-opened. Mortality rates for children 
under 5 were halved. Maternal deaths are now a quarter 
of the Taliban-era levels. Girls now make up half the 
number of primary-school-age children. New Zealand 
expertise also helped substantially improve agricultural 
yields through the implementation of modern farming 
techniques. We are building the largest solar energy 
system in Afghanistan, which will bring a renewable 
source of electricity to much of Bamian township. That 
was a big commitment by a small country situated far 
away. It also came at a considerable cost: 10 of our 
servicemen and women lost their lives while on duty 
there. Even so, we are proud of what we achieved in 
partnership with the people of Bamian and hope that 
those gains can be sustained in the years ahead.

In Africa we see a continent where many countries 
have faced real challenges. However, as the President of 
Nigeria reminded us earlier this week (see A/68/PV.5), 
the new story of Africa is the growing number of 
countries in the region that are enjoying the benefits 
of good governance, sound economic growth and 
development, driving positive change throughout the 
continent. All of that is good news for Africa and for 
the world. New Zealand will do what it can to help 
with targeted assistance in areas where we have real 
expertise to offer, namely, in the fields of agriculture, 
renewable energy and good governance. New Zealand 
also recognizes and supports the critical roles of the 
African Union and Africa’s subregional bodies in 
ensuring Africa’s security and future prosperity.

New Zealand recognizes the importance to Africa, 
the Caribbean and our own region of the Arms Trade 
Treaty, adopted in April and signed by New Zealand 
and many others on 3 June The Treaty should curb the 
flows of small arms and other weapons, especially to 
conflict regions, and help arrest the deaths and human 
misery that they cause.

I want to also applaud the progress made in 
implementing the Millennium Development Goals, 
while at the same time acknowledging the fact that 
much work remains to be done. We now need to work 
together on a post-2015 development agenda focused on 
creating economic opportunities and the eradication of 
poverty.

Many of the same issues will be addressed at 
the Third International Conference on Small Island 
Developing States, which Samoa is to host in 2014. 
New Zealand is pleased to be a major supporter of that 
important United Nations effort and, with the rest of 
the Pacific, looks forward to welcoming the world to 
our region.

We need to remind ourselves that sound governance 
arrangements and transparency of process are also 
vital virtues for international organizations, including 
the United Nations. By any objective assessment, the 
Organization has not been equipped with the structures 
and rules it needs to operate as it should. Yet there has 
been deep resistance to efforts to make things better. 
That needs to change. The rationale for United Nations 
reform is clear. Membership has quadrupled since 1945, 
yet over the same period its key organs — particularly 
the Security Council — have become hostage to their 
own traditions and to the interests of the most powerful. 

From the 1950s to the 1990s, we could blame the 
Cold War when the Security Council did not act. That 
does not wash today. The problems are more systemic 
and relate both to the composition and the formal and 
informal processes of the Council. We now seem to have 
a practice whereby the permanent members not only 
can block Council actions through the use of the veto, 
but also appear to have privileged access to information 
and can stop the Council from meeting if it does not 
suit their collective purposes. Such behaviour damages 
the reputation and credibility of the wider Organization 
and must be challenged. Such issues are not necessarily 
matters of Charter reform, which we know is difficult, 
but have to do with the effective functioning of the 
Organization — an issue in which we all have a stake.

New Zealand is not advocating revolution, but we 
are asserting that the Council can and must do better in 
the way it conducts its business. That is the approach 
New Zealand will bring to the Security Council if we 
are elected next October. If successful, it will be 21 
years since New Zealand last served on the Council — a 
long time ago, but not so long that we have forgotten the 
lessons learned during our last term. At the top of that 
list is the imperative that members have to be engaged; 
they must listen to the concerns of others and have a 
view and a voice if they are to be relevant. There is 
no point in joining the Council simply to make up the 



numbers. Sometimes there is a need to speak up and 
shine a light on what is going on, or not going on, even 
when that may be inconvenient to others. That applies 
whether the issue was Rwanda, Somalia, Yemen or 
Yugoslavia in 1993-94, or is the Democratic Republic 
of Congo, the Sudan or Syria in 2013 to 2014.

My hope is that when Member States make their 
decision on whom to vote for in October 2014, they will 
look at New Zealand’s record and know that we will be 
a credible, positive influence on the Security Council 
and a voice for the interests of the wider Organization.
"
356,68,2013,AUS,"As a freshly minted Foreign 
Minister, I am delighted to take part in this general 
debate. Only a few weeks ago, Australia held national 
elections and chose a new Government. Only nine 
days ago, I was sworn in as Australia’s thirty-eighth 
Minister for Foreign Affairs. A change of Government 
is a significant national decision. It has happened only 
seven times in our country since the Second World War.

Australia is an open, liberal democracy. We 
recognize our good fortune in having an unbroken 
record of peaceful democratic transition stretching 
back to 1901. The United Nations offers that same ideal 
of peace and order in relations among States. It gives us 
a place to resolve our differences and to be heard on the 
concerns that matter most.

There is an intrinsic connection between the 
security and stability of Governments and economic 
development. Good Governments understand that 
providing a secure and stable environment for their 
citizens is their most fundamental task, but that task 
is tied inextricably to the strength of their economy. 
Economic growth, development and trade are the key 
drivers of national and international prosperity, and a 
vital support for global security. That is why the new 
Australian Government will put economic diplomacy 
at the centre of our foreign policy.

We will promote responsible economic governance 
and open trading systems that support export-oriented 
economies. We recognize that a strong business sector, 
open trading rules and liberal foreign investment policies 
can foster economic growth and, with it, opportunities 
to achieve prosperity and security. Strong economies 
give nations and their people an environment in which 
to build their lives — to make choices for the lives they 
want to lead. Strong, open economies foster sustainable 
growth. We understand that from our experience in 
Australia and in our region.

Australia’s economic success and high standards 
of living are anchored in reform efforts over many 
years. We liberalized our economy and unilaterally 
dismantled trade barriers and protectionist policies. In 
our own region, as economies have opened, standards of 
living have improved. We have witnessed the enormous 
growth of the middle class in South-East Asia. Estimates 
suggest that approximately 145 million people will be 
considered middle-class in 2015, up from 95 million in 
2010. In Asia more broadly, we expect a middle class 
of over 3 billion people by 2030. Indonesia, currently 
the world’s sixteenth-largest economy, is on track to be 
the world’s seventh-largest economy by 2030. China 
and India are projected to become the largest and third 
-largest economies by 2030. Over 290 million people in 
China were lifted out of poverty in the decade between 
1999 and 2009.

The Secretary-General has rightly focused our 
attention this week on the needs of the poor, the 
commitment we made to them over a decade ago, and 
our vision for the future. We need to finish the job on 
the Millennium Development Goals. Beyond 2015, we 
must prioritize sustainable economic growth in the 
global development framework. We must provide the 
opportunity for all people, including people with a 
disability, to lead healthy and productive lives, leaving 
no one behind. We must support women’s economic 
participation and empowerment.

The future of peace will be built on economic 
prosperity. Aid is an important part of delivering 
sustainable economic growth around the world. It 
plays a significant role in supporting economic reforms 
and good governance, promoting the rule of law and 
building the productive capacity of trade-related 
sectors. But it is the effectiveness of aid delivery that 
matters. For example, infrastructure deficiencies that 
prevent developing economies from fully engaging in 
the global markets need to be overcome. Estimates of 
infrastructure financing needs, including for the roads 
and ports required to facilitate trade, dwarf global 
aid. According to the Asian Development Bank, Asia 
alone will require $750 billion annually over the next 
decade to meet its infrastructure needs. This compares 
to annual global aid flows of $130 billion. Only the 
private sector has the capacity to mobilize the financing 
necessary for such massive infrastructure investments.



There is a role for aid in helping to overcome the 
obstacles to investment. It must attract, but should 
never replace, private-sector capital. The returns are 
high. A joint report of the World Trade Organization 
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development estimates that every dollar invested in 
aid-for-trade can lift exports from developing countries 
by $8.

We firmly believe that the economic growth of 
developing countries can be unlocked through trade. 
Australia will continue to promote trade liberalization 
through the World Trade Organization, through 
regional and sector-specific deals, and through bilateral 
free trade negotiations. The Australian Government 
aims to build a network of bilateral and regional 
free-trade agreements. We will work in the World 
Trade Organization to rebuild the multilateral trading 
agenda. Australia puts the highest priority on global 
economic reform and trade liberalization as the best 
way to secure jobs and economic growth. These will be 
key themes for us as we chair the Group of 20 in 2014.

No one should pretend that the economic sphere 
exists in isolation from other parts of our human 
experience. Economic progress alone is not sufficient. 
We need to ensure that all people around the world are 
free to fully exercise their economic, civil and political 
rights. Australia was one of eight nations involved in 
drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
and in 1948 the Australian President of the General 
Assembly, our Foreign Minister Mr. H. V. Evatt, 
oversaw the adoption of the Declaration (see A/PV.183).

Since then, Australia has been at the forefront of 
defending human rights globally and regionally in support 
of equality and fundamental freedoms — freedom 
from discrimination; freedom from slavery, torture, 
arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; freedom of speech, 
conscience and religion; freedom to work, to enjoy 
health and education and to participate in the life of 
the community. Importantly, these freedoms must 
extend to all women and girls, including through equal 
access to employment, resources, education and health 
services, and they must be underpinned by robust and 
independent legal systems to enforce economic, social 
and political rights.

Australia will continue to promote and protect 
human rights standards around the world. That is 
why we are seeking membership of the Human Rights 
Council for the 2018-2020 term.

The situation in Syria is an urgent security and 
humanitarian crisis we must address. Left unchecked, 
it will continue to cause great human suffering and 
further destabilize the region. Along with the rest of the 
world, Australia has condemned the horrific chemical 
weapons attack on 21 August, as we have condemned 
the Al-Assad regime’s use of conventional weapons 
against its own people.

The first obligation of any Government is to protect 
its own citizens. In 2005, leaders of all States Members 
of the United Nations signed on to this principle in the 
World Summit Outcome on the responsibility to protect 
(resolution 60/1). Australia, as current President of the 
Security Council, will therefore co-sponsor a draft 
resolution before the Council that condemns in the 
strongest terms any use of chemical weapons. The draft 
resolution will make clear, for the first time, that the use 
of chemical weapons is a threat to international peace 
and security, and in doing so set a new international 
norm that will help to deter future use. It will say that 
those responsible for using such weapons must be 
brought to justice — a call we strongly endorse.

We welcome the fact that draft resolution sets 
out in no uncertain terms that the Al-Assad regime 
must comply fully with the requirement to destroy its 
chemical weapons. The Organization for the Prohibition 
of Chemical Weapons now needs strong international 
support for its role in the destruction of Syria’s chemical 
weapons.

Australia will also continue to press for the Council 
to take action to assist the humanitarian effort in Syria 
and, of course, provide our full backing to efforts to 
find a political solution in accordance with the Geneva 
communiqué (S/2012/523, annex) that leads to a 
cessation of violence and a political transition which 
meets the aspirations of all Syrians.

But we cannot just focus on a single instance of 
global security, for we are engaged on security challenges 
around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Through our Security Council membership, we draw on 
lessons learned from our experience in peacekeeping 
and peacebuilding and take forward initiatives that 
are meaningful to our region. We welcome the strong 
support which the Security Council gave yesterday to 
Australia’s resolution 2117 (2013) on small arms and 
light weapons. These weapons are a major driver of 
many conflicts that are brought to the attention of the 
Council.



When Australia led the Regional Assistance 
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) 13 years 
ago with our friends from New Zealand, Papua New 
Guinea and other countries of the Pacific, one of the 
first tasks the Mission faced was to restore peace and 
security. RAMSI moved quickly to secure the surrender 
of firearms — an early and decisive action that 
underpinned the peace that was built and maintained 
over the next 10 years. And women played a crucial 
part.

That is why, throughout the Pacific, we are 
supporting efforts to strengthen women’s participation 
in policing, through recruitment, retention, training 
and mentoring support. In the Philippines, Australia 
is funding women’s participation in peace processes 
that bring together Muslim, Christian and indigenous 
women. And we continue to build on our record on 
security, disarmament and peacekeeping. As co-author 
of the draft resolution, we worked to secure the adoption 
of the world’s first Arms Trade Treaty (resolution 
67/234 B), which has now been signed by the majority 
of the United Nations membership, with a further 18 
signatories being obtained during the course of this 
week.

Outside of the Council, we work directly with 
countries in our region to build their security. Australia 
commends the efforts of Timor-Leste and the Group of 
Seven Plus countries emerging from conflict, including 
Solomon Islands and Afghanistan, in their efforts to 
promote the rule of law, civil and political institutions 
and a strong private sector.

The United Nations is a vital forum for the security 
and prosperity of our world. That is what Harry 
Truman, President of the United States at the time the 
United Nations was founded, imagined when he spoke 
of a “world fabric of international security and growing 
prosperity”. No community can build lives, families 
and nations in the absence of stability, predictability 
and security. No country can ensure the security of its 
people without an economy that offers them the dignity 
to pursue lives they value.

As you have made clear, Mr. President, the task the 
United Nations takes on this year and next, setting the 
stage for the post-2015 development agenda, is one that 
could set the course of humankind for decades to come. 
On behalf of the people of Australia, I wish all nations 
well in taking on that task, and commit Australia to play 
its part. Together, we will strive to build the prosperity 
that underpins and supports international peace and 
security.
"
368,68,2013,PNG,"I am honoured 
to deliver this statement on behalf of Prime Minister 
Peter O’Neill and the people of Papua New Guinea. I 
also wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as 
President of the General Assembly. We welcome your 
overarching theme of “The post-2015 development 
agenda: setting the stage”, advocating a solid global 
foundation for a results-oriented partnership that is 
people-centred and inclusive in our common pursuit of 
sustainable development. Papua New Guinea pledges 
its support to you as you take on that important task. 
We acknowledge the contributions of your predecessor 
and wish him well in his future endeavours.

I take this opportunity to address the Assembly 
on the state of our economy, highlight the challenges 
before us and put forward the policies and development 
plans of my Government.

Papua New Guinea continues to be a vibrant and 
thriving democracy. However, as experienced by other 
developing nations, the road has not been easy in 
terms of the political, economic and social challenges 
that have confronted us domestically and globally. In 
the past, our development efforts have been littered 
with missed economic opportunities. My Government 
is therefore determined to reset the development and 
wealth-creation direction for our nation.

We have set a transformative agenda for our 
country and people under our long-term Papua New 
Guinea Vision 2050 policy framework and five-year 



medium-term development plan. We are determined to 
achieve those development plans, as they continue to 
reinforce our work aimed at achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals and making progress on the post-
2015 development agenda.

Our economy continues to record unprecedented 
growth levels, which can be attributed to a stable 
Government with responsible and sound monetary 
and fiscal policies. Such positive economic growth 
complements the Government’s long-term development 
policies aimed at stimulating the economy and 
achieving our development aspirations. Strategies to 
strengthen economic growth include reinvesting in key 
enablers, such as infrastructure, health and education, 
so as to maximize opportunities and improve the lives 
of our citizens.

My Government is harnessing that positive 
economic growth to address and improve our social 
indicators, including low literacy levels and high 
maternal and infant mortality rates. We have also 
embarked on a major strengthening of law-and-order 
enforcement infrastructure. This year, 50 per cent of 
our budget has been allocated to education and basic 
health care, law-and-order enforcement, and critical 
infrastructure improvement.

My Government is committed to a public-private 
partnership model as an important catalyst for national 
development. We are also committed to strengthening 
existing programmes and networks with the private 
sector, churches, donor agencies and non-governmental 
organizations through cooperative and mutually 
beneficial arrangements.

We are equally committed to investing in provincial 
and local-level government so as to improve service 
delivery for the majority of our population living in 
rural areas. We firmly believe that such partnerships 
will create an enabling environment and empower our 
people to take ownership of their lives and be proactive 
in nation-building.

My Government has also embarked on investor-
friendly policies, supported by public-private 
partnerships and prudent economic management, so 
as to promote growth in key non-mining sectors. In 
that connection, my Government is reviewing taxation 
policies with a view to providing incentives and 
concessions and encouraging strategic investments in 
areas that are critical to driving our economic growth. 
Exporting our raw materials is not an option. We 
therefore encourage downstream processing through 
genuinely joint ventures and other acceptable economic 
cooperation.

My Government is committed to strengthening 
governance at all levels by combating corruption. We 
have adopted the principle of zero tolerance. To that end, 
the Government has adopted a national anti-corruption 
strategy and established an independent task force with 
powers to investigate and prosecute. An independent 
commission against corruption will be established to 
enhance the implementation of the United Nations 
Convention against Corruption.

Given the importance of cross-border security 
and related issues, a national security policy is in the 
final stages of completion. The focus of that policy is 
on dealing with national security issues as contained 
in pillar 4 of the Vision 2050 policy framework. In line 
with our national security policy, we are committed to 
rebuilding our disciplinary forces and institutions as 
well as continuing our participation in United Nations 
peacekeeping operations.

My Government is committed to addressing some 
of my country’s unflattering international human 
development indices, including those regarding 
human rights issues. We recognize our development 
challenges, including gender-based violence, sorcery-
related deaths, access to social services and the low 
level of representation of our women in the public and 
private sectors. In our assessment, many of those human 
rights and human development reports are exaggerated 
and insensitive, with scant attention paid to the positive 
efforts by the Government to promote and protect basic 
rights for all our citizens. Over the past six months, 
my Government has enacted the Family Protection 
Law and repealed the Sorcery Act of 1971, effectively 
making domestic and sorcery-related violence criminal 
offences.

I am pleased to announce that my Government has 
ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The instrument of ratification has been 
deposited with the United Nations at this session.

In recent months, there have been many reports 
about Papua New Guinea’s bilateral agreement with 
Australia on the regional resettlement arrangement for 
asylum-seekers. Papua New Guinea, as a State party 
to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, recognizes 
the importance of addressing that international 



humanitarian issue. Our two Governments are jointly 
working on the issue and call upon the international 
community to support our efforts. Furthermore, we call 
upon like-minded Member States and other stakeholders 
to assist our efforts to address the root causes of the 
displacement and dislocation of people, as well as to 
combat human trafficking and people smuggling.

As an emerging economy in the Pacific region, 
Papua New Guinea will enhance its level of engagement 
on issues of mutual concern, both within the region and 
globally. In the spirit of friendship and neighbourly 
South-South cooperation, we are committed to sharing 
the benefits of our natural resources development with 
our Pacific island neighbours. We have embarked on 
that path by providing development assistance to our 
neighbours, including the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, 
Marshall Islands, Tonga and Samoa.

Through the Melanesian Spearhead Group, we 
are forging dynamic and strong bonds in areas that 
include trade and investment, education and training, 
judicial support, sporting and cultural exchanges and 
visa arrangements to facilitate the movement of skilled 
persons. To further consolidate such very important 
partnerships at the regional level, we are collectively 
reviewing the relevance of the Pacific plan in relation 
to regional integration. Papua New Guinea is playing a 
leading role in that review exercise.

Papua New Guinea supports the outcome document 
of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (Rio+20), entitled “The future we want” 
(resolution 66/288, annex), as the basis for the post-
2015 development agenda. That agenda addresses 
balanced human development, including issues relating 
to eradicating extreme poverty and improving living 
standards for humanity. We also support inclusive 
economic growth, while preserving the environment 
for future generations. We welcome the work of the 
High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 
Development Agenda and the creation of the High-
Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, 
which succeeded the Commission on Sustainable 
Development. Both serve as a good starting point for 
driving the agenda forward.

Papua New Guinea and the Pacific small island 
developing States call on the international community 
to support the inclusion of the oceans as a stand-alone 
sustainable development goal. We are now in the initial 
stages of preparing a sustainable development policy 
and strategy for our country, which is to complement 
our long-term Vision 2050 policy framework. We 
welcome support from the international community to 
enhance that work. 

Papua New Guinea is pleased to note that the 
sustainable development issues of small island 
developing States are a priority on the General 
Assembly agenda, further reaffirming the importance 
of the Rio+20 outcome document and the relevant 
General Assembly resolutions. Your two visits this year 
to our Pacific region, Mr. President, underscore your 
commitment to small island developing States, for which 
we applaud you. We look forward to the strengthening 
of that important work during your presidency.

As the global community prepares for the third 
International Conference on Small Island Developing 
States in September 2014 in Apia, Papua New Guinea 
reiterates the call for small island developing States to 
remain a special case for sustainable development. The 
adverse impacts of climate change continue to be of 
serious concern to the global community, but especially 
for small island developing States. While contributing 
the least to that threat, small island countries are not 
only suffering the most from the serious impacts of 
climate change but also run the risk of being submerged 
by rising sea levels.

We support the Majuro Declaration for Climate 
Leadership, recently adopted by Pacific Island Forum 
leaders. We therefore reiterate the challenge to the 
international community to accept its responsibilities 
and its leadership role. We also urge the international 
community to renew its political commitment to 
prioritize the sustainable development issues of small 
island developing States in the post-2015 development 
agenda. As part of our continued efforts, I am pleased 
to note that Papua New Guinea has now become a 
member of the Governing Council of the Global Green 
Growth Institute.

Papua New Guinea agrees that the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), despite their 
shortcomings, have galvanized the international 
community’s development efforts to shape the post-
2015 development agenda. We agree with the view 
expressed in the Secretary-General’s 2013 annual report 
on the work of the Organization (A/68/1) that we should 
remain focused and redouble our efforts to consolidate 
the implementation of the Millennium Development 
Goals for improved outcomes. We also welcome the 



outcomes of the recently concluded high-level special 
events on the MDGs and on disability and development 
during the sixty-eighth session.

Papua New Guinea is unlikely to achieve most of 
the MDGs by 2015. However, my Government remains 
committed to implementing the goals beyond 2015. 
We have tailored our Millennium Development Goals 
targets and indicators in accordance with our 2011 to 
2015 medium-term development plan and the Vision 
2050 policy framework. We are making progress in 
the areas of universal primary education enrolment, 
poverty reduction, reduced infant and maternal 
mortality rates, combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and 
other health issues and strengthening gender equality 
and empowerment.

Papua New Guinea expresses its appreciation for 
the support it has received from United Nations agencies 
and other development partners complementing 
our efforts to accelerate the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals.

I am pleased to report on the continued progress 
in the implementation of the Bougainville Peace 
Agreement and the successful scaling down of the 
Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. 
We thank the United Nations, regional partners and the 
international community for their continued assistance 
in both instances.

On international peace and security issues, Papua 
New Guinea remains concerned about conflicts and 
tensions in various regions of the world, including in 
the Middle East, North Africa, the Korean peninsula 
and the South China Sea. We urge all parties involved 
to defuse the situation through peaceful dialogue.

We join the international community in condemning 
the use of chemical weapons in Syria and urge full 
compliance with the provisions of the Chemical 
Weapons Convention. We therefore commend the 
Security Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013) 
with a view to dismantling and eradicating Syria’s 
chemical-weapons programme.

Since October 2011, Papua New Guinea has 
been contributing to United Nations peacekeeping 
operations in the Sudan and South Sudan. Earlier this 
year, we became the 148th State Member of the United 
Nations to join the Special Committee on Peacekeeping 
Operations. We are now looking at expanding and 
increasing our troop contributions. We also pay tribute 
to the United Nations peacekeepers serving around the 
world, often in very trying conditions, and especially 
those who have made the ultimate sacrifice with their 
lives.

We express our concern over the lack of progress 
on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. As a 
strong supporter of a nuclear-free world, Papua New 
Guinea calls on the United Nations and the international 
community to address that serious lack of progress. We 
also need to revitalize United Nations disarmament 
work so as to foster international peace and security. 
Papua New Guinea welcomes the adoption of the Arms 
Trade Treaty, which will regulate the trade and transfer 
of conventional arms, including small arms and light 
weapons.

Finally, Papua New Guinea welcomes the leadership 
of the Secretary-General in reforming the United 
Nations system. We encourage robust and constructive 
reforms in the context of the growing budgetary 
constraints faced by the United Nations in recent years. 
A lean, effective and responsive United Nations is 
imperative so that it can better deliver on its mandate. 
We also call for the Security Council to be reformed in 
order to reflect today’s geopolitical realities.
"
386,68,2013,PLW,"At the outset, let me 
extend my congratulations and appreciation to the 
President of the General Assembly for his leadership 
and work with the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth 
session and to the Secretary-General for his continuing 
leadership.

The Palauan flag depicts a yellow full moon against 
a blue ocean. That combination of moon and ocean is a 
metaphor for nature’s balance and harmony through the 
consistency of the rising and falling tides. Just before 
I left to come to the General Assembly, during a full 
moon high tide, my back yard, which nestles against 
the ocean, flooded. Typhoon Usagi passed through the 
Pacific just a few days later and landed in Asia, killing 
many people. It was followed almost immediately by 
Tropical Storm Pabuk.

When I was a child, my back yard did not flood 
and we did not have tropical storm after tropical storm 
pass through our Pacific islands. It is therefore as clear 
to me as it is to other Pacific leaders that the full moon 
and the ocean are no longer metaphors for balance and 
harmony. Today they represent imbalance from our 
past excesses and a lack of harmony due to our current 
inability, as the Secretary-General has so often said, to 
create the world we want.

The leaders and the people of the world certainly 
face many challenges moving forward in creating the 
world we want and in developing a sustainable future. 
In addressing the next round of sustainable development 
goals and in responding to the ever-growing challenges 



of global warming, it is imperative that we all do a better 
job of working together to solve the serious issues that 
we face.

World leaders at the 1992 Earth Summit in 
Rio established a positive and rational vision of 
partnership and sustainable development for the 
world. Unfortunately, that vision seems to have been 
sidetracked. There is therefore frustration in many 
countries today related to our failure to move that vision 
forward, the slow pace in progress in meeting our joint 
goals, and the fear that those goals are being diluted.

Today, it appears that the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change has stalled, that the 
Kyoto Protocol is on life support, and that the United 
Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 
has not done enough to strengthen our three pillars 
of sustainable development. Our job as leaders is to 
reinvigorate our efforts by establishing real mitigation 
commitments and identifying immediate, sufficient 
and long-term implementation financing.

Together, we reaffirmed the principle of common 
but differentiated responsibilities at Rio and moved 
forward with the green economy approach to 
sustainable development issues. We must not allow our 
green economy to become business as usual. Rather, 
we must take concrete actions to make real our stated 
reaffirmation of the principles of the Monterrey 
Consensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing 
for Development. Only then will our sustainable 
development goals discussed at this session of the 
Generally Assembly have a real chance to respond to our 
current worldwide environmental and developmental 
emergency. 

It is clear that what is needed today is 
leadership — leadership from the developed world and 
leadership from the developing world; leadership that 
focuses beyond borders and looks farther than today’s 
problems; ultimately, leadership that creates a broad 
consensus vision to preserve our planet for tomorrow’s 
children. Such leadership must be based upon concrete 
and clear principles that will help guide all of our 
actions.

First, all nations, large and small, must accept 
direct and primary responsibility for global issues that 
threaten our planetary future, and must immediately 
take appropriate action. Secondly, we must protect 
the natural resources of all people and all nations, 
and recognize that no nation has the right to pollute 
the resources of another. Thirdly, we must recognize 
the need for the richer nations of the world to actively 
address actions that threaten the poorer nations of the 
world. Fourthly, we must protect human resources 
through governing strategies that focus on broad-based 
education, health, jobs and equal opportunities, and 
that acknowledge cultures, traditions and homelands. 
Finally, we must agree, in all matters, to promote and 
protect the human rights and peaceful existence of all 
the people of the world. Discussion, not weapons, is 
the best way to resolve differences and uphold human 
rights.

Let me interject here that as we witness so many 
areas of conflict on our planet, I think it is time for all of 
us, as leaders, to use this great institution and our own 
efforts to condemn violence against people, including 
the use of chemical weapons, for any reason, and to 
seek an end to armed conflict wherever we can. The 
events in Kenya are but one of a series of violent acts 
against people that we must work together to eliminate.

Our global warming doomsday is already set 
in stone if we fail to act. It is therefore our job as 
leaders to take all necessary action to eliminate the 
current threat. My country, along with other Pacific 
island nations, is unwilling even to discuss a 3°C-to-
5°C temperature-increase scenario by the end of the 
century, for that will ensure our demise. We are also 
unwilling to discuss the issue of migration. Instead, we 
will continue to work with our developed partners to 
implement strong mitigation commitments and follow-
through action to hold the line on that increase to a 
more realistic 1.5°C level.

My small Pacific country supports the concepts 
inherent in the Majuro Declaration for Climate 
Leadership, issued at the Pacific Island Forum this year. 
The Declaration acknowledges the gross insufficiency 
of current efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. 
It also recognizes the necessity of ramping up climate 
change responses immediately and provides a platform 
for country leaders to establish new and realistic 
reduction commitments. As leaders, we must all 
respond to global warming in both the short and long 
term, from the top down and the bottom up, both pre-
2020 and post-2020.

We should not forget, however, that the primary 
responsibility for reducing greenhouse gases still rests 
with our developed partners. We must therefore use 
the opportunity of the nineteenth session of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 



to be held in Warsaw, and thereafter, to support the 
technical work needed to fast-track the policies and 
technologies appropriate to accomplishing our goal; to 
revive the Kyoto Protocol or develop a more responsive 
alternative, and deliver and expand on commitments 
to reduce greenhouse gases; to phase out inefficient 
fossil-fuel subsidies that distort world oil prices; and 
to arrive at a legally binding agreement to respond to 
and compensate for loss and damage associated with 
the impact of climate change in vulnerable countries.

Here at the United Nations in New York, we must 
deal with global warming security issues by appointing 
a special representative on climate and security to help 
expand our understanding of the security dimensions of 
climate change, and by establishing a joint task force, 
led by the Secretary-General, to assess and expand 
United Nations capacity to respond to the security 
implications of climate change. We must make 2014 
the year of ambition. As host of the forty-fifth Pacific 
Islands Forum, Palau pledges to use that summit to 
build on the Majuro Declaration and to drive greater 
action. As leaders, we must also come to the Secretary-
General’s climate change summit next year ready to 
discuss the new mitigation actions we are prepared to 
take and the plans necessary to see that they are fully 
implemented.

My country is trying with all its might to embrace 
its leadership on issues of sustainable development. To 
date, Palau has committed to providing 20 per cent of 
its energy through renewable sources by 2020 and to 
reducing energy consumption through efficiency and 
conservation efforts. We have also declared and begun 
to implement the Micronesia Challenge, which commits 
the Micronesian region to effectively conserving at least 
30 per cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per 
cent of terrestrial resources by 2020. In that effort, Palau 
and other Micronesian jurisdictions have strengthened 
or established more than 150 protected and managed 
areas covering more than 680,000 hectares, leveraged 
more than $20 million in operational funds and inspired 
other efforts, such as the Caribbean Challenge, the 
Coral Triangle initiative and the Western Indian Ocean 
Coastal Challenge.

In addition, we have recently sponsored the 
creation of a Pacific Islands Forum invasive species 
advisory group to improve regional efforts to reduce 
the expansion of invasive species throughout the 
Pacific. Palau has also pioneered the planet’s first shark 
sanctuary and, finally, recently engaged to pursue our 
most ambitious commitment to date — establishing 
the world’s first comprehensive marine sanctuary, 
which will close Palau’s exclusive economic zone to 
commercial fishing. We ask all the nations of the world 
to move in a similar direction, while recognizing their 
own unique circumstances, to help protect our planet’s 
natural resources. An example of one simple action 
that would have a major impact on saving our shark 
population would be the prohibition of shark’s fin soup. 
That is something that everyone in the world can clearly 
do without.

We are at a historic global moment. A year from 
now, the United Nations will launch the sustainable 
development goals, in a framework that will define 
the relationship between our peoples and our planet 
for generations to come. Through those goals, we must 
commit to a more sustainable use of the oceans. They 
cover two-thirds of the world’s surface and connect 
90 per cent of its population. A billion people are 
dependent on their fish. The oceans’ health is undeniably 
linked to our culture, societies and economies. Yet 
in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the 
oceans received no mention. As the MDGs wind down 
in 2015, we need a new paradigm.

It is therefore time to enunciate our commitment 
to our oceans with a sustainable development goal that 
deals exclusively with them. Drawing from the lessons 
learned from the MDGs, we as leaders must create a goal 
that is resonant, measurable and easily communicated. 
Failure to do so will leave us naked before the shifting 
tides. In our sustainable development goals, we must 
also focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), 
which cause two-thirds of the world’s 57 million deaths 
annually. Within that context, we should also recognize 
that tobacco consumption, which was not included in 
the MDGs, has a direct impact on worsening NCDs and 
must therefore be separately targeted.

None of our leadership goals can be achieved 
without strong partnerships. Fortunately, Palau has 
been blessed over the last half-century with strong 
regional and international partners. I would first like 
to acknowledge the more than 50 years of support and 
leadership shown to us by the United States. We stand 
with the United States in its ongoing efforts to guide the 
international response to the horrific actions in Syria. 
We are also grateful for its very generous economic 
support over the years, and for being a reliable ally on 
which we can depend. We look forward to the final 



completion of the treaty that will renew and reinforce 
our relationship.

Palau would also like to acknowledge the significant 
support we have received over the years from our friend 
Japan. We are hopeful that expansion and reform of the 
Security Council will result in permanent membership 
of the Council for Japan. In addition, we would like 
to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its 
friendship and economic support in helping Palau to 
achieve its Millennium Development Goals and move 
on to the post-2015 development agenda through grants 
and technical assistance in the areas of infrastructure, 
food security enhancement and human capacity. We 
strongly support Taiwan’s expanded participation in 
the United Nations system, acknowledge the expansion 
of its meaningful participation in United Nations 
specialized agencies and mechanisms, and call on the 
United Nations system to accept Taiwan’s participation 
as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts.

Beginning with the leadership of those assembled 
here, and working down to every level of international 
action and cooperation, we can respond, in a timely and 
expedited fashion, to the real emergencies we face. But 
the time for excuses is over. It is now time for leaders 
to lead.
"
440,40,1985,AUS,"I extend my congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of this fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your long service in this body and your extensive diplomatic experience will stand us all in good stead. I would also like to express our sincere congratulations to your predecessor, Mr. Paul Lusaka of Zambia, on his exemplary work throughout the thirty-ninth session.
I would additionally like to express the profound concern and sympathy of the Australian Government and the Australian people to the Government of the Republic of Mexico on the great national and personal tragedy which has beset Mexico City. We trust that the indefatigable energies of the Mexican people and their Government and the commitment and understanding of the rest of the world allow Mexico to rebuild and progress with confidence.
There were plenty of people in 1945, and especially in the dark days in the five or six years following, who would ever have believed that we would survive to celebrate the fortieth birthday of this Organization. Even if only for that fact, we should not begrudge the tone of relief and congratulation in the statements made in this Assembly this year. Over the past 40 years significant progress has been made towards putting into concrete form the decisions of 1945: that we were indeed a global community, that no place could any longer be insulated against the currents of change let loose by a second world war, that in a novel world of independent sovereign nations a coherent system of international authority and solidarity was needed.
This being a special occasion, I intend the Australian statement to be not the usual survey of world developments but more an examination of the condition in which the United Nations finds itself after 40 years.
The development of the United Nations has led us to accept a code of international behavior. Great and successful work has been carried out on codifying international laws on matters such as sovereignty over the sea and the sea-bed which used to be a cause of war. The process of post-War decolonization, which could have been so painful in so many areas, has been eased and enabled. I might say in parenthesis that Australia regrets that the decolonization process in New Caledonia has not gone ahead at the pace which the world community might have expected. We regret it particularly because of the unsettling effect it is having on our region.
Humanity everywhere has benefited from such developments as the recognition that human rights are the rightful concern of the world community. Collective effort has brought about economic and social advance for millions of people who would otherwise have remained mere objects of historical accident or coincidence. It is all but impossible to put a value on the outcome of the activities born in
this collective spirit: the literacy program of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; the United Nations Children's Fund; the United Nations Development Program; the Food and Agriculture organization; the World Food Program and other forms of material assistance; the lives saved by the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; the social profit from such programs as the recent women's Conference in Nairobi; and the International Years of the disabled, of youth and of peace.
For the past 40 years no world war has broken out, though we have been close at times, and an important factor in this success has been the authority and sense of community which has been won by this Organization. I make this last point in the list of blessings which the United Nations has helped bestow on the international community not because it is a cause for congratulations between us here but because it is also a matter which should cause us to think carefully about what we mean by such concepts as peace and progress and community independence. It is a matter which should cause us to reflect on whether or not we can make this Organization serve these concepts more effectively and justly, especially in the context of peace and freedom.
In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General refers to a remark by the late President Franklin Roosevelt which was a guiding signal to the Australian Government at the time. The United Nations, the President said,
'spells - and it ought to spell - the end of the system of unilateral action, exclusive alliances, and spheres of influence, and balances of power, and all the other expedients which have been tried for centuries and have always failed'. (A/40/1, p. 2) If that standard is applied to this Organization, it has to be said that we still have a lot to do.
Let me emphasize a point about our record of there having been no world wars for 40 years. There are people on every continent who would disagree strongly. There are people on every continent who would hold that when we talk about the absence of world war we have a very limited world in mind. There are people on every continent whose world would have been shattered or even destroyed by events that many of us here would call little local difficulties. These people discern from the international structures that we have created, such as the United Nations, that our world is a place in which political, economic and military power is restricted. They observe the great paradox of the United Nations, that, as the international community of independent States has grown, power in it has been given into fewer hands.
The Secretary-General has drawn out attention to an example of this: the impact on many countries of indebtedness and methods of debt-servicing - a complex and sensitive issue. If the rich could hire other people to die for them, as the old saying goes, the poor could make a wonderful living. Measures such as adjustment programs and debt rescheduling are important elements of a strategy which may be successful. I say 'may be' because we cannot yet assume that the problem is solved. Moreover, we have to be careful that the cure will not kill the patient. We have to take care that, while adjustment measures may restore credit-worthiness and stability to debtor countries, they do not undermine the often fragile democracy existing in those countries. And those debtor countries which are going through the adjustment process have every right to expect support from the international community, in policies leading to reasonable exchange rates, for example, in credible exchange rates and in better access to the markets of industrialized countries.
This is an example not only of the concentration of power but also of concentrated power being exercised outside the influence of this Organization. This process began, in fact, when the founding nations gathered to organize the United Nations. In Australia we noted that the topic of discussion was not paths to peace so much as the distribution of power, who should have it, who could share it. This was the grain of sand that was put into the machinery of world government. The machinery works; there is no argument about that: As I have said, it provides world order, world authority and the foundation of a true world community. But the machinery could work better for those who were not present at the power-sharing ceremonies 40 years ago.
At the United Nations we weave complex webs of theology and rhetoric about such developments as apartheid, for example, or disarmament. We have learned to live with these problems. Some of us employ experts who spend their entire careers working at them. Somehow, the problems remain and even grow. This is in spite of the fact that they create concern and sometimes even terror among many people who rely on us for representation. The Australian Government contends that at this fortieth session of the General Assembly we should start the process by which the Organization will become more effective in dealing with such problems for the greater good. I have deliberately nominated apartheid and disarmament because of both their potential for disaster and the better capacity of the United Nations to deal with them.
I do not intend to dwell on the evil nature of apartheid, which is obvious to all here. It is a moral abomination. The South African Government has carried out some cosmetic pruning of it, but its trunk, its main branches and its roots remain, in the main, untouched. The question is, will its inevitable downfall be even more violent than what we have already witnessed or can we help remove it relatively peacefully? Each day of bloodshed in South Africa makes the prospect
of moderation more remote. The Australian Government still maintains, however, that it should try peaceful pressure while it can to persuade the South African Government to abandon a barbaric system which is inevitably heading for massive violence and join a world which has more civilized standards.
Australia has suspended new official investment in South Africa and has prohibited South African Government investment in Australia. Australian banks and other financial institutions have been asked to suspend new loans to borrowers in South Africa. We have taken steps to withdraw our Trade Commissioner from South Africa and to withdraw Government assistance to Australians trading with South Africa. Australia will no longer export to South Africa petroleum products, computers and equipment known to be of use to South African security forces. We have prohibited the import of krugerrands, all other coins minted in South Africa and military supplies, we have introduced a code of conduct for Australian companies operating in South Africa which ensures that they do not profit from the use of racist labor laws and practices. We are preparing a strategy for the meeting next month of the Commonwealth Heads of Government to continue this policy. We have in mind setting up a group of international authorities to work out proposals for peaceful transition in South Africa as well as a group which will study ways in which new investment in South Africa can be suspended.
The Australian Government, furthermore, is working in this Organization for a worldwide, mandatory system of economic sanctions. We appreciate the concern that some governments have that sanctions will hurt black South Africans. They should note, however, that black South Africans themselves are calling for such sanctions, even though they could be put to death for doing so. The South Africans who will suffer most from sanctions will be the privileged white elite who are benefiting most from the apartheid system. Recent overtures by white businessmen to black leaders indicate that business has a clearer vision of reality than the zealots in the South African Government. Australia believes that it is especially important that those countries who are major investors in South Africa should take up an active role in the campaign for sanctions for which Australia will be working.
The case of Namibia is a closely-related problem. As a member of the Council for Namibia and a nation with a close interest in decolonization, Australia is especially concerned at South Africa's flagrant defiance of the United Nations in this matter. The United Nations terminated South Africa's mandate over Namibia nearly 20 years ago. It established the Council as the legal Administering Authority. United Nations resolutions set out a simple and workable plan for the handover of Namibia to its people through free elections. The South African Government's refusal to do this has led to South Africa's forces rampaging in their neighbors' territory and murdering their neighbors' citizens. We condemn South Africa's behavior in this matter, which adds another reason for the Security Council imposing mandatory economic sanctions on a government which is rapidly running out of friends.
Nuclear disarmament is an example of an issue on which significant advance has been achieved; but not so significant as to dispel the fear that many people have about it. By progress, I mean such fundamentally important arrangements as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the SALT I and II agreements. I have especially in mind the non-proliferation Treaty where the Review Conference ended its deliberations only 10 days ago. The non-proliferation Treaty has made an extraordinary contribution to stability in the nuclear age, providing security for all of us - signatories or not. The Review Conference itself was an encouraging example of international co-operation. Treaty partners reaffirmed its validity and strength. But they also argued that it needs to be more effectively implemented in such key areas as the development of the safeguards regime. They drew attention to the urgent need for article VI of the Treaty to be fully implemented and to the particular responsibilities of the nuclear-weapon States. The agreement on a treaty for a South Pacific nuclear-free zone, reached by member States of the South Pacific forum last month, was welcomed at the conference. Nuclear-weapon States are invited to adhere to the relevant protocols of this Treaty. Of course, I repeat the invitation today. The Antarctic is exempted from the international arms race by specific provisions against its militarization. As an Antarctic Treaty party we applaud this and the general manner in which the Antarctic is managed.
So progress has been made on this potentially most destructive problem facing us, But it must also be said that the progress has been slow, often limited and often grudging. The Australian Government says this, not as a bystander wringing its hands, but as an active and sometimes frustrated participant in the disarmament process. We have a right to express this frustration. We understand that the major and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war rests with the nuclear-weapon States, and particularly the super-Powers. In this sense, disarmament suffers from the same irony that afflicts the united Nations as a whole: though the effects of nuclear war would be felt by all, direct power to prevent it is restricted to a few. The few should reflect on this. Probably as many as 30 States, including Australia, have considered acquiring nuclear weapons at one time or other because of the security and status they were thought to provide. Those countries have decided not to do so because they accept the norm laid down in the non-proliferation Treaty that nuclear weapons are simply not acceptable in the progressive world order. In making this decision, those States earned the right to influence the disarmament process, rather than leave it to an exclusive coterie of nuclear Powers. They have earned the right to point out aspects of the process which give them cause for concern.
We in Australia, of course, appreciate the complexities of the process. Our view is that the foremost goal of disarmament negotiations is early and radical reductions in the number of nuclear weapons. If negotiations focus on this and if they take fair account of the valid interest of each party in the maintenance of stability, it should not be all that difficult to identify the numbers and types of weapon systems which could be reduced. Difficulties would arise if the negotiations are not conducted in the fair way I have just described. They would also arise if agreement on reductions is made conditional on other issues. We would be deeply concerned, for instance, if linkage with other, perhaps related, but clearly separate matters held up movement towards reduction of weapons.
Another of our concerns is the possibility of an arms race in space. The Australian Government has declined to endorse the United States strategic defense initiative. We prefer that maximum attention be given to eliminating existing weapons systems, preserving the anti-ballistic missile regime and enhancing international efforts to ensure that activities in space remain exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is necessary to speak plainly in a situation in which there is inadequate clarity about the facts. There should be no weapons system in space, in our view. If there are such systems, and if those who propose the exclusively peaceful use of space have such systems already there, they should remove them. If there is an honest difference in interpreting what constitutes permissible research under the anti-ballistic missile Treaty, those who want to preserve the anti-ballistic missile regime should be able to work the differences out.
The Soviet Union has proposed to the Assembly that we should take a new step towards international co-operation in space. The Australian Government will study the proposal carefully and critically, bearing in mind all the ramifications of the extensive research on this matter which has already been conducted over many years by the Soviet Union.
Our most immediate concern on arms control and disarmament is the failure to agree on a treaty which would prohibit all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time. Such a comprehensive ban is essential to an end to an arms race. This is why it has been sought for the best part of 25 years. This is why commitments to negotiate such a treaty have been made in so many existing international agreements, including the non-proliferation Treaty. And this is why progress towards such a treaty has been so frustratingly slow. The concluding document of the non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference called on the nuclear-weapon states to resume negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as a matter of urgency and before the end of this year. I propose to take up this call at the Assembly, I direct it particularly at those members of the Conference on Disarmament who have withheld consensus on proposals which Australia, New Zealand and others have made so that practical work can be started without delay on the comprehensive test-ban treaty. Procedural wrangling about how that work should be described does a terrible disservice to the community that we represent here.
We all know that there are differences of view on the issues of scope, verification and compliance in such a comprehensive test-ban arrangement. But the only way these differences will be resolved is for us to sit down together and work on them. As the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference proposes, this should be done without more delay. If delay continues, the Australian Government intends to search for an alternative means of settling the problems of scope, verification and compliance. In other words, if there are nuclear-weapon States that have problems with the details of scope, verification and compliance, we intend to work with like-minded non-nuclear-weapon States to establish a working alternative.
Before I leave the disarmament issue, I wish to record the Australian Government's appreciation of the decision by the Government of China, earlier this year, that it would participate in work on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as soon as it is able to be started in the Committee on Disarmament. One nuclear-weapon State, France, chooses by contrast to take no part in discussing the test-ban issue. Moreover, it continues to conduct tests in the Pacific, far from metropolitan France, in what is now within the area of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. It continues to do so over the vehement and consistent protest of the nations in the area. Australia takes no pleasure in disputes with France. But France insists on provoking dispute through its testing policy and activities in the region, which President Mitterrand himself has admitted are an absurd crime and sabotage. This makes us all the more bitter to be told by France that it will not conduct these so-called harmless nuclear tests in France, rather than where we and our friends live. That is why we resent so much acts of so described sabotage on the territory of a nation which considered France to be its friend.
Disarmament and the problems of southern Africa are but two of the major issues before the world community which have caused speculation about the capacity of the international system to resolve long-standing issues on its agenda. I have in mind those problems which threaten international or regional security, such as the tragic turmoil in Lebanon and the continuing occupation of Afghanistan, which we continue to condemn. I repeat Australia's condemnation of Viet Nam's continuing occupation of Cambodia, though we are encouraged by recent signs of progress towards political settlement brought about by the good offices of our friends Indonesia and Malaysia. We have also been heartened by some signs of forward movement towards a comprehensive settlement in the Middle Bast. Despite the deplorable Israeli violation of the sovereignty of Tunisia, we still hope that all sides will work towards early and substantive negotiations. In these and other cases, the ability of this Organization to effect solutions has been limited in various ways. The veto has been used in the Security Council, not in the dispassionate, tutelary manner envisaged 40 years ago, but more to protect the interests of the veto Powers. Threats to the international system come from the effects of underdevelopment and trade inequity, as well as from war. But the Security Council, despite its peace-keeping obligations, shares little if any of the power wielded on these issues through such bodies as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The question arises: Should wider potentially destabilizing issues, as well as military threats, be considered by the Security Council?
Hundreds of thousands of people are being destroyed by the war between Iraq and Iran. Twenty-five Members of this Organization - some of them with great influence - sell arms to one or other of the combatants. Nine Member nations sell arms to both. Should United Nations Members be allowed without penalty to turn the Iraq-Iran war into a gigantic arms bazaar as well as a channel house? Practical answers to these terrible problems are available and they can be forged by this Organization. It is my Government's hope that the Security Council will be able, impartially, to assist both countries in moving towards a resolution of this terrible conflict.
The record of the United Nations in easing the decolonization process is an immutable one, as I have pointed out. But colonization survives and even in its last moments it causes pain and tension. We see something of this especially in the Pacific region. The question perhaps might be ashed: Should decolonization, its pace and its extent, be left to the colonizing Power or should it be a matter for involvement by this Organization?
Prevention of nuclear war is the most immediately pressing task facing us today. This demands nuclear disarmament. Negotiations on the issue are proceeding in Geneva, and we are all grateful for that. It has to be appreciated that the minutiae of arms control arrangements can practically be dealt with only by those immediately involved. But the ramifications of arms control arrangements, or lack of such arrangements, flow beyond the borders and responsibilities of those immediately involved. Is there a case for the proposal by my colleague from Burkina Faso for the Security Council, the world's paramount peace-keeping organization, to meet especially to discuss peace and disarmament in the context of world economic and social development? Should the Council be reformed to reflect more accurately the world as it is today? The United Nations and its institutions have contributed to peace and progress on a scale and in ways that almost defy valuation. Could it do even better without structures which may be found, after careful evaluation, to be perhaps imperfect or outdated?
These questions, of course, have been heard before. They are heard more often as the United Nations advances into respectable maturity. They were raised at the Security Council last week, where a degree of consensus evolved in favor of the need for greater commitment and efficiency. Australia raises them here in an attempt to get the issues that they raise examined while we are of a mind to reflect on our achievements and our failures. We raise these questions in a spirit of active and profound loyalty to the United Nations and its ideals.
Australia is one of the founding and original Members of the United Nations. We are a member of the Security Council. We have provided moral, physical and financial support for a vast range of United Nations activities: from control over narcotics, keeping the peace, improving the status of women and the health of children to the survival of refugees. In all these activities, the Australian Government has had the benefit of the great goodwill of the Australian people. We appreciate the complications of the system. We understand the drawbacks of the political process. We know that nations cannot be expected to ignore genuine national interests. But we also realize that the United Nations will get nowhere if we are not also fueled by the idealism which created such concepts as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Program and the Conference on Disarmament. We should therefore take our fortieth anniversary as an opportunity to renew this idealism, committed to ensuring that the operations and structure of the United Nations are not vehicles for our own shortcomings or ambitions, but are relevant to a world whose complexity and needs could not have been even imagined 40 years ago.
"
502,40,1985,NZL,"I must begin by expressing the profound regret of the New Zealand people at the terrible earthquakes in Mexico. Our thoughts are with the people of Mexico. New Zealand is a country which is subject to earthquakes - we know the devastation they can cause.
It is a privilege and a pleasure for me to address the Assembly over which Ambassador de Pinies presides. I first came to the United Nations as a student intern in the 1960s. By then Ambassador de Pinies had already been a prominent figure here for some years. It is entirely appropriate that he should now have been elected to the Assembly's highest office. I offer him my congratulations, and the full support of my delegation for his efforts to make this fortieth session a fruitful and memorable one.
As we celebrate this fortieth anniversary of the United Nations, the thoughts of all of us must turn to reflect on the aspirations and objectives that were pursued with such energy and confidence when the Charter of this Organization was drawn up. For a New Zealand representative it is natural to remember with pride that our Prime Minister of the day, the Right Honorable Peter Fraser, contributed to this original process with statesmanlike vigor. Today especially I wish to recall and pay homage to the leading role he played in seeking to assert the rights of small countries to the maximum possible protection under the Charter against the vicissitudes of international life and in the aftermath of two World Wars.
Now, forty years on, this is no less cogent a problem. My Government, by irony of fate, finds itself at this rostrum again concerned to see maintained, in difficult circumstances, the sovereign rights of a small state against the increasingly complex and sophisticated pressures that are generated from larger
countries within the international community.
It continues to be ray Government's apprehension that, forty years on, the atomic weapon has kept its malign pace along with the existence of the United Nations. No less than in 1945, the horrific atomic shadow still falls across all
our proceedings.
In saying that, I am not expressing a platitude. My point is that the continued development of this weapon over the lifetime of our organization has in fact succeeded in distorting the fabric of international life. In our own experience it conditions the sovereign freedoms we had thought in 1945 were once and for all assured to us. At the very least as policies of power are pursued it has impinged on standards or international morality and behavior.

In such a political climate, it is natural that smaller countries may turn to the possibilities of collective self-help that the Charter of the United Nations encourages. It is indeed to the advantage of the United Nations that each country contributes the perspective of that part of the world in which it finds itself -the South Pacific - there has over recent years been a growing perception that great Power rivalries could start to extend to our region. The fact is, however, that the strategic circumstances of the South Pacific are not those of the northern hemisphere; nor has the South Pacific so far been an area of great-Power confrontation. It need never be; and our own security is best served by keeping it so.
Against that background the countries in the region have acted. We have set in being the best practical measure of agreed arms control available to us to guard against the emplacement of nuclear weapons in our midst. As was announced earlier this year, the South Pacific Forum countries endorsed and opened for signature on 6 August, the anniversary of Hiroshima Day, a treaty establishing the world's second nuclear-weapon-free zone in a permanently inhabited area. This South Pacific nuclear free zone Treaty signals in no uncertain terms the deeply anti-nuclear sentiments of our peoples, and their desire to live in peace and independence and to run their own affairs in accordance with their own wishes.
It is basic to their peace of mind that there should be no use, testing or stationing of nuclear explosives in the South Pacific, and that the activities of the South Pacific countries themselves should fully respect and fulfill the aims of such applicable international measures as the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
To these ends, all parties to the South Pacific nuclear free zone Treaty undertake not to possess, manufacture or acquire nuclear explosive devices anywhere, nor allow them to be stationed on their territory. They also undertake to prevent the diversion of fissionable material to non-peaceful purposes, and not to dump radioactive waste at sea in the zone.
Under the Treaty, South Pacific countries retain their unqualified sovereign rights to decide for themselves, consistently with their support for these objectives, their security rights, and such questions as the access to their ports and airfields by vessels and aircraft of their countries. The Treaty is not, therefore, some sort of disguised attempt to undermine existing military alliances. It is a determined effort to ensure that the South Pacific is not riven by the tensions which have overshadowed so many other parts of the world.
To the South, the Zone borders the area of another and much older agreement -the Antarctic Treaty. We value that Treaty not just because of the nuclear-free and demilitarized zone it establishes for Antarctica but because for 25 years it has effectively guaranteed the stability of the region to the South of New Zealand. It remains the only possible guarantee that that region will continue to remain free from international rivalry and conflict.
To the East, the new zone borders the area covered by the Treaty of Tlatelolco. The joining of the areas covered by that Treaty and the Antarctic Treaty with the vast area covered by the new Treaty means that a large part of the Southern hemisphere has declared its determination to be free of nuclear weapons. As my own Prime Minister said last year to this General Assembly:
'This initiative represents, I believe, a major advance for the region. It would not, we know, spare us from the consequences of nuclear war but, when in place, it would significantly strengthen the existing measures, both global and regional, to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.' (A/39/PV.7, p. 11) Now in 1985, with the Treaty concluded and awaiting in due course its entry into force, we see it as a fitting contribution to this anniversary of the United Nations that we are celebrating.
I should add that the South Pacific Forum countries hope that the five nuclear States will, after consultation with them, sign the relevant Protocols to this Treaty. Thereby they would agree not to use, or threaten to use, nuclear explosive devices against any country or territory in the zone. They would also undertake not to test nuclear explosive devices there.
In this anniversary year of the United Nations, it is painful to have to point out once again that one of the nuclear-weapon states continues to test nuclear explosives in the South Pacific, against the manifest and long-established wish of all the countries in the area that this activity should cease.
These nuclear testing activities have this year led to a new turn of events in the region which, because of its gravity, I am bound to bring to your attention.
Politically motivated offenses and terrorism have been virtually unknown in New Zealand in the past. But the scene has changed as a result of the incident in July 1985 in which the Greenpeace vessel 'Rainbow Warrior' was sunk at its berth in Auckland, New Zealand, by a bomb attack which killed a crew member. The circumstances indicated international terrorism. It was well known that the vessel was intended to sail to French Polynesia to protest against the continuation of nuclear explosions at Mururoa Atoll. The incident has gained world-wide attention, and the New Zealand Government has made known its determination to bring those responsible to full account for this outrage. Large scale investigations by the New Zealand police are still under way. Within New Zealand, two French nationals have been arrested and charged with murder, arson and conspiracy, and are due to come before the court in New Zealand in November this year.
I shall not expand upon this notorious incident in detail, except to note that the latest public pronouncement by the Prime Minister of France, after the French Government's own most recent investigations, has acknowledged that agents of the French secret services did indeed sink the 'Rainbow Warrior', acting under orders to that effect. It had earlier been established that, for the purpose of surveillance of the Greenpeace fleet, elements of French military forces had been deliberately introduced into New Zealand, under orders from their Government, without the permission of the Government of New Zealand and in derogation of our sovereignty.
Small States must place reliance on international law and we must rely on the protection which the international community, through the United Nations, can give us in circumstances of this serious nature.
Inquiries into the 'Rainbow warrior' incident are still being pursued, and the Government of New Zealand is concerned that a traditionally good and highly valued relationship with the Government of France should continue. I am bound to note that the New Zealand Government addressed on 6 September 1985 a formal communication to the Government of France.
In that message New Zealand has reserved its legal position and its rights of action under international law, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, with respect to matters arising from this unfortunate incident. That is a clear enunciation of our position in relation to an issue which is shown to implicate the responsibility of the French Government.
It is certainly my Government's hope that the most recent statement by the French Prime Minister will provide a basis for resolving outstanding questions . between the two Governments arising out of the affair. And I am very pleased to report to the Assembly today that only last evening I met with the French Minister for Foreign Relations, Mr. Dumas, at the New Zealand Mission to the United Nations. He began to discuss possible ways to find solutions to problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior incident, and we have agreed to have another meeting within the next few days.
By virtue of their vulnerability, smaller States have often felt that they must take additional steps to preserve their Charter rights. In the years following the Second World War, a number of countries, including New Zealand, moved, consistently with the Charter, into defensive treaty alliances. This has not meant, however, that countries such as New Zealand have forsaken their right to think for themselves or have abandoned significant sovereign rights. That was not intended.
New Zealand, for example, as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, has forgone the possession of nuclear weapons. We have also declared unambiguously that we do not want any country to defend New Zealand with nuclear weapons. In short, my Government does not seek to be part of any calculation that involves the accumulation of nuclear weapons. We will not have any nuclear weapons on our territory. We will not allow any to be brought in. And ships that are nuclear armed will not come into New Zealand ports.
As will be clear from what I have already said in relation to the South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty, we have taken our own stand on principle, because in the South Pacific there is no need for a build-up of nuclear armaments - indeed, the reverse is true.
The stand we have taken is fully consistent with New Zealand's active membership of the Western community. We see our participation in that community, our partnership with our friends and neighbors in the South Pacific and our support for this world Organization as cumulatively strengthening the fabric of peace in our part of the world.
In practical terms, the effect of the re-evaluation of our interests that we have undertaken will be a new concentration of New Zealand's efforts on our immediate neighborhood. This will involve an expansion of New Zealand's political, economic and defense activities in the South Pacific region and the assertion of an increasingly active role there. This new and strengthened regional approach should provide the basis for a continued, sound and stable relationship with Australia and the United States based on a clear definition of New Zealand's interests and a policy of self-reliance.
Events of recent years lead one to ponder whether the reiteration of the ideals of our Charter over the past 40 years has not bred a measure of easy familiarity, even of complacency, against which we should be very much on our guard in the period ahead. Even those States which themselves generated the great national revolutions - revolutions which inspired the League of Nations and our Charter - have only imperfectly acknowledged in practice the full implications of the existence of newly independent States and the democratic rights those States are perfectly entitled to see maintained and protected.
I hope that our ocean region will not be vulnerable in that respect. It certainly need not be, and it is already organized in regional ways to assert its own distinctive voice internationally*
Here, the United Nations can take its due credit in helping a tide of decolonization which has changed the political map of the Pacific dramatically. In 1945 no island country was independent; in 1985 12 are. United Nations stewardship has often been instrumental in the peaceful achievement of self-determination. The Charter, as well as the 1960 Declaration on decolonization, provided the guiding beacons for the navigators who plotted the course towards independence, and the Special Committee of 24 has monitored progress. It still continues to do so, and New Zealand will be happy to receive next year a Visiting Mission from the Committee to the last remaining overseas responsibility which New Zealand has - the island community of Tokelau.
Decolonization in the South Pacific is not yet complete. In Micronesia to the north, lengthy negotiations per many years with the United States have produced Compacts of Free Association which have the support of the relevant peoples of the Trust Territory. We do not believe that unilateral changes should be made now to the agreed definition of the future relationship between the United States and the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. We will, however, look for and support an early termination of the Trusteeship Agreement in respect of those parts of the Trust Territory, in accordance with the expressed wishes of the peoples. We look forward to welcoming the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau into membership of the South Pacific Forum before too long.
Further south, the region watches anxiously the difficulties faced by the people of New Caledonia in building a consensus for independence in that country. The rights and aspirations of the indigenous Kanak people must be met in the context of New Caledonia's multiracial society. We regret the violence and loss of life which have occurred over the past year. New Zealand supports the present plan for the establishment of regional councils and a congress, leading to a referendum on self-determination before the end of 1987. We welcome the recognition by the administering Power, France, that independence is the logical outcome of this process. It will be important to ensure that the steps outlined are adhered to. The Kanaks have been disappointed too often in the past. Only by following a predictable and short pathway to independence can further disruption and violence be avoided.
I have already noted that political emancipation and the assertion of a say in their own destiny have led the South Pacific countries to early recognition of the desirability of co-operation with each other. Political independence in the Pacific, as elsewhere, is not automatically accompanied by economic self-determination, but acting together has strengthened the voice of the region in international forums. And it can assist in tackling some of the intractable problems arising from smallness, isolation and a scarcity of resources. The island States depend heavily on external assistance. The international price of copra and sugar has a profound affect on people's daily lives. Some significant regional efforts have been made under the auspices of the South Pacific Forum to improve trade access, shipping, telecommunications and the knowledge and control of marine mineral and fishing resources.
Distant water fishing nations have been less respectful of the region's main resource in the past. This situation is improving, largely as a result of the evasiveness of the Pacific Forum nations, and important multilateral negotiations with the Government of the United States on a treaty regulating fishing are currently under way. A successful conclusion will make possible control of purse seiner activity within the 200-mile economic zones of Pacific signatories, and eliminate an area of serious friction. New Zealand looks to the United Nations and other international bodies to continue to help is overcoming the problems of economic security for the very small island States, in support of the region's own efforts to do so.
One issue on which the countries of the South Pacific are united is that of racial discrimination. We all have multiracial societies; we are all committed to making racial harmony the foundation for our nation-building. It follows that we are all totally opposed to the systematic racial discrimination that is practiced in South Africa under the name of apartheid. Since my Government came to office last year we have demonstrated our commitment to that cause: the South Africans have closed their consulate in Wellington, and a proposed rugby tour of South Africa has been canceled. All New Zealanders are appalled the rising tide of violence that is threatening to engulf South Africa. The South African Government must be persuaded to institute the necessary reforms before it is too late. It must be brought to realize that it cannot maintain apartheid by force. It must talk unconditionally to the leaders of the black majority. It must accept that racial partnership offers the only hope for the future of that tormented country. All of us must do whatever we can in a concerted way to produce this result. New Zealand's contacts with South Africa, whether economic or otherwise, are now minimal. I need hardly say that we shall readily comply with any additional sanctions imposed by the international community;
I have focused on practical issues of importance to our Pacific neighborhood - because it is in workable solutions to those issues that the elements lie for continued stable and peaceful development in the South Pacific. He are aware of the larger dimensions to all these problems, and notably of the tensions that impede the prospect of achieving genuine disarmament in our time.
Implicit in what I said earlier is that my part of the world is by no means impressed either with the speed of the global disarmament process or with the failure of the nuclear Powers to read an agreement on limiting their nuclear arsenals.
In the General Assembly last year my Government gave expression to the conviction amongst New Zealanders, as amongst peoples everywhere, that nuclear weapons expose to annihilation those whom they purport to protect; that each new development in nuclear weaponry opens up a more alarming and a potentially more destabilizing prospect than the last. There are already more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy us all many times over. Yet the number goes on increasing. The dilemma is recognized universally. TO control the spread of nuclear weapons and eventually to eliminate them completely are goals of the greatest importance. Where those who have them and those who do not seem to differ is in the sense of urgency. And it is to the United Nations that smaller countries such as my own must look to express that agonizing conviction, which has so recently been voiced by the vast majority of countries assembled at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference just concluded in Geneva. 
A year age the Soviet Union agreed to take up the offer of the United States to resume bilateral arias control negotiations, with the goal of leading to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons everywhere. My Government greatly welcomed that move. The issues are complex. We know only too well that there will be no easy or necessarily quick solutions. But solutions are not beyond the skills of negotiation if the political will is there. New Zealand calls on the negotiating parties to pursue their task with good faith and the utmost urgency. The time is past for picking around the edges of the agenda or for diversionary proposals -time-bound and shrouded in propaganda.
We would view with the deepest concern any prospect of competition between the major Powers extending into yet another environment - outer space. But we do not accept that there can be no progress in the talks on strategic weapons and intermediate-range nuclear forces as long as there is no agreement on outer space. The talks must not be held hostage in this way.
Much hangs on the meeting that will take place shortly between President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev. We most earnestly hope for a successful outcome. We do not for a moment underestimate the complexities of the issues the two leaders must deal with. But we urge them to set a framework for a new co-operation from which the negotiations in Geneva may derive the momentum they need to reach agreements to stop the arms race.
At the same time, the efforts of the international community towards meaningful international arms control agreements must continue. The Conference on Disarmament addresses many important issues. No task is more difficult than to forge reliable instruments of international law. But progress in the Conference on Disarmament is, at best, haltingly slow. We urge it to get on with its tasks with commitment and determination.
This Assembly considers many disarmament and arms control proposals in the course of its deliberations. Many of these recommend what is practical and achievable. Some are symptomatic only of an ideological divide.
One of the most serious proposals before the Assembly will again be the draft resolution, jointly sponsored by New Zealand end Australia, urging the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban. A comprehensive test ban, banning all testing in all environments permanently, is regarded by virtually all States as the most immediate and practical step that can be taken to halt and then reverse the arms race. Balanced, practical, verifiable, it will be a major restraint on the spread of nuclear weapons. It will straitjacket the development of new types of weapons without undermining existing strategic balances. It will inhibit compulsive competitiveness among the nuclear Powers.
On two occasions, in the early sixties and in the late seventies, agreement was almost achieved on a comprehensive test ban. We have been disappointed by the setbacks which have prevented such a prohibition from being put in place. My delegation will again seek the means to encourage and speed up this work.
We are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Time has not produced universal contentment with this Organization. Some of the criticisms which have been made arise from exaggerated and unrealistic expectations. As the Secretary-General reminds us in his latest annual report, the United Nations is not a super-State. It cannot do more than its Members will allow it to do. The policies of Member States have so far prevented the Organization from exercising some of the powers given it by the Charter. They have also prevented it from achieving some of its fundamental purposes. Those are facts.
It is also a fact that the Charter remains the only universally accepted basis of international order. The principles it enshrines are generally recognized today, as they were 40 years ago, to be essential for world peaces and those principles are the foundations of the international regime under which we all live - a regime which, with all its failings, gives individual countries and peoples more freedom than they have ever had before. The United Nations is today the beacon of hope for all small nations. It is their democratic voice by which they can express their fears and their aspirations.
The essential function of this Organization is to uphold the principles of the Charter. First in importance is the principle that 'all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force'. Living, as we do, under the threat of nuclear annihilation, we have as strong a common interest as ever in supporting the United Nations and helping to achieve this, its most elusive, but its moat vital, objective.

507,40,1985,PNG,"My delegation and I would like to congratulate you most sincerely, Sir, on your election to the presidency of this important fortieth anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly. In wishing you success in all your deliberations, I assure you of my delegation's support and confidence in you throughout your term of office.
I wish to extend our congratulations also to your predecessor, Mr. Paul Lusaka, on the matter in which he discharged his responsibilities and guided the deliberations of the thirty-ninth session.
Ten years ago, when my country was admitted as a Member of the United Nations, my Prime Minister, Michael Somare, stated from this rostrum that our fundamental commitment was to the maintenance of peace and security throughout our region and the world. He also stated that Papua New Guinea would undertake to uphold the principles and purposes of the Charter. As our track record indicates, Papua New Guinea has lived up to its commitments. On this fortieth anniversary of the
founding of the United Nations, let me reaffirm Papua new Guinea's obligation and commitment to upholding the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.
In his 1984 annual report to this Assembly, the Secretary-General stated that 'The original intent of the United Nations was to provide a framework in which Governments of different persuasions could, in their wisdom, work out solutions to international problems and, if necessary, together take action to put those solutions into effect rather than engaging in conflict'. (A/39/1, para. 2)
The main purpose was, and continues to be, to unite our commitments and obligations to maintain international peace and security.
Papua New Guinea, which last month celebrated the tenth anniversary of its independence, is a young, flourishing democracy whose Government is structured on the Westminster system. We have had changes of Governments, all through the democratic parliamentary process and in accordance with our Constitution.
The Papua New Guinea Government's basic approach in the conduct of its foreign relations is one of active and selective engagement. Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have tried to strengthen and consolidate relations with countries with which we share important interests. An important aspect of this policy is Papua New Guinea's developing relations with member States of the South Pacific Forum and the Association of South-East Asian Nations, with member nations of the European Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement, with the People's Republic of China, Japan, the United States of America and the Republic of Korea.
Papua New Guinea's relations with the island developing countries of the South Pacific are based on culture, ethnicity and shared interests. Co-operation with these countries is generally conducted through two regional organizations. They are the South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Conference.
In recent years, leaders of the South Pacific island countries have increasingly become concerned with certain regional issues which have not been given the necessary attention and the publicity they deserve. Pacific leaders realize that one of the best ways of tackling pressing issues of crucial importance to the people and countries of the region is by promoting regional consultation and co-operation.
Our relations with the independent island countries of the South Pacific are among those of primary concern to us. We welcome increased, constructive participation in regional affairs by metropolitan countries with traditional ties to the region, as well as by Japan, China and South Korea. We are critical of Governments which deny the rights and independence of island Governments.
Papua New Guinea, together with other South Pacific Forum countries, has long advocated a nuclear-free zone in our region. For several years now we have protested in the strongest terms possible at the French Government's nuclear-weapon-testing program on Mururoa Atoll. However, despite those protests, the French Government continues to conduct nuclear tests on Mururoa. Papua New Guinea strongly condemns this arrogant attitude and calls upon France to comply with the wishes of the people of the region.
We welcome Prime Minister Nakasone's pledge that Japan will not dump nuclear wastes in the Pacific.
Recently, with other members of the region, Papua New Guinea has signed a treaty that would make the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone.
As has been expressed here on numerous occasions by Papua New Guinea representatives, we consider colonialism an anachronism of our time. We therefore find it disturbing that as long as 25 years after the adoption of the historic 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, 19 Non-Self-Governing Territories and one Trust Territory continue to languish under this system of the past. Papua New Guinea believes that the people of dependent and Non-Self-Governing Territories must be given the opportunity to exercise their inalienable right to genuine self-determination.
With regard to the special problems of small dependent Territories, they must not be denied self-determination simply because of their size, geographic location, population or limited natural resources, and it is for them, and them alone, freely to express the form they wish to adopt in order to achieve the objectives of resolution 1514 (XV).
If dependent peoples are to be able to make an informed and reasoned decision on their political status, adequate political education must be conducted by the administering Power concerned to enable them fully to understand the options available to them, as well as the likely implications of those options. There must be a greater and more meaningful participation by the indigenous peoples in the affairs of their respective dependent Territories. Appropriate Administering Authorities should promote investment in self-help projects appropriate to the needs and resources of those dependent Territories. In this respect, it is essential that they review the use of transnational corporations in the economic development of these dependent Territories.
While colonialism is gradually being phased out, certain parts and peoples of the world continue to be saddled with the burden of conflicting territorial claims by metropolitan Powers. Papua New Guinea hopes that the anguish and uncertainty of these peoples can soon be ended. We urge those responsible to resolve the difficulties in a manner that avoids a further impasse.
In this regard, we remind those States disputing each other's territorial claims that they have an obligation to respect the wishes and well-being of the peoples of those dependent Territories.
Like other independent Pacific island countries, Papua New Guinea is particularly concerned about the remaining dependent Territories of the Pacific region.
We are indeed happy to note that after years of painstaking negotiations between the United States and the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, a compact of free association, agreed to between the parties, is
pending before the United States Congress for ratification. We urge the United States Government to honor the originally agreed arrangements under the compact that was negotiated and accepted by both parties.
In contrast to the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, a third political entity in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Palau, has yet to conclude an appropriate compact of free association with the administering Power. We trust that this impasse is only temporary and that both parties will soon find a mutually acceptable formula whereby Palauans will be allowed to exercise their inalienable right of self-determination at the earliest possible date.
Papua New Guinea, however, stands firm in its criticism of any attempts by the Administering Authority to circumvent the Palauan Constitution for reasons of
political expediency. We shall therefore continue to advocate respect by the administering Power for the provision in the Palauan Constitution which outlaws the entry of nuclear weapons into Palau.
Of particular concern to us is Mew Caledonia, which presents a crucial and highly pressing decolonization issue that still remains unsolved. Since our independence 10 years ago we have felt obliged to support the aspiration to independence of our Pacific island neighbors. Our resolve in this respect is as resolute as it ever was. He will continue to persist in our endeavors to bring pressure to bear on France to grant the indigenous population of New Caledonia the genuine exercise of its inalienable right to self-determination. Until several months ago we had some reason to believe that France had a genuine intention to accord New Caledonians their inalienable right to self-determination.
It is with the deepest sense of regret that I report here today that the French Government plans to boost its military presence in New Caledonia. It appears quite clear to us that the planned increase in the French military presence in New Caledonia proves beyond reasonable doubt the intention o£ France to maintain New Caledonia as a colony indefinitely.
Papua New Guinea fails to understand why the French Government should make such plans while calls for the decolonization of New Caledonia and modalities for the exercise of self-determination by the New Caledonians are yet to be resolved.
In the light of the events that followed the Territorial Assembly elections last year, this latest move by the French Government can only be viewed by Papua New Guinea as an act of intimidation of the Kanaks and as an effort to influence the outcome of any act of self-determination.
We are encouraged, however, to learn that, despite an active campaign by the French anti-independence sector in New Caledonia, the Kanaks won three out of four regional elections last month. Nevertheless, the majority of the seats in the Central Congress are still held by those in favor of the French anti-independence settlers. This does not guarantee that New Caledonia will become independent in the near future.
We urge the Administering Authority to make further arrangements, including appropriate electoral reforms, to facilitate the full implementation of united Nations General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). In this regard we call upon the United Nations to consider the applicability of the United Nations Charter and the historic 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in line with the recent Forum communique.
Papua New Guinea shares a common land border with the Republic of Indonesia, which is an important member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The effective and orderly administration of the Papua New Guinea/Indonesian border is governed by the Basic Agreement on Border Arrangements, signed in 1979 between the two countries and revised in 1984. On the part of Papua New Guinea, the success of the border regime established under the Basic Agreement is based on good understanding and actively encouraged through a policy of independent neighborly co-operation between the two countries.
This is not to say that management of the common land border has not been without any difficulties and problems. We have had differences of views on various aspects of border development and administration. However, our ability to exercise a high level of flexibility and mutual respect in trying to understand and appreciate each other's style of approach to solving border problems has contributed immensely towards minimizing the chances of their escalating into serious border conflicts such as have been experienced by others in similar situations.
Papua New Guinea has developed close and meaningful relations with individual ASEAN member states. Our relations with ASEAN are unique, in that we are the only country that enjoys special observer status with ASEAN. We have actively sought co-operation with ASEAN and I am pleased to state that we have been invited to participate in selected technical and functional areas.
Our relations with member countries of the European Economic Community (EEC), Japan, the People's Republic of China, South Korea and the United States of America have markedly increased over the past few years. We welcome this increase in our relations with those countries and look forward to exploring new areas for co-operation.
As a special observer vis-a-vis the Non-Aligned Movement, Papua New Guinea hopes to maintain an active outlook on matters that affect the interests of the third world. We have supported and will continue to support issues of major concern to less-developed countries that are advanced by the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement. We would like to record our appreciation to the many prominent leaders of the third world who have made a commitment to pursuing collective third-world interests.
Once again the General Assembly is meeting at a time when the very fabric of international peace, security, stability and prosperity is being assailed by increased global disharmony and economic inequity. As the Secretary-General observed in his report, the past year has been a time of great-Power tension, of heightened violence in several parts of the world, of continued economic difficulties and of a deterioration of the situation in many developing countries.
It is Papua New Guinea's view that the United Nations must produce a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. During the last two sessions of the General Assembly, Papua New Guinea supported resolutions which formed a basis for the development of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We will continue to lend our support this year. We would also like to see the United Nations mandate a working group of the Conference on Disarmament to allow urgent practical work to be done towards such a treaty.
Respect for the national sovereignty of all States and for international borders is an important principle in international relations and must be upheld. The use of superior economic and military strength to invade small countries for the purpose of securing spheres of influence is a matter of the utmost concern to Papua New Guinea. We have witnessed a resurgence of this deplorable phenomenon in Kampuchea, in Cyprus, in Lebanon, in Afghanistan, in Angola, in Namibia and, most recently, in Botswana. Papua New Guinea strongly condemns the perpetrators of those outrageous acts.
The Papua New Guinea Government condemns the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the subsequent installation of a puppet regime. We reaffirm our support for the principles embodied in the 1981 Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea.
The Papua New Guinea Government firmly believes that the withdrawal of all foreign forces is necessary for genuine dialog.
Papua New Guineas believes that the crisis in the Middle East can never be resolved unless the principal parties to those conflicts recognize that they all have a right to exist. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), to which Papua New Guinea subscribes, offer a framework for the settlement of the conflict.
The question of Namibia has long been a focus of international attention and United Nations efforts. However, no amount of international censure of South Africa's illegal presence and activities in Namibia has elicited the right response from the Pretoria regime. Papua New Guinea has no reason to believe that South Africa has any genuine intention of implementing the united Nations plan for Namibia's independence, as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978), which is the only internationally recognized formula for Namibia's independence. Papua New Guinea continues to support that resolution.
In spite of the fact that the United Nations has declared apartheid to be a crime against humanity, South Africa continues to run its affairs on the basis of that obnoxious system. Papua New Guinea strongly deplores the current violence directed against blacks and extends its condolences to the innocent victims.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the recent direct dialog between North and South Korea in the hope that it will lead to a reduction of tension in the Korean Peninsula. Papua New Guinea urges Members of the United Nations to help create a better political environment for a peaceful solution of the Korean question by encouraging both sides to continue the dialog.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the adoption of the Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982. However, we are disappointed that since then certain countries not only have sought to alter various fundamental provisions of the Convention but also continue to find reason not to accede to it. Of particular interest are the provisions relating to the exploitation and management of fisheries. Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency countries have been negotiating a multilateral fisheries access agreement with the United States.
We are concerned, however, that the United States has been reluctant to recognize the rights of coastal States over highly migratory species within their 200-mile economic zone. Furthermore, past experience has shown that coastal States face a very real threat of economic sanctions by the United States for exercising their rights over their 200 mile economic zone. Papua New Guinea appreciates that there have been some changes in the United States attitude, and therefore, looks forward to an early, and favorable, conclusion of the above-mentioned agreement.
Papua New Guinea recognizes that the recovery that has been under way in parts of the world economy has spread unevenly, and has by-passed entirely a large part of the developing world. In many developing countries growth and development have been severely hampered, and in some countries have halted altogether. Papua New Guinea is concerned at the very real risk of many more developing countries facing an unmanageable crisis of debt and development should the economies of the industrial States fail to achieve a lasting recovery.
In this respect, Papua New Guinea welcomes the view expressed by the leaders of industrial countries represented at the Bonn summit in June that the prosperity of developed and developing countries has become increasingly linked and therefore we should all work together in a spirit of true partnership. Like other developing States, Papua New Guinea's economic prospects are largely determined by external economic factors which are beyond our control. Consequently the notion of true partnership in international economic co-operation has a very real meaning for our economic survival and the provision basic human needs.
In this, the 40th anniversary of the United Nations, Papua New Guinea would like to urge all Member nations to give a real and practical meaning to that partnership, we need prompt and practical action now if we are serious about dealing effectively with the important challenges that confront us today. Some of the proposals for action include increasing the resources of and lending by multilateral institutions, strengthening commodity export earnings, moving decisively to meeting the Official Development Assistance (ODA) targets and ensuring greater and more secure access to markets in developed countries.
The Papua New Guinea Government welcomes the commitment made by participants in the London economic summit last year and the Bonn summit this year to urge resistance to and reduction of protection. But, as I have already suggested, what we seek is prompt and practical action. In addition, the Government of Papua New Guinea has acceded to the Common Fund set up under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). My Government does not see why there is continuing- delay in bringing the Fund into operation.
Papua New Guinea appeals to all Member States of the United Nations to show a greater degree of responsibility, commitment and dedication to the world community. As for Papua New Guinea, recent negative trends and developments have in fact increased the importance which we attach to the United Nations, and strengthened our commitment and dedication to its principles and objectives.
The United Nations Charter commits us to preserving peace and fostering social and economic development. All we Member nations have undertaken to resolve our disputes peacefully and to respect the independence and territorial integrity of all sovereign States. This Organization provides the only universal framework within which we can keep those promises and pursue those vital ideals and goals collectively.
What better year to recommit ourselves to the united Nations than this year - the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. It is not going to be easy, but it can be done, and do it we must. We cannot hope for an equitable and peaceful world if we become complacent about the status quo. We must therefore put behind us our animosities and mistrust towards each other, and unite once more, as the founders did in San Francisco, with the common goal of preserving the United Nations as an instrument for peace and equity. Papua New Guinea believes that we are up to that task, for we are not only forty years older but, hopefully, forty years wiser.
"
525,40,1985,VUT,"The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations represents a historic milestone for all mankind. This is less, a time for celebration of what we have achieved and more a time for reflection on and rededication to our sometimes forgotten ideals.
Your selection, Sir, to preside over this session of the General Assembly is a well-deserved tribute to your integrity and your diplomatic skills. It is also a tribute to your country, which you have faithfully represented here at the United Nations for so many years. We applaud your selection and the much-deserved honor bestowed upon you and Spain.
We also commend your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Paul Lusaka of Zambia, for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties. All of us were the beneficiaries of his exceptional abilities and his dignified manner. For this, we shall always be grateful.
We are also grateful to the host country and the host city for the manner in which we have been received. Many people have worked very hard to ensure the comfort and safety of the various delegations represented here today. We appreciate the patience, understanding and goodwill of the people of this great nation and this great city. The presence of so many Heads of State or Government here at the same time has not been easy to manage, but all involved have done a commendable job. The general public, representatives of the various city, state and federal agencies, and the members of the united Nations Secretariat have all earned our thanks. I trust that this same teamwork and spirit of co-operation will in the future symbolize the international community's relationship with the City of New York.
The Secretary-General of our Organization has earned a reputation for candor and objectivity. His analytical and thought-provoking annual report enhances that much-deserved reputation. As he has so capably pointed out, the question before us now, as always, is
'not so much the future of the United Nations as the future of humanity and of
our planet and the role of the United Nations in that future'.
(A/40/1, para. 1)
The opening of this session has, in some quarters, generated an almost unprecedented interest in the Organization. The news media and general citizenry of countries which have in recent years been indifferent to the United Nations seem to have a heightened sense of awareness of some of the items on our agenda. Our day-to-day worn still does not capture much of their attention, but at least this session seems to have generated some interest in our work, one might have to go back to the early sixties, or even to the inception of the United Nations, to recall a comparable level of interest.
Unfortunately, interest in an event does not always bring with it knowledge or understanding of the various perspectives on a substantive question. One of the challenges we face is how we can transform the interest in this event, the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the. United Nations, into a broader knowledge of and appreciation for the substantive work of this Organization.
There are cynics who do not believe that the United Nations serves any useful purpose. There are some people who feel that what good the united Nations does is outweighed by waste and inefficiency, divisive political debates and strident rhetoric. There are others who know better, but because the United Nations no longer serves their interests to the extent it once did, they deliberately distort and misrepresent the history of this Organization, and they seldom miss an opportunity to smear its good name.
No legislative body anywhere in the world is without its critics. This is true of legislative bodies in big countries and small, and in new States and older, more-established states which call themselves democracies. Criticism itself is healthy and can be a constructive tool for development and advancement. It can also be a dishonest effort to intimidate rather than reform.
The united Nations is perhaps easier to criticize because, although it has the appearance of a legislative body, it does not have the powers of a legislative body. Those who wish to prolong a political crisis know that the United Nations cannot enforce its will without the co-operation of its Members. Thus, it does not make sense to maintain, as some do, that the United Nations has not been able to solve any of the world's major political problems.
As are all know, and as the Secretary-General has restated,
'The United Nations cannot - and was not intended to - solve all the problems of the international community ...' (A/40/1, para. 9) We created an imperfect Organization. Our own sovereign rights as individual nations limit the scope and effect of our decisions as the United Nations. If we wish to create a stronger Organization - one which has an ability to implement its decisions - it is up to us to do so.
That is not a new theme. Everyone here knows that it is true, even though some do not wish to admit it. On the other hand, all of us know that the united Nations has managed to accomplish a great deal in other, very important areas.
Today, millions of people have homes to live in and food to eat because of the work of the specialized agencies of the united Nations. Millions of people can read and write and see the irreplaceable treasures of their own cultures because of the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Millions of people no longer fear certain diseases because of the work of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Racism and colonialism are no longer acceptable modes of international behavior, thanks in part to the united Nations.
Are not these things that we should all be proud of? Why is it that some among us can take pride only in how many people they are capable of killing or maiming in a few short seconds? Why is it that some among us can take pride only in how many material possessions they have in relation to how few others have? Why is it that some among us can take pride only in competing with nature's ability to destroy rather than with nature's ability to create?
This year, more than ever before. Millions of people are hoping and praying that we, the leaders of the world, will come to our senses and hear what they have been saying. Host people do not want to hear fancy words and unfulfilled proHises. Most people do not want to live in fear and with uncertainty and insecurity. They want us to listen as well as talk to each other. They want us to reason together and devise ways to ensure that this generation leaves a world for the next generation to inherit. They want us to assure then that the stars above us will continue to be for lovers to gaze at, for thinkers to ponder over, and for scientists to explore - but not a place to store the instruments of war.
Every year the opening of the general debate generates a great deal of anxiety and anticipation here at the headquarters building, and in most of our capitals. The first few days of the debate are usually highly charged and full of great expectations. Everyone seems to wait breathlessly for new pronouncements on the problems of the world. This is particularly true when the pronouncements are being made by the larger, more powerful countries, which have the ability to affect those problems. 
As the debate continues, however, and smaller countries take the rostrum, the interest of the opinion-makers seems to flag. They say that the speeches take on a strident and familiar tone. To them, each day seems to be a little bit less dramatic than the one before, and unless a new crisis arises, or a highly visible personality arrives on the scene, they lose interest and direct the public's attention elsewhere.
Thus, when at this historic session the President of Tanzania, Mr. Julius K. Nyerere, addressed the General Assembly for the last time, the public's attention was indeed directed elsewhere. President Nyerere is one of the most respected figures of this century. His has always been an articulate and reasonable voice for the discriminated against, the disadvantaged, and the disenfranchised of this world. We of the developing countries treasure him as one of our elder statesmen. We shall miss him hers at the General Assembly.
I know that I speak for many others when I applaud his words and say that his last address deserved far better coverage by the news media, what more persuasive evidence can be presented on behalf of the need for a new international information order?
Ironically* while this historic session marked Mwalimu's last address to us as President of Tanzania, it also marked the first address to the General Assembly by one of the developing world's younger statesmen, Mr. Alan Garcia, President of Peru. The symbolism of this coincidence should be noted.
(toe is a son of Africa, the other is a son of South America. Both of them spoke for others as well as the people of their native lands, and both belong to us all. Both had the courage and conviction to address difficult subjects with imagination and originality. Both electrified this hall when they spoke.
I cite these two addresses as examples of the careful thought and analysis every nation has brought to this session.
Mr. Jose Sarney, President of Brazil, set the tone for us with his stimulating opening address. Each successive speaker has placed his own unique signature on our dialog. He only hope that the message is being received and will be given careful consideration.
Who better to remind us of the very nature of our international democracy, and of our responsibility vigorously to oppose the apartheid regime of south Africa than President Nyerere? Who better to illustrate to us the perils of the illicit drug trade, addictive monetary policies, and an equally addictive arms race than President Garcia, representing a small developing country whose democracy is threatened by all three?
Vanuatu is, as members of the Assembly are aware, a very small developing country situated in a region that some delegates might not often think of as they ponder the great issues of the day. There are, however, some facts about our region that should be borne in mind, particularly on this, the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.
In 1945 most of the current Members of this international community were colonies. Our region was no exception. Our people were exploited, undereducated and socially segregated in our own land, as were most colonized peoples. Although we ourselves were not among the rich and powerful of this earth, our region was fiercely contested during the Second World War. Veterans of that fighting insist that it was the most. intense of any combat anywhere in the world.
One of the nations of our region had, on a per capita basis, the highest number of men in uniform, the highest number of men in combat overseas, and the highest number of casualties. When the United Nations was formed, this nation and another frost our region were considered by sons to be the spokesmen for the small countries, the reason being, of course, that other smaller countries were still colonies.
We ourselves, although still a colony during the war, remained loyal to the allied cause when one of our colonizers was occupied by the forces of fascism and the Vichy government established. When that country was liberated by allied forces we shared in the joy of its people, even though we ourselves were still a colony.
When the war ended, we watched with amazement as millions of dollars worth of material and equipment, some of which we could still use today, was dumped into the ocean or otherwise destroyed. We, of course, did not understand such waste.
We also heard the mighty roar and saw the terrible flashes of nuclear bombs as the land, the seas, and the whole environment of our region were used to test new, more powerful weapons of destruction. Peace had cone, we were told, but our environment knew no peace.
Today, our environment still knows no peace. One of our former colonizers -the same one whose own liberation we fought for and cheered - continues to test its
nuclear weapons in our environment. It tells us that these tests are safe and that we are free to come and inspect the test sites for ourselves. It ignores our moral
objections to nuclear weaponry.
He note that there is no conclusive scientific evidence that these tests are safe. Even if they were, we would still oppose the use of our region for the testing of these weapons. If the tests are so safe, let them be conducted on the land of the testing country. Then there will not even be a need for us to be invited to inspect the test sites.
The nation that continues to test those nuclear weapons in our region is also the nation that continues to Maintain a colonial presence in our region. The two policies go hand in hand.
An independent New Caledonia would not be a support base for nuclear testing in the South Pacific. We doubt that an independent French Polynesia would be the site of nuclear tests.
We are told that these tests and visits to our ports and waters by nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered vessels are necessary to help defend us and our way of life. At this point, we wonder if our would-be defenders even understand our way of life. In our innocence, we have always believed that freedom Beans that the people of a particular society are free to make their own decisions. If we do not wish to be defended with nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels, our wishes should be respected.
Ours is a parliamentary democracy, we follow the will of our people and not the will of others our people never elected. The people of the South Pacific have chosen to reject nuclear weaponry, which we all have a very strong reason to detest. We appeal to those who have it within their power to free our children from the fear of nuclear tests to respect our wishes and to do so. Their failure to do so will not lead us to change our position, but it may lead us to change our belief in their sincerity.
This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. One of the greatest achievements of the united Nations is that the process of decolonization is now almost completed. The United Nations is now an almost universal international body.
Unfortunately, some do not like that. To them, smaller countries such as ours should be seen - primarily by tourists - and rarely heard. The sane voices that did not want to extend the right to vote to all of the people in their own countries now decry the spread of international democracy and the right of all nations to have an equal vote in the world body.
We are told that the size of a nation's financial contribution should determine its influence here at the United Nations. This is an interesting proposition that deserves closer examination. Let us not for the moment even examine how and from what and where the wealth of the wealthy nations was created. After all, we must not dwell on the past, what is interesting about the proposition is the fact that by extending the argument we would have a situation where nations that now consider themselves democratic would be encouraged to give greater weight to the votes or opinions of their wealthiest taxpayers. Perhaps some nations do this already. I do not know. This is not, however, our notion of democracy, and it is not what we do in Vanuatu.
Another fact to be considered is that there are different ways to measure contributions to the United Nations. Based on contributions as a proportion of gross national product, Vanuatu is the largest contributor to the operational activities for development of the United Nations system. Should we, therefore, insist that, unless nations vote the way we want, we will reduce our contribution? Should we now demand a weighted voting system in the General Assembly? I think not.
Yes, decolonization has changed the United Nations. We think it is a change for the better. It now more accurately reflects the thinking of most of the world's people. And, after all, is it not true that one of the things we most abhor about apartheid the fact that the Government of South Africa does not reflect the thinking of most of that country's people? If we cannot accept the principle of one nation, one vote here, then how can we champion one person, one vote in South Africa, or elsewhere?
In any event, let us leave those who are troubled by our present democracy to ponder how they night turn back the clock a century. The rest of us have some unfinished business to attend to in this century.
In our region, the people of Hew Caledonia want their independence. The neighboring States of the South Pacific Forum support the right of the people of Hew Caledonia to determine their own future and to be an independent nation. The foreign ministers of the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement also support that right.
To its credit, the administering Power has taken some constructive steps in the process of decolonization, but a great deal more remains to be done, particularly in the face of provocations by extremist elements within the settler population. Those settlers hope that their militancy and their lawlessness can coerce the administering Power into a failure to fulfill its commitment and its duty to facilitate that decolonization process.
In the face of those dangerous provocations New Caledonia's colonized people, the Kanaks, have been remarkably restrained and conciliatory. At the same time they refuse to deviate from the path of self-determination-and independence.
The recent elections held in New Caledonia demonstrated the depth of the feelings of the indigenous people that they be allowed to assert their own identity and reclaim their own country. The elections also showed that the settlers are, at this point, determined to remain French. It is they, and not the colonized people or the administering Power, that have drawn the battle line in Hew Caledonia. It is they, and not the indigenous people or the metropolitan Power, that constitute a clear and present danger to the peace and security of our region. Therefore, it is now time for the United Nations to be seized of this problem and to assist in assuring a peaceful but speedy transition to independence.
What distinguishes New Caledonia from other colonial situations in the south Pacific is a recognition by the administering Power that the status quo cannot continue. The administering Power has not yet made such a clear determination with respect to its other colonies in the South Pacific. However we expect that eventually it will.
Unfortunately there is in our region a disguised colonialism as well. That problem is proving to be much More difficult to. address.
Too many Members of this international community believe that colonialism is an evil policy of European States only. Too many of us do not believe that a third world country that is itself a former colony can be expansionist. None of us want to believe that a country we admire for its anti-colonial past would succumb to the temptation to attempt the annexation of smaller, more vulnerable neighbors. However, this is exactly what has happened in our region, and on more than one occasion, we fear that it might even happen again.
East Timor was never a part of Indonesia and its people were never asked whether they wanted to be Indonesians. If, as Indonesia claims. East Timor's people are happy with the current state of affairs, why is that territory still closed to outside observers, and why does the military resistance of the Maubere people continue?
Fortunately for East Timor's people, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have now been permitted some access to the territory. This access, however, is still very limited and tightly restricted. That there is any access at all is due primarily to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and a bi-partisan group of members of the United States Congress. We commend their efforts, and thank them for acting when others did nothing.
We are encouraged by the negotiations between Portugal, the Administering Power, and Indonesia, the occupying Power. However, we feel that nothing of substance can be negotiated without the participation of the representatives of the people of East Timor.
The situation in Bast Timor is not on the General Assembly's agenda this year, and there will not be a resolution on that subject for us to consider. However, this does not mean that the plight of the people of that country should be forgotten or ignored. Most of the nations represented here will never permit that to occur.
It is true that we have a very long agenda, and each year it seems to grow longer. Some of the problems even appear incapable of resolution, perhaps this is because in some instances in the past, some meters of the international community were unaware of what was happening in other parts of the world. Others simply chose to excuse or ignore the type of abuse which is now occurring in East Timor.
The colonial histories of East Timor and West Papua were different. The political climate at the time that each was annexed was also different, as were the social conditions that existed in each country. However, had enough voices been raised when West Papua's people were denied the right to make their own choice, perhaps the rights of East Timor's people would not have been trampled upon.
By now, iiiJ8t people have forgotten what happened in west Papua. Its people have not. Every day we in that region are ourselves reminded by them. Indonesia wishes we would forget. We wish that we could. However, only Indonesia can make us forget, and not by calling us names, but by permitting those Melanesian people to decide freely for themselves who they are and what they want to be.
We sometimes look at what the earth possesses and wonder why greed and avarice drive some men to treat others as sub-humans. What is it that drives some to fear and despise others because they look different, sound different, or maintain different religious or political beliefs? All over our globe this seems to be the case.
The late W. E. B. DuBois once said:
'The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line ...' He was right, and nowhere is this more evident than in southern Africa.
Long after other societies have come to grips with their own racial contradictions. South Africa continues to believe that every man, woman and child should be judged by the color of his or her skin. Long after other societies have realized that it is not even in their best economic interests to maintain such outdated notions South Africa continues, when it comes to racial attitudes, to live not even in the 19th century, but in the 18th century.
Forty years after the death of Adolf Hitler and the demise of his brand of fascism, his heirs exercise State power in Pretoria and masquerade as a respectable Government. Why do we tolerate this? How can anyone call that State a friend? What do those who call that Government a friend have in common with it? Please tell us; we should like to know.
I will not go any further, not here today. I simply state that my Government is prepared to support army concrete measures that the United Nations may adopt to oppose that illegally constituted and illegally maintained regime. Comprehensive international action is required. Partial or selective measures will not work; They will only permit and encourage South Africa bo export the impact of those measures to those front-line States it holds as economic hostage. Disengagement from South Africa must be followed by comprehensive constructive involvement with the front-line States and those south Africans who are trying to free their country.
Some may wonder why Vanuatu, a small country in the South Pacific, is so passionate on the subject of South Africa. Those who wonder do not know much about our own history. Although we are far removed geographically from the centers of world conflict, we are not an island unto ourselves. In the 19th century, our country was depopulated by slave traders who took many of our own people to work for them in other countries. Our country was also depopulated by the purposeful introduction of diseases from which we had no immunity.
In a relatively short period of time our population was reduced from over 1 million people to considerably fewer than 100,000. He knew genocide before the world knew the word.
That is why we will never accept any form of racism no matter what it is called. That is why we join with others who express the hope that just a portion of the massive sums of money spent on armaments could instead be spent on research on cancer, heart disease, sickle-cell anemia and the newest deadly killer, AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). That is. why we associate ourselves with those who have spoken out so forcefully against the illicit production, transportation and consumption of drugs. The drug traffic is to us the new slave trade, turning so many promising youths into useless, but dangerous, zombies.
Even though we are geographically far removed from the major population centers of the world, we know how far and how fast a deadly disease can spread. He know how quickly organized crime can corrupt any society and erode the sovereignty of its people.
Our region is one which is very susceptible to earthquakes and hurricanes. He ourselves suffered the crippling effects of a severe hurricane earlier this year. It caused considerable damage to our economy. He are now recovering slowly but surely. Host of bur neighbors have also been victimized by very bad hurricanes in the last few years, particularly Fiji. Thus, we understand the suffering of the people of Mexico; we comprehend the full nature of their tragedy, and we mourn with them.
Developing countries are always more vulnerable to natural disasters because our economies are more fragile. He have fewer resources to begin with and therefore less to call on when these disasters strike. The disaster relief assistance of the developed world is always welcome and appreciated. However, we often wonder why it takes a disaster to mobilize massive international aid and co-operation.
How many people would have been saved in Africa, and for how much less money, if proper development assistance had been provided beforehand and effectively directed? How many more calamities can we avert in the future by taking a long, hard look today at the economic practices which lead to unequal levels of development and weak national infrastructures? Is it not better for us to sit down together now and plan for the future than merely to wait to react to the next disaster?
International co-operation must in the near future become much more than a phrase or slogan. The future well-being of this planet demands that we pull together. The United nations may not be perfect, but it is all that we have. It is up to us, all of us, to make the next 40 years better than the first 40.
One area we can start in is that of the law of the sea. The almost limitless resources of the sea-bed give us an opportunity to demonstrate that mankind is not by nature selfish. There is plenty for everyone, and there is an international treaty that recognizes and codifies that fact.
Why then have some chosen to act separately? What is there to gain? The rest of us have demonstrated our willingness to negotiate and assign importance to their capital and their technology. What else can we do? What else do they want us to do? We hope that reason will prevail and that before long the entire community of nations will sign in this painstakingly negotiated and drafted Convention and work within its confines to make it a success.
As a developing small island State  in the South Pacific, we have a great deal at stake in that treaty, as in all other forms of International co-operation. Thus, we welcome the negotiations towards concluding a multilateral access treaty between the States of our region and the United States. He hope that the resulting regime will lead to a more equitable arrangement for the development of fisheries in our region. He will, however, always be faithful to the long-tern development needs of our own people and to our international commitments.
The United Nations is a young Organization and most of its Members are young States. He are one of its youngest. The concept of international democracy is itself young, and still developing. Occasionally, the international community may even make mistakes, but that is one of the costs of democracy. Consider the alternative. Reflect back to what we left behind only 40 short years ago.
He have come a long way, and we have a lot further to go, but we can only make the journey together - all of us, large and small, developed and developing. North and South, East and west.
Debate and disagreement are healthy and will help us on our journey so long as we maintain an ability to engage in dialog and to respect each other's points of view. It is wrong to try to judge us by whether or not we always agree with each other or with any one of the Members. After ail, who is to say that any one of the Members is the one that is always right?
Families do not always agree, and we are a family of nations. However, there are a few items on our agenda about which we are all in agreement. Let us give our Organization a birthday gift of our collective resolve to support our Secretary-General in his efforts to move those items forward.
Let us welcome Namibia to our ranks as an independent State. Let us end apartheid once and for all. Let us engage in meaningful global negotiations. Let us commit our resources to the elimination, of poverty, illiteracy and disease. Let us convene a global conference on drug trafficking and drug abuse, as proposed by the Secretary-General. Let us support the Contadora process. Let us stop building weapons of mass destruction. Let us pledge not to destroy the world before the next generation has a change to make it a better world. Finally, let us work to strengthen rather than undermine the United Nations.
"
572,63,2008,NZL,"Sixty-three years 
after its formation, the United Nations remains the 
world’s central international body. Only here do all 
countries come together to devise solutions and to 
forge collective action on global challenges. And these 
are particularly challenging times. As the Secretary-
General and many others have noted, we are facing a 
global financial crisis, a global energy crisis and a 
global food crisis. More than ever before, we are an 
interconnected and interdependent world community. 
The Charter goals of peace and prosperity require the 
full support of all United Nations Members. New 
Zealand was a founding member in 1945, and our 
commitment to this body is as strong now as it was 
then. 
 At such a difficult time in the world we need 
leadership, courage and a recommitment of our 
resources to tackle the issues before us. When the food 
crisis was first in the headlines, the Secretary-
General’s High-Level Task Force provided a 
mechanism for us all to respond. Having contributed 
nearly $NZ 10 million to date, New Zealand is among 
those assisting with urgent food security needs and 
medium-term policy responses. A successful 
conclusion of the Doha Development Round would 
alleviate much of the pressure on the demand-supply 
imbalance. 
 On the development theme of this sixty-third 
session, New Zealand fully associates with the 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Global Call to 
Action Campaign. Support is urgently needed to 
revitalize collective efforts, including developing and 
strengthening partnerships between traditional and new 
donors, the private sector and civil society, and through 
South-South cooperation. We are set to play our part. 
 New Zealand is significantly stepping up official 
development assistance (ODA) from 0.27 per cent of 
gross national income in 2007 to 0.35 per cent by 
2010-2011. That 62 per cent increase will take New 
Zealand aid to over $NZ 600 million. 
 We are acutely aware that the Pacific is the 
second region after sub-Saharan Africa that is least 
likely to meet the MDG targets. We are therefore 
looking to direct our increased ODA there, through a 
Pacific strategy, which focuses poverty reduction 
efforts around four key pillars: strengthening 
governance, achieving broader-based growth and 
sustainable livelihoods, improving health and 
education, and reducing vulnerabilities, including to 
climate change. 
 In these challenging times, we look to the United 
Nations to deliver effectively for development, for 
peace and security and on human rights. Our 
Organization must continue to evolve along with the 
changing demands on it. Momentum needs to be 
maintained in the modernization of the United Nations. 
We share the Secretary-General’s vision for that and 
support his proposals to fix the human resources 
management system, which he has characterized as 
dysfunctional. 
 I would now like to turn to the challenges of 
peace and security around the world, from which our 
own region is not immune. At the Pacific Islands 
Forum held in Niue last month, New Zealand and other 
members of the Pacific Forum community expressed 
profound disappointment at Fiji’s lack of progress 
towards restoring democratic government. The Forum 
communiqué urged the interim regime in Fiji to fulfil 
  
 
08-53141 26 
 
its promise to hold elections in accordance with Fiji’s 
existing constitution by March next year. Leaders also 
acknowledged that there were long-term issues to be 
resolved in Fiji and supported a Commonwealth-led 
independent and inclusive political dialogue process to 
address them. That will not only create a more 
conducive environment for elections, but also enable a 
newly elected Government to engage with key 
stakeholders to promote national reconciliation. New 
Zealand urges all United Nations Members to support 
the steps taken by the Pacific Islands Forum to 
encourage Fiji to return to democratic and 
constitutional government as soon as possible. 
Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda), Vice-President, took 
the Chair. 
 Our region is also home to Timor-Leste, a partner 
and friend of New Zealand. We are pleased to see 
encouraging progress since last year’s elections, 
especially the building of institutions and improving 
governance. That was achieved despite assassination 
attempts on Timor-Leste’s leadership. The United 
Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) 
and the International Stabilization Force continue to 
play a valuable role in helping to maintain security. 
New Zealand strongly supports the UNMIT mandate 
and its extension beyond February 2009. Planning for 
security in the longer term, to ensure appropriately 
sized and resourced institutions with clearly delineated 
roles and responsibilities, is also a key issue, and we 
stand ready to help. 
 Also within our region, the political, economic 
and human rights situation in Myanmar remains 
troubling. We urge the Myanmar authorities to achieve 
national reconciliation through open and constructive 
dialogue and to respect universal human rights in the 
country, consistent with international obligations. We 
support the efforts of the United Nations to sustain a 
dialogue with the Myanmar Government in order to 
build foundations for the future. 
 On the African continent, the humanitarian 
disaster caused by the conflict in Darfur is 
unacceptable. The targeting of civilians by State and 
non-State parties, is a flagrant breach of international 
human rights law. The widespread absence of justice 
and accountability for such human rights violations and 
the impunity that this promotes represent major 
obstacles to improving the human rights situation in 
Darfur. 
 In the case of Zimbabwe, the recent 
announcement of a power-sharing agreement offers 
hope that the long period of violent repression and 
human rights abuses by the previous Government can 
be brought to a close. The international community 
will be watching closely to see that all parties fulfil the 
commitments that they have made to bring about 
peace, respect for political freedom and human rights 
and a Government which reflects the will of the 
people. 
 Let me turn now to the Middle East. New 
Zealand continues to be strongly supportive of all 
attempts to find a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. We share the international community’s vision 
for a viable and territorially contiguous Palestinian 
State, existing side by side in peace and security with 
the State of Israel. 
 In Afghanistan, despite political progress, the 
overall situation is fragile. The international 
community needs to devote more resources to ending 
the conflict and to assisting the people of Afghanistan 
in their efforts to stabilize and rebuild their country. 
New Zealand has expressed a strong commitment to 
restoring peace and security in Afghanistan with our 
assistance, both military and developmental, totalling 
more than 160 million New Zealand dollars to date. 
 Closer to home, New Zealand welcomes the 
recent improvement in cross-Strait relations. Cross-
Strait stability is vital to the security of the greater 
Asia-Pacific region. We encourage China and Taiwan 
to maintain the dialogue which has been established. 
 New Zealand remains a strong supporter of 
efforts to protect and maintain the international rule of 
law. To that end, one of the most significant advances 
in recent times has been the establishment of the 
International Criminal Court (ICC). When the ICC was 
first established, it was widely considered to herald the 
beginning of a new era in international criminal justice. 
The Court has now reached a crucial stage in its 
development, and it has become clear that the 
establishment of a global justice system brings with it 
many challenges. It is of the utmost importance that 
States rise to those challenges. To fail to do so would 
be a betrayal of the victims of egregious crimes. New 
Zealand urges States to make every effort to ensure the 
independence and success of the Court. The Court 
needs our full support and cooperation to ensure that 
individuals responsible for the most serious violations 
 
 
27 08-53141 
 
of international law are brought to justice without 
delay. 
 In this sixtieth anniversary year of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, we acknowledge the 
many international human rights conventions that have 
arisen out of that unique statement of overriding 
principles. New Zealand played an active part in the 
design of the new Human Rights Council, and we are 
seeking election to the Council next year, so as to be 
more closely involved in its work. 
 The newest member of the family of human 
rights treaties is the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, which New Zealand ratified 
this month. We look forward to the first conference of 
States parties, and to the opportunity the Convention 
offers to make a real improvement in the lives and 
human rights of disabled people everywhere. 
 Finally, let me reiterate the importance that New 
Zealand attaches to the concept of the responsibility to 
protect. The United Nations, through the Security 
Council, should be prepared to protect people against 
ethnic cleansing, genocide, war crimes and crimes 
against humanity when national authorities fail to do 
so. There is a clear need to enhance early warning 
systems to enable the Council to act in a timely 
manner. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-
General on the responsibility to protect, and we stand 
ready to help to take that important initiative forward. 
 As we look forward to the year ahead, New 
Zealand pledges to work actively with others in our 
collective stewardship of the United Nations. We shall 
play our part in the continuing, patient process of 
renewing our Organization and of making it more 
resilient and responsive. "
576,63,2008,PLW,"On behalf of President Tommy 
E. Remengesau, Jr., and the people of Palau, I offer my 
congratulations to the President on his election. I 
assure him and all Member States that the United 
Nations will have my Government’s full cooperation 
and support in the coming year. 
 Our existential challenge is climate change. To 
quote the text prepared for the President’s address at 
the opening of this session, we “cannot accept, under 
any circumstance, proposals for mandatory emissions 
reduction targets that take for granted sacrificing the 
homelands of entire peoples”. We must reach an 
agreement on a set of quantified emission reduction 
targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol. These targets must reflect the urgency of the 
circumstances.  
 The post-2012 regime must address mitigating 
the impacts of climate change on small island 
developing States. As the text of the President’s 
opening address states, Member States “must be guided 
by a single consideration: saving those small island 
States that today live in danger of disappearing entirely 
as nations”. Never before in all history has the 
disappearance of whole nations been such a real 
possibility. As we noted in Niue, Palau and the 
members of the Pacific Islands Forum are deeply 
concerned about the growing threat that climate change 
poses not only to our sustainable development, but in 
fact to our future survival. This is a security matter that 
has gone unaddressed. 
  
 
08-51845 30 
 
 It is for this reason that the Pacific Small Island 
Developing States submitted a draft resolution at the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly 
requesting that the Security Council honour the Charter 
of the United Nations and actively continue its 
consideration of the security implications of climate 
change. We were gratified by the positive response 
from the international community and thank our many 
co-sponsors for their support. We will reintroduce our 
resolution in the sixty-third session and look forward to 
Assembly action this fall. 
 In the meantime, we cannot wait. While Palau 
contributes little to greenhouse gas emissions, we are 
taking significant steps to reduce our reliance on fossil 
fuel, despite the detrimental economic consequences to 
us. The number of projects on energy efficiency and 
renewable energy has been increased, and we thank our 
donor partners for their support. We appreciate the 
support of Italy and Austria in supporting development 
cooperation with respect to energy for sustainable 
development. We also thank the European Union for 
their ongoing assistance in the area of renewable 
energy. 
 We sincerely hope that Taiwan will be able to 
participate in the specialized agencies of the United 
Nations. The Republic of China’s meaningful 
participation in those agencies, such as the World 
Health Organization and the International Civil 
Aviation Organization, would help promote peace and 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance 
important dialogue and help all peoples. 
 The oceans that surround Palau are the backbone 
of our nation’s existence and are integral to our 
continued viability as an independent nation. At the 
sixty-first session we banded together to protect 
vulnerable marine ecosystems from deep sea bottom 
trawling, a destructive fishing practice responsible for 
95 per cent of the worldwide damage to seamounts. We 
congratulate the South Pacific Regional Fisheries 
Management Organisation for adopting interim 
measures that are a substantial step towards eliminating 
bottom trawling. We urge all other regional fisheries 
management organizations and flag States to follow 
this example, and we remind everyone that the 
deadline to take action, 31 December 2008, is fast 
approaching. 
 Palau has been active on the issue of bottom 
trawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. 
The North Pacific is home to some of the world’s best 
remaining fisheries. Their diversity is a key reason for 
the Micronesia Challenge, whereby the countries and 
territories of Micronesia joined together to conserve 30 
per cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per cent 
of land resources by the year 2020.  
 This project is the first of its kind in the world. It 
covers 6.7 million square miles of ocean and helps to 
protect 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs, including 
more than 60 threatened species. We thank the General 
Assembly for its recognition of this programme at its 
sixty-second session, in resolution 62/215 on oceans 
and law of the sea and thank our development partners, 
including Turkey, the Global Environment Fund, the 
Nature Conservancy and Conservation International for 
their support. 
 Since Palau joined the United Nations in 1994, 
we have highlighted our concern that the Organization 
has no presence in our country. We were pleased 
therefore when the United Nations Development 
Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and 
the United Nations Children’s Fund announced that 
eight new joint offices would open in Pacific island 
countries, including Palau. We welcome that historic 
accomplishment and await the opening ceremony. 
 Palau is an active participant in the efforts of the 
international community to combat terrorism and has 
made every effort to improve its anti-terrorism 
capacity. We have met with the Counter-Terrorism 
Committee Executive Directorate to advance our 
requests for assistance, particularly in the area of 
combating money-laundering and terrorism financing. 
Unfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been 
insufficient. Our experience has been that the capacity-
building efforts of the United Nations have focused on 
helping countries draft and adopt legislation. That is an 
excellent first step, but an insufficient one, as the best-
designed legislation is meaningless without 
enforcement.  
 We hope that, during the sixty-third session of the 
General Assembly, the United Nations will take the 
next step and help smaller countries that have the drive 
but not the means to operationalize the laws and 
regulations they have in place to fight terrorism. We 
urge the establishment of a voluntary trust fund that 
would allow small States to develop effective counter-
terrorism initiatives. We thank the United States and 
 
 
31 08-51845 
 
Australia for the counter-terrorism assistance they have 
given us. 
 Urgent attention should be paid to Security 
Council reform. Without it, there can be no genuine 
United Nations reform. Japan has demonstrated its 
concern for and commitment to Palau and all its Pacific 
neighbours, and should be a permanent member of the 
Council. Likewise, India, the world’s largest 
democracy, is a developing nation with a deep sense of 
involvement in Palau and the rest of the Pacific. We 
have supported and continue to support the principles 
of the draft resolution proposed by the Group of Four 
countries. 
 We have worked very hard to change the dates for 
submission to the Commission on the Limits of the 
Continental Shelf. The new submission regime will 
allow developing countries to preserve our claims to 
the resources contained in our extended continental 
shelf. Though that extension of time for submission is 
welcome, it is only half the battle. We still need the 
resources and the technical expertise necessary to make 
a full submission, and we request the assistance of the 
international community in helping us to achieve that 
goal. 
 Palau was the last country to emerge from the 
United Nations trusteeship system. The United Nations 
helped to return our sovereignty after four colonial 
administrations. We are thus particularly proud to 
advance the objectives of this unique institution and 
look forward to working together to achieve them 
during this session of the General Assembly. In 
closing, let me thank the Assembly in my country’s 
native language: Kom Kmal Mesulang."
621,63,2008,VUT,"It gives me extreme pleasure 
to extend my congratulations to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto 
Brockmann on his election. I read with keen interest 
the United Nations news report of His Excellency’s 
election as President of the General Assembly at its 
sixty-third session. I note well what he said on 4 June 
this year, following his election (see A/62/PV.99): for 
  
 
08-52272 6 
 
the United Nations to be more effective, it must be 
what its name implies — an organization of nations 
united, not nations dispersed or, even worse, 
subjugated. Our nations must be united in the struggle 
to democratize the United Nations, united in their 
determination to preserve the world for the sake of 
present and future generations from the scourge of war 
among Member States, and from acts of aggression.  
 I congratulate him and the Vice-Presidents on 
their election to lead the General Assembly. I believe 
that Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann’s election, as a leader in 
his own right, as a Christian priest and as a God-
fearing servant of the Republic of Nicaragua, to the 
presidency of the Assembly is timely in these 
challenging days. 
 May I also extend my appreciation to His 
Excellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful leadership 
of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. 
 I am deeply honoured to be the first President of 
the Republic of Vanuatu to address this Assembly, 
since it is the first time that a Head of State of Vanuatu 
has attended the United Nations since our admission to 
the Organization in 1981. In this respect, please allow 
me also to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-
General on his appointment and on his keen 
commitment to revitalizing the United Nations. 
 I am humbled and privileged to stand before the 
sixty-third General Assembly to share some words and 
thoughts on behalf of the people of Vanuatu. Twenty-
seven years ago, on 15 September 1981, Vanuatu 
became the 155th Member of the United Nations 
family. On that same day, our first and longest-serving 
Prime Minister and the founding father of our nation — 
the late doctor, chief and priest, Father Walter Hadye 
Lini — spoke to the Assembly in the name of the 
people of Vanuatu, with pride, humility and gratitude. 
He acknowledged the support of the United Nations 
through the active concern and assistance of the 
Special Committee of 24 on Decolonization.  
 Father Lini said that, because of that, the United 
Nations has a very special place in the affections and 
esteem of the people of Vanuatu. He also expressed our 
nation’s debt of gratitude to a great number of the 
countries represented in the Assembly, which assisted 
our nation’s difficult progress towards independence. 
 In the same spirit I call on the United Nations to 
continue to pursue the interests of those countries and 
peoples that continue their struggle for freedom and to 
win a permanent place among us. The United Nations 
is the Organization of the family of independent 
sovereign nations and peoples of the world. It must 
stand firm to promote peace, security and equality 
throughout the world.  
 The world’s majority has accepted the 
phenomenon of climate change as a reality and no 
longer an academic theory. From Kyoto to Bali, that 
observation has been consistently repeated. 
 The increase in the occurrence of natural 
calamities and their destructive powers are a stark 
reminder of the increasing vulnerability of today’s 
global environment, where nature respects no 
boundaries. The severe impact of natural disasters will 
constantly remind us of the harsh experiences and 
critical development challenges confronting many of 
the island countries. 
 I join my colleagues from the Pacific region in 
our call to the international community for more 
concerted action in addressing climate change as a 
security issue. Unless the present trend of global 
warming is reversed through sincere and concerted 
international action through the United Nations 
framework, some of our Pacific colleague nations will 
be submerged. If such a tragedy should happen, then 
the United Nations and its members will have failed in 
their first and most basic duty to a Member and its 
innocent people, as stated in Article 1 of the Charter of 
the United Nations. 
 In 2003, Vanuatu’s economic growth rebounded 
to 3.2 per cent from -2.6 per cent and -7.4 per cent in 
2001 and 2002 respectively. Continued growth was 
recorded in 2004 and 2005, with a published growth 
rate of 5.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively, 
driven mainly by growth in the service sector and, in 
particular, tourism. 
 As members know, a dimension of the least 
developed country (LDC) status is the tri-annual 
review by the Economic and Social Council of the list 
of least developed countries with the view to 
recommending countries for graduation out of or 
inclusion in the group of least developed countries. It 
is in that regard that I wish to bring to the attention of 
our Assembly to an area of serious concern to the 
Governments of Vanuatu and of several other small 
island developing States of the Pacific.

 It is our view that the current graduation rule 
poses a systemic issue that could easily be resolved if 
Member States were willing to recognize its 
importance to countries such as Vanuatu and other 
Pacific nations. The decision to graduate a country 
from LDC status, in our view, must imply the 
recognition of undisputed sustainable socio-economic 
progress in the country. The criteria the United Nations 
relies on to arrive at a decision are by and large sound 
and fair, and I will briefly recall them: first, one 
expects the country to enjoy a higher income per 
capita; secondly, the country’s human assets or human 
capital is expected to have made significant progress; 
and thirdly, the country ought to have achieved greater 
resilience to external shocks — in other words, to have 
become less vulnerable economically. 
 A country is recommended for graduation if it 
meets any two of those three criteria. In other words, 
the graduation rule implicitly postulates that all three 
criteria are equally important. If a country, no matter 
how vulnerable, has risen to a level of per capita 
income above $900, which is not difficult in a small 
State, and enjoys improved human capital, it is 
assumed that that country has become structurally 
stronger and is now ready to pursue its development 
efforts without LDC treatment. 
 Vanuatu and other Pacific countries believe it is 
critical to recognize the vulnerability criterion as the 
paramount criterion and accordingly give it 
prominence. It is indeed the only criterion that 
ultimately matters to small and vulnerable States such 
as ours. 
 Vanuatu and other Pacific countries are deemed 
eligible for graduation on the basis of their improved 
per capita income and improved human assets. They 
remain among the most vulnerable countries in the 
world, both economically and environmentally, and 
that must be recognized by the United Nations. Our 
countries may graduate from LDC status because they 
have achieved a higher per capita income performance, 
even though the sustainability of that income is 
constantly challenged by the high vulnerability of 
island economies to shocks such as frequent cyclones, 
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and sea-level rise. 
 The recent hurricanes in this part of the world 
remind us of the destructive impact that such natural 
phenomena have on the development process of island 
countries and LDCs. Members may be aware that the 
“island paradox” — when relative prosperity 
overshadows high vulnerability — continues to be 
disregarded, despite the repeated call for a reform of 
the graduation rule that would make low vulnerability 
a sine qua non or compulsory criterion. 
 This is not the first time that Vanuatu, in 
addressing the Assembly, has called on the United 
Nations to reform the way least developed countries 
are identified. Some 11 years ago, in 1997, a former 
Prime Minister called for an urgent review of the LDC 
graduation criteria, which brought the United Nations 
to introduce a vulnerability criterion, a fair and sound 
move on the part of the Organization. 
 I reiterate Vanuatu’s plea for a reform of the 
graduation rule and wish to point out that the reform 
we are calling for is a mild and reasonable one, one 
that could easily be adopted by the Economic and 
Social Council and the General Assembly without 
altering the main components of the established 
methodology. We believe the time has come for the 
United Nations to come full circle by making the same 
criterion a superior one, so that no highly vulnerable 
country is forcibly reclassified and bound to lose the 
level of concessionary support of which it remains in 
need. Such a reform would do justice to countries that 
have not achieved the implied structural progress. 
 We are also urging experts from the Committee 
for Development Policy to seriously consider the merit 
of undertaking in-country visits to assess first-hand the 
development experiences of affected countries rather 
than making conclusions on statistical indicators that 
are anomalous and theoretical. 
 In 2004, the Government of Vanuatu established 
its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) National 
Committee, which adopted a plan of action to 
implement the MDGs. In its first report, in 2005, the 
MDG National Committee concluded that Vanuatu’s 
outlook for the achievement of the MDGs or their 
respective targets was poor to fair. That can be 
attributed to poor linkages to Government priorities 
and inadequate allocation of resources to implement 
the plan of action.  
 Nevertheless, we are pleased to report that in 
collaboration with the United Nations Development 
Programme, Vanuatu is endeavouring to put in place 
mechanisms to operationalize its sector strategies by 
identifying key issues and the  required interventions to 
address them, and defining the coverage of 
  
 
08-52272 8 
 
interventions and their costing. We believe that, if we 
succeed in doing that, we will be able to accelerate 
progress on the MDGs and that, come 2015, Vanuatu 
will be able to provide a more positive report to the 
Assembly. 
 At the Millennium Summit, the then Prime 
Minister of Vanuatu, The Honourable Barak Sope 
Maautamate, called on the United Nations to review 
the legality of the United Nations action in 1962 to 
endorse the New York Agreement to administer the  
so-called Act of Free Choice over West Papua. 
 The Charter of the United Nations espouses the 
principles that continue to guide the Organization’s 
efforts in the process of self-determination. That 
manifestation calls for recognition and respect for the 
fundamental and inalienable rights of peoples and 
territories still under colonial rule to determine their 
future. We cannot champion democracy if the United 
Nations continues to hang this blanket of silence over 
the case of West Papua, in which the United Nations 
itself takes part. 
 An issue of extreme national importance is the 
question of submissions to the United Nations on the 
extension of continental shelves. As with some other 
smaller nations, technical capacity constraints and 
financial resources have inhibited our progress on 
submissions, and therefore we are requesting that the 
United Nations consider extending the deadline for 
submissions to enable countries like Vanuatu to 
participate fully in the process. We call for the 
understanding of our development partners and urge 
them to consider providing funding for that important 
exercise. 
 A side issue to the question of the extension of 
continental shelves in relation to Vanuatu is that there 
is a dispute between Vanuatu and the French Republic, 
the former colonial authority, concerning our 
continental shelves to the south of the nation.  
 On the question of reforms at the United Nations, 
we believe that, in order to make the Organization truly 
democratic, reforms are essential to make the Security 
Council more representative of the membership as a 
whole. In that respect, we believe that Japan and India 
deserve permanent membership. 
 At this critical moment of global crisis, I recall 
the aphorism underpinning the foundations of the 
United Nations. It is taken from the book of the great 
prophet Micah and is engraved on the walls of United 
Nations Headquarters: 
  “They shall beat their swords into 
ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. 
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, 
neither shall they learn war any more” (The Holy 
Bible, Micah, 4:3). 
 It is no coincidence that the theme for this 
Assembly is a much clearer manifestation of those 
prophetic words, which the United Nations has 
neglected over the years. As one of the smallest 
Members of the United Nations family of nations, 
Vanuatu reaffirms its commitment to building global 
peace and security. We also remain committed to 
supporting United Nations peacekeeping missions as 
our modest contribution to that worthy cause. 
 Finally, we welcome 2009 as the International 
Year of Reconciliation. We all hope and pray that it 
will be a time for real compromises and political 
goodwill. We encourage all members of our family of 
nations to approach 2009 with open hearts. If we are to 
turn the tide of tension and animosity, we must have 
the courage to reconcile our differences and come 
together in those dimensions that will enhance this 
noble Organization’s role in peacebuilding and 
development. 
 In closing, I would like to express the 
Government of Vanuatu’s gratitude to all our 
development partners who have generously contributed 
to Vanuatu’s development efforts. In particular, we 
wish to thank Australia, China, the European Union, 
New Zealand, Japan, the United States of America and 
France. We would also like to acknowledge the support 
of other partners, including India, Turkey, South Korea, 
Malaysia, Indonesia and Canada, as well as such 
multilateral institutions as the World Bank and the 
Asian Development Bank, and other United Nations 
agencies. 
 Mr. Baugh (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the 
Chair. 
 We are living in perilous times. In our Father’s 
hands were we created, and to the hands of the leaders 
of the world He has entrusted the responsibility to 
ensure a world safe and just for all His peoples and 
children. The world’s destiny is in our hands. That 
must be our inspiration.

 May God bless the United Nations. May God 
bless the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. 
May God bless us all. "
660,63,2008,AUS,"I would like to 
congratulate Mr. d’Escoto Brockmann on his election 
as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third 
session. The Australian delegation looks forward to 
working closely with him throughout the session. 
 We gather together at a time of great challenge to 
the international system — a challenge that reminds us 
afresh that we live in a world where our 
interdependence is now greater than at any time before, 
an interdependence that therefore demands our 
international cooperation now more than at any time 
before. 
 There are many who criticize the United Nations. 
And those of us who know this institution well know 
that it is not immune to criticism. But those who argue 
against this Organization advance no credible argument 
as to what should replace it. Whatever its 
imperfections, the United Nations represents a 
necessary democracy of States — States who resolved, 
out of the carnage of the last world war, that 
cooperation should always be preferred to conflict, that 
our national interests are invariably best served by the 
simultaneous prosecution of the international interest, 
and that the purposes of our common humanity should 
prevail over the narrow interests of the few. 
 When the nations of the world met in San 
Francisco in 1945, the United Nations was conceived 
as a bold experiment — one that ran contrary to the 
grain of the international order that had preceded it, 
where conflict was the norm and cooperation the 
exception; one in which the international community, 
for the first time, began to imagine how through an 
international institution we could not just protect the 
sovereignty of States, but equally advance the 
protection of peoples and the dignity of individuals. 
 Beyond that, we began to advance the idea that 
through the other great international institutions — the 
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
and the International Labour Organization (ILO) — we 
could fashion an international economic order that 
recognized the unfolding reality of economic 
interdependence.  
 These were the ideals we set for ourselves more 
than half a century ago. And while the history of our 
achievements since then has been mixed, the ideas and 
the ideals on which these institutions were constructed 
nonetheless remain as valid now as they were back 
then. 
 The failures that we have seen in recent times do 
not lie in the institutions alone. The failure lies more in 
the poverty of our political will to animate those 
institutions to discharge the purposes for which they 
were created. And that is our collective responsibility. 
 The global financial crisis of today presents us 
afresh with a critical opportunity to act 
comprehensively and collectively for the long term, 
rather than selectively and separately for the short. In 
the post-war period, the quantum of financial 
institutional failure seen these last weeks has been 
great. The quantum of government intervention in 
financial markets has been significant. The quantum of 
the impact by one market on another has been 
unprecedented. What we have seen in financial markets 
should bring home to us all that the central organizing 
principle of this twenty-first century is interdependence. 
 For the century just past, interdependence may 
have been one option among many. For the century that 
is to come, there is no longer an alternative. 
Interdependence is not the expression of sentimental 
idealism. Instead, it is a recognition of the new realism 
of our current times, which represents the cumulative 
impact of the globalization of our engagement with 
each other over many decades. Through unprecedented 
trade flows, unprecedented investment flows and 
unprecedented financial flows, we now see the 
globalization of our economy; the globalization of 
security, arising from the searing impact of 
11 September when the obscenity visited on this great 
city caused us all to conclude that terrorism was the 
enemy of all civilized humanity, not just of some 
 
 
37 08-51851 
 
nations; and the globalization of the environment, as 
we have come to recognize that carbon emissions from 
one part of the planet affect all parts of the planet and 
therefore radically affect the future of the planet itself. 
 What all these things tell us is this: 
interdependence is the new realism of this twenty-first 
century. And unless as a community of nations we rise 
to this new challenge, our future is bleak indeed. 
 The global financial crisis is a call to the global 
community to act. Financial markets are a public good. 
The stability of global financial markets is a public 
good. If Governments fail to protect this public good, 
then those who suffer are the working people of the 
world, whose jobs, whose homes and whose standard 
of living depend on it. 
 It is Governments rather than speculators that 
have the central responsibility for determining the rules 
that govern the way markets work. A decade ago, the 
global economy and global financial markets were 
buffeted by the Asian financial crisis, and as a global 
community we resolved that we would act to reduce 
the risk of such systemic crises in the future. The 
problem is, a decade on, that systemic lessons were not 
learned. 
 Now we face a financial crisis of truly global 
proportions. We must therefore ask ourselves three 
questions: What went wrong? What needs to be done 
now to fix the problem of financial market instability 
for the long term? And most critically, how do we 
marshal the political will to do so? 
 First, what went wrong? There has been a failure 
of internal governance within financial institutions. 
There has also been a failure of external oversight. 
Regulators have not always recognized the systemic 
risk posed by significant financial institutions. 
 So what must now be done? 
 The immediate task is to rebuild confidence in 
the financial system by ensuring that central banks 
provide adequate liquidity, by enabling the 
recapitalization of critical financial institutions and by 
ensuring their continued solvency. Over the longer 
term, the challenge is to reform financial markets and 
regulatory systems so as to reduce the chances of these 
events repeating themselves in the future. To this end, 
together with other States, we would argue that the 
following reform programme be implemented. 
 First, systemically important financial institutions 
should be licensed to operate in major economies only 
under the condition that they make full disclosure and 
analysis of balance sheet and off-balance sheet 
exposures. Systemically important financial institutions 
are not just commercial banks but can include 
investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds 
and financial clearing houses. 
 Which institutions are systemically important will 
vary in a given country over time. The central bank in 
each country should have responsibility for the 
stability of the financial system. That should be 
embedded in globally agreed best-practice standards 
for financial regulation and should be assessed by the 
IMF.  
 Secondly, we need to ensure that banks and other 
financial institutions build up capital in good times as a 
buffer for bad times, using predictable rules. 
Supervisory frameworks need to be countercyclical, 
not pro-cyclical. The Basel rules need to address this. 
 Thirdly, financial institutions need to have a clear 
incentive to promote responsible behaviour rather than 
unrestrained greed. Regulators should set higher capital 
requirements for financial firms that have executive 
remuneration packages rewarding short-term returns or 
excessive risk taking. Again, the Basel rules need to 
address this. 
 Fourthly, supervisory systems must be compatible 
with accounting principles that reflect reasonable 
assessments of the value of assets over time. We need 
to make sure that accounting rules foster a more 
medium-term perspective and that they do not 
encourage institutions to believe that risk is low merely 
because current asset prices are high or recent asset-
price volatility has been low. The Basel rules also need 
to address this. 
 Fifthly, the IMF should be given a strengthened 
mandate for prudential analysis. Conservative and 
consistent prudential standards should be applied to all 
financial institutions of systemic significance. 
Furthermore, the IMF and the Financial Stability 
Forum should develop early warning systems that 
signal impending institutional vulnerabilities and 
provide advice on remedial policies. Collectively, those 
institutions have led the development of the initiatives 
that represent the core of the financial-market reform 
agenda that I have just described. However, those 
institutions are, by their very nature, bureaucratic, and 
  
 
08-51851 38 
 
the reform processes they initiate are constrained by a 
lack of political authority.  
 That brings me to the third question arising from 
the current crisis: how are we to go about 
implementing this reform agenda for the long term? 
 What is required is political will, exercised 
through ministerial forums working in cooperation 
with the IMF, the Financial Stability Forum and the 
Group of Twenty (G20). The G20 is well placed to 
provide the political authority to have such actions 
implemented urgently and comprehensively. In that 
context, Australia will work intensively with the 
forthcoming Chairs of the G20 — in particular the 
United Kingdom in 2009 — to ensure that financial 
stability is at the centre of the work programme and to 
initiate arrangements to strengthen G20 input into 
shaping the work of the IMF and the Financial Stability 
Forum and the implementation of agreed outcomes. 
 At their meeting in November, the G20 finance 
ministers should review the progress made in adopting 
the current Financial Stability Forum 
recommendations, reinforce the agreed deadlines for 
finalizing their implementation and agree with the 
Forum on a clear timetable for the action plan. 
 As countries with systemically important 
economies, G20 members should demonstrate their 
commitment to best-practice financial regulation and 
disclosure by providing better information regarding 
the stability of their domestic financial systems and 
cross-border exposures to the IMF and the Financial 
Stability Forum. The IMF and the Financial Stability 
Forum should provide regular scenario analysis to the 
G20 to facilitate clear engagement on the risks facing 
the global financial system. Such analysis should be 
included in an enhanced version of the IMF’s Global 
Financial Stability Report. 
 The purpose of this reform agenda is to provide a 
real political mandate for our international regulatory 
institutions to do their job in defending the integrity of 
the international financial system. 
 One of the greatest challenges we face is climate 
change and the threat it poses to the environment. In 
December last year, after many years of delay, 
Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol. We are 
determined to be part of the solution to climate change, 
not just a part of the problem. We have acted to begin 
the process of developing a comprehensive emissions 
trading or carbon pollution reduction scheme to bring 
down carbon dioxide emissions over time. We will also 
implement a national energy efficiency strategy as well 
as a renewable energy strategy. Developing and 
deploying new technologies will also be part of our 
response to climate change. 
 The Australian Government has decided to 
establish a global centre to drive the demonstration and 
commercialization of carbon capture and storage 
technologies. Building on existing national and 
regional initiatives, that project will bring together the 
best researchers in the world to develop the best 
technology to apply. As the world at present is 
planning to generate 45 per cent of its electricity from 
coal by 2030, we can no longer afford to delay acting 
on such technology. Australia invites all Governments 
and corporations of goodwill to participate in the 
Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. 
 The United Nations and we, its Member nations, 
have a responsibility to protect the nations and peoples 
of the world. We must protect people from terrorism, 
and that must include a commitment to support those 
nations on the front lines of the struggle. Australia is 
working closely with the Government of Afghanistan 
and with our global partners to bring security and 
stability to that country. We can never again allow it to 
become a haven for terrorists. 
 Australia is also an active contributor to global 
efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass 
destruction. We continue to urge nations to sign and 
ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty so 
that it can enter into force. 
 We remain concerned that States such as Iran and 
North Korea continue to defy the international 
community and to fail to comply with demands for a 
full declaration and accounting of their nuclear 
programmes. Their actions are undermining the global 
consensus on containment of the spread of nuclear 
weapons. 
 This year, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) celebrates its fortieth 
anniversary. As a middle Power and a long-standing 
member of the NPT, Australia is committed to working 
with other nations towards the goal of the eventual 
abolition of nuclear weapons. Australia, together with 
our close friend and partner Japan, has established an 
International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
and Disarmament to create the political and policy 
 
 
39 08-51851 
 
consensus necessary to elicit a real result on  
non-proliferation and disarmament in advance of the 
2010 NPT Review Conference. 
 The United Nations own security machinery must 
also be effective. The Security Council needs reform. 
Australia supports expansion of its permanent 
membership to reflect changes in the world since 1945, 
and our nation will be a candidate for a non-permanent 
seat for the 2013-2014 term. Australia once again 
wishes to play its part in advancing the international 
security order. 
 Prosperity comes from economic growth. It 
comes from nations trading with one another. That is 
why it is so important that we conclude the Doha 
Round of world trade talks this year. It is why we must 
also implement the Millennium Development Goals, 
consistent with our solemn commitment in this place at 
the dawn of this millennium. 
 Progress in achieving the Goals has been mixed. 
We need to redouble our efforts to reduce poverty, to 
provide education for children and to ensure that 
people in the developing world have access to health 
care. Australia is committed to increasing its official 
development assistance to 0.5 per cent of its gross 
national income by 2015. Australia now resolves to do 
much more — much, much more — to make poverty 
history. It is unforgivable that poverty and conflict, 
such as those in Darfur, continue to claim the lives of 
innocents in the face of inaction by Governments.  
 Development is also about protecting human 
rights. Sixty years ago, this body adopted the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. We must commit afresh 
to protecting the rights that that charter identifies.  
 As nations, we should also commit afresh to 
righting past wrongs. In Australia, we began that 
recently with the first Australians, who have the oldest 
continuing culture in human history. This year, on 
behalf of the Australian Parliament, I offered an 
apology to Indigenous Australians for the wrongs that 
they had suffered in the past. That was the right thing 
for Australia to do. 
 Our membership in the United Nations is a key 
pillar of our foreign policy. Our priorities are regional, 
but our interests are global. We work with partners 
around the world to meet shared challenges. Through 
our membership in the United Nations, we are 
committed to using creative middle-Power diplomacy 
to help overcome the great challenges of our age — 
challenges that are beyond the power of individual 
nation-States to resolve, that can be overcome only 
through unprecedented cooperation between States. 
That is because the problems that we seek to solve in 
this Hall and through the organs of the United Nations 
touch every one of our peoples. To advance prosperity 
and stability at home, we must advance prosperity and 
stability around the globe. 
 Australia was one of the founding Members of 
the United Nations. Our Foreign Minister at the time, 
Herbert Evatt, made a significant contribution at the 
San Francisco Conference, particularly on the part of 
small and medium-sized countries. He ensured that the 
role of the General Assembly was protected in the 
structure of the Organization as a whole. 
 Sixty years ago this week, he was elected 
President of the General Assembly at its third session. 
Evatt was a patriotic Australian. Evatt was equally a 
passionate internationalist. Sixty years later, this 
institution, together with other international institutions 
of our current order, have yet to realize the vision of 
those who founded it. Yet the need today, in this age of 
unprecedented global interdependence, is greater than 
ever before. 
 And so it falls to this generation to now summon 
the political faith and to exercise the political will 
necessary to act for the common purposes of the planet 
we all share. "
676,63,2008,NRU,"I offer my congratulations to 
Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-third 
session. I can assure him that Nauru will lend its full 
cooperation to him as he leads our work during this 
time. Also, allow me to take this opportunity to 
commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Srgjan 
Kerim, for his leadership of the General Assembly at 
its sixty-second session. 
 I wish to reaffirm Nauru’s commitment and 
abiding faith in the ideals and objectives of the United 
Nations. We declare our support for the Organization’s 
efforts to resolve the multiple humanitarian, peace and 
security and development challenges confronting our 
world today. 
 I am grateful for this opportunity to address the 
Assembly for the first time as President of the Republic 
of Nauru. I took the challenge of the office fully 
cognizant of my responsibilities to the people of 
Nauru. Despite knowing that the road to our economic 
recovery will be slow and painful, I have committed 
my Administration to carrying out its duties based on 
the fundamental principles of democracy, good 
governance and sound socio-economic policies. 
 At the beginning of this decade, Nauru was at the 
brink of total economic collapse. Much has been 
achieved to improve our economy and to address the 
resulting social problems. That has been accomplished 
by implementing a range of fiscal, economic and 
governance reforms. I am happy to say that Nauru 
today has stabilized. We are now at the beginning of a 
rebuilding phase in our history. However, I say this 
with a degree of caution and regard for the fragility of 
our situation. 
 
 
19 08-51839 
 
 In order to secure Nauru’s recovery and to ensure 
rebuilding and development, we will need ongoing 
assistance from our development partners. We need 
coordinated assistance targeted at our priorities and in 
line with our strategies so that we may fulfil our 
promise for a better quality of life for my people.  
 Nauru appreciates the financial and material 
assistance from our development partners, in particular 
Australia, Taiwan, Japan, New Zealand and the 
European Union. We appeal for such cooperation to be 
continued in order to strengthen our nation-building 
efforts. 
 Since assuming office, I have been determined 
that Nauru learn from, and not repeat, the mistakes of 
the past. As a consequence of mismanagement and 
corruption, past Administrations took Nauru from what 
then seemed to be a bright future to standing on the 
brink of collapse. In that process, national reserves and 
assets were all lost, and we have been left with an 
unmanageable burden of domestic and external debt. 
Nauru will only ever be able to service a very small 
portion of that debt if we are to ensure ongoing 
recovery and sustained development. We therefore seek 
the understanding and consideration of those countries 
and institutions to which we owe money and appeal to 
them to allow debt forgiveness or major write-downs. 
At the same time, we are implementing financial, 
legislative and constitutional measures to ensure that 
this never happens again. 
 Our limited human resources capacity, relative to 
the enormity of the tasks yet to be accomplished, is a 
further impediment to our development goals. 
Improving the quality of education in our schools, 
promoting trade and skills training, certifying existing 
skills and encouraging ongoing professional and job-
related development are therefore high priorities for 
my Government. Increasing our human resources 
capacity will not only serve to address the risk to 
sustaining our development, but will increase job 
opportunities for my people, domestically and abroad. 
With unemployment overall estimated above 30 per 
cent, and worse among our youth, labour migration and 
the associated remittances must be seen as part of the 
range of measures to secure Nauru’s recovery and 
future. 
 I appeal to all developed countries with major 
workforce requirements to open up their job 
opportunities, reduce barriers to trade in services and 
promote labour mobility. That can contribute far more 
to the development of small States than many other 
traditional forms of aid. Moreover, such measures can 
be targeted at specific sectors and activities, for fixed 
time periods and with certain conditions. The New 
Zealand and Australian unskilled labour schemes for 
Pacific workers are two prime examples. The United 
States military expansion in Guam provides another 
opportunity for significant development assistance to 
the Pacific. We call on the United States for 
preferential access to those opportunities. That will 
require special trade, labour and immigration 
conditions. 
 We need to build our human resources capacity to 
shift Nauru away from its historical reliance on 
government and public sector employment. Likewise, 
we must develop the private sector in Nauru. We 
encourage foreign direct investment, and we welcome 
assistance in developing diversity and new industries in 
Nauru. My Government is focused on creating the 
environment to encourage and facilitate the growth of 
our private sector. 
 Nauru’s recovery and future development are 
particularly vulnerable to external factors. Pacific 
island developing States are greatly exposed to both 
the food and the energy security crises. Dependence on 
imported foods, our remoteness and rising fuel and 
transport costs have made both food and energy 
security particularly critical issues for our region. 
 That is especially true for Nauru. Consider our 
situation: our island home is fringed by a narrow rim, 
where my people live just a couple of metres above sea 
level. The mining of phosphate on Nauru has left large 
pinnacle rocks covering 80 per cent of the island, 
which prevents agriculture and contributes to 
desertification and drought. 
 Although we place a high priority on the 
production of nutritious traditional staples, arable land 
is just too scarce to achieve a sustainable level of food 
security. The Secretary-General stated in his address 
yesterday (see ) that at this time last year rice 
cost $330 a ton and that today it is now $730. Nauru is 
paying nearly double that. Our imported rice costs us 
$1,340 a ton. Rice and other staples are simply 
becoming unaffordable. Without urgent attention to our 
region, it is estimated that an additional 5 per cent of 
our people will slip into poverty because of high food 
prices.

 We need the world to increase food production. 
That requires investment in training and in 
implementing appropriate farming techniques, together 
with efficient seed and fertilizer distribution. We also 
need increased access to food. That includes reviewing 
trade policies on food aid. 
 The energy crisis is anther significant external 
factor that has an impact on our recovery and the 
security of our future. Nauru already cannot afford the 
cost of the fuel required to provide for all its energy 
needs. As a consequence, my people suffer, with 
scheduled power cuts of up to eight or more hours 
every single day. That has an impact on parents’ ability 
to care for and feed their children. Without power, 
houses have no running water, adding to health and 
sanitation problems. Power shedding limits business 
development and impedes government services and 
productivity. 
 The energy crisis is further disproportionately 
impacting Nauru in terms of transport services. Sea, 
land and air, passenger and freight: all are fast 
becoming unaffordable for my people, further isolating 
our island nation and hindering our sustainable 
development. We need urgent assistance, both to 
develop immediate alternative sources of energy and to 
access economically viable sources of fuel. 
 The current reliance on fossil fuels for energy has 
further particular significance for the Pacific small 
island developing States. It has resulted in emissions 
that are causing sea-level rise and climate change. This 
is not scientific theory: we are experiencing the effects 
right now. 
 As with the food crisis, Nauru and the Pacific are 
not contributors to the causes, but we are particularly 
vulnerable. We will pay the highest costs and are the 
first countries to feel the direct consequences. Global 
warming is predicted conservatively to raise sea levels 
by one metre in this century. That will flood our only 
habitable land. Our people will be literally trapped 
between the rising sea and an ancient, uninhabitable 
coral field. 
 Despite our many challenges, we are working 
hard to create a safe and sustainable haven from the 
rising sea. We must rehabilitate our mined phosphate 
lands and return them to a habitable, arable state. The 
cost of rehabilitating 80 per cent of our island is well 
beyond our immediate means. Rehabilitation of the 
island is a high priority, and, as part of climate change 
adaptation, we call for sufficient funding mechanisms, 
including support from the United Nations and 
financial and private sector institutions, to help restore 
our nation and improve our resilience. 
 To address climate change as a world society, we 
need to meet much of our energy needs through 
renewable energy sources, and by reducing emissions 
from fuels and using cleaner fuels. But as critical as 
that is for my nation, it is clear to me that the emitting 
countries have yet to do all they can. We all share the 
same global climate. It is therefore vital that all 
countries give much greater impetus to developing 
alternate energy sources, increase investment and 
implement real measures to address climate change. 
 The issue of climate change for Pacific island 
nations is a threat to international peace and security. 
The preamble to the United Nations Charter stipulates 
that a primary purpose of the United Nations is to 
maintain international peace and security. The Security 
Council is charged with protecting human rights, 
together with ensuring the integrity and security of 
States. It is the paramount international forum 
available to Pacific island countries in which to draw 
attention to the dangers that their islands and 
populations face due to the adverse effects of climate 
change. 
 We do not expect the Security Council to become 
involved in the details of the discussions in the context 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, but we do expect the Security Council 
to keep the matter under continuous review so as to 
ensure that all countries contribute to solving the 
climate change problem and that their efforts match 
their resources and capacities. We also expect that the 
Security Council will review particularly sensitive 
issues such as the implications of the loss of land and 
resources and the displacement of people for 
sovereignty and international legal rights.  
 Nauru has incorporated the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) into its national 
sustainable development strategy. Pacific island 
countries, including Nauru, are struggling in many 
areas of the MDGs as a consequence of the recent fuel 
and food crises and the effects of climate change. 
 We lament the fact that the gap between promise 
and implementation continues to frustrate our 
achievement of the full range of internationally agreed 
development goals that are particularly relevant to 
 
 
21 08-51839 
 
small island developing States. It is extremely 
distressing that those goals were determined by 
consensus of the international community yet 
developed countries have yet to contribute the 0.7 per 
cent of gross national income committed to assist 
developing countries in meeting their targets. 
 On the eve of the high-level event on the 
Millennium Development Goals, may I call on the 
United Nations once more to rededicate itself to 
making development one of the highest priorities of the 
Organization. I would remind the United Nations of its 
commitment to open a total of eight new offices in 
Pacific island countries. We hope that the Organization 
will not waiver in its commitment to support our 
national priorities in meeting the MDGs and provide us 
with the urgently needed international civil servants to 
help with our pursuit of sustainable development and 
poverty alleviation. 
 Sixty-three years after the United Nations was 
founded on the noble ideals of establishing a peaceful, 
free and tolerant global order, the world community 
still suffers from the scourges of war, poverty, 
oppression and discrimination, even as it faces today’s 
colossal global challenges that threaten our very 
existence. If the United Nations is to remain devoted to 
the ideals upon which it was founded, it is absolutely 
critical that it be reformed through the revitalization 
and empowerment of the General Assembly. If the 
United Nations is to remain a defender of human rights 
and international peace, it is crucial that the Security 
Council be expanded to better reflect geo-political 
realities of the modern world. That would mean giving 
permanent seats to Japan, India, Germany and Brazil. 
 If the United Nations prides itself on being an 
inclusive Organization that champions the rights of 
everyone, it cannot continue to deny the fundamental 
right of Taiwan’s 23 million people to participate in the 
specialized agencies of the United Nations. It is clear 
to all of us that cross-Strait relations have been 
improving since May 2008 and that leaders from both 
sides have openly shown a willingness to work 
together to create a positive atmosphere. It is now time 
for the United Nations to find a solution to the 
exclusion of Taiwan. Only by allowing Taiwan to 
participate meaningfully in the specialized agencies of 
the United Nations can the principle of universality and 
democratization of the Organization be fulfilled, and 
regional peace and prosperity ensured. 
 It is very simple and straightforward: we have 
vowed to the people, now let us keep our promise. "
685,63,2008,MHL,"I am honoured and 
privileged to be able to speak in this great Assembly on 
behalf of the people of the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands. 
 I sincerely congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann 
on his election. We have every confidence in his 
wisdom and able leadership to guide us through our 
deliberations. I extend my sincere appreciation to the 
Secretary-General for his leadership and commitment 
to the work of the United Nations. 
 As this body enters its sixty-third year, I am 
moved to express my profound appreciation to those 
visionaries who foresaw the importance of the United 
Nations and took it upon themselves to establish the 
necessary structures for the governance of our 
collective affairs. It is not that the creation of this body 
has led to the cessation of war; it has not. Rather, it is 
that we now have an international forum in which 
nations can talk over and deliberate issues of mutual 
concern. One could well imagine what the alternative 
to talking might be in certain circumstances.

 Like its sister island States in the Pacific region, 
the Marshall Islands is struggling with the 
implementation of its Millennium Development Goals. 
Our effort has been made difficult by unforeseen global 
forces capable of draining every ounce of our 
resources. The Marshall Islands is a small economy 
and inter-island distances are vast, making 
transportation excessively expensive. Formulating 
development strategies that address the new conditions 
has not been easy. 
 An excellent example in this case may be found 
in the current energy crisis arising from the escalation 
in the cost of fossil fuel. Its adverse impact has been 
immediate and severe. The transportation of essential 
goods and the movement of people to and from far-
flung islands have been sharply curtailed. The 
distribution of essential services and food products has 
been acutely impaired, crippling our ability to sustain 
normal public services and posing a particular threat to 
food security and medical services. The rising cost of 
fossil fuels occurring in rapid succession has left the 
Marshall Islands with no choice but to declare a state 
of economic emergency.  
 I am sure, and the International Monetary Fund 
has observed, that at the height of the crisis, when the 
cost of a barrel of oil was over $140, numerous other 
countries were also at the tipping point. 
 As a small island developing State and a member 
of the Pacific Islands Forum, we are now exploring the 
concept of bulk purchasing of petroleum, as endorsed 
by Pacific Forum leaders in Niue last month. Given our 
painful experience, we request that the international 
community give special consideration to the creation of 
a comprehensive financial facility that can help small 
island States to cope in times of crisis. In addition, 
such a facility should also help small island States 
transition from fossil fuel-based energy to affordable 
and renewable energy sources. 
 Our small island States in the Pacific region are 
among the lowest greenhouse gas emitters in the world, 
yet we bear the full brunt of climate change and its 
frightful consequences. The Marshall Islands supports 
international initiatives aimed at stemming the tide of 
climate change. In that context, we endorse the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
the European Union-Pacific declaration; Japan’s Cool 
Earth 50 Programme — which provides funding for 
adaptation and mitigation — and the Niue Declaration 
on Climate Change. 
 In further pursuit of greater guarantees of our 
territorial integrity, the Pacific island countries intend 
to introduce at this sixty-third session of the General 
Assembly a draft resolution calling for climate change 
to be addressed by the Security Council as nothing less 
than a security concern of the utmost serious nature. 
 The litmus test of the international community’s 
commitment to those agreements should be reflected in 
its ability to provide sustainable financing for 
immediate and concrete adaptation programmes on the 
ground in small island States. It is one thing to produce 
agreements or resolutions; it is another to give them 
real meaning in concrete terms. Our commitments must 
show themselves in deeds, not in words alone. 
 On the scale that we have experienced over the 
past few months, the effect of rising fuel costs could 
bring everything to a standstill. Nevertheless, some 
in-country adjustments could be made, however painful 
and agonizing those might be. Insofar as climate 
change is concerned, however, we have no option. We 
can alter neither the size nor the height of our islands. 
They are our natural givens and we are stuck with 
them. Our own very survival is at stake. If sea levels 
rise by two metres, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Kiribati and the 
Marshall Islands will be completely submerged under 
sea. 
 Thus, clearly the only alteration or adjustment 
that is possible is in the mindset and the moral, 
economic and political behaviour of the heaviest 
emitters of greenhouse gas. In summary, nothing is 
more glaring now than the fact that not only are those 
issues interrelated, but that their cross-cutting global 
character clearly demands an effective and immediate 
global response. 
 If wars have been waged to protect the rights of 
people to live in freedom and to safeguard their 
security, why will they not be waged to protect our 
right to survive the onslaught of climate change? Is the 
former more morally imperative than the latter? I urge 
the United Nations to elevate this threat — this 
nightmare — as justification for total war against 
climate change. 
 Recent positive developments, evidenced by the 
easing of tension and the improvement of relations 
between the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan 
 
 
13 08-51845 
 
have begun a new era of good will and hope for 
improved economic possibilities and political stability. 
In the context of those emerging dynamics now 
maturing between China and Taiwan, we see evidence 
of a mutual desire for dialogue and engagement in a 
process that can forge better relations and 
understanding. It is a development worthy of our 
respect, and it presents an excellent opportunity for the 
international community to encourage and strengthen 
that process. 
 In light of that, the Marshall Islands firmly 
believes that the time is now ripe for the 23 million 
people of Taiwan to be accorded full participation in 
the specialized agencies of the United Nations. This is 
a starting benchmark that is consistent with the 
principle of true universality. 
 As we continue to build a United Nations that 
better represents our global diversity, the Marshall 
Islands believes that membership in the Security 
Council should not be guarded as something that is 
overly sacred and untouchable. To do so would be to 
fail to keep in tandem with the principle of change. 
Council membership should instead be enlarged to 
reflect reality.  
 Japan’s fitting aspirations to seek a permanent 
seat on the Security Council deserve favourable 
consideration. Japan is a world economic and industrial 
power, and its leadership and contribution to the 
United Nations is admirable and self-evident. We are 
confident that, as a permanent member of the Security 
Council, Japan will bring much that is good to the 
Council and to the United Nations as a whole. 
 Earlier this month, the United Sates marked the 
seventh anniversary of the tragic loss of lives resulting 
from barbaric acts carried out against the American 
people on 11 September 2001. That event threatened 
our collective security, prompting a response against 
acts of terrorism. 
 It is a matter of personal gratification for me to 
say that, over the past few decades, the special 
relationship between the Marshalls and the United 
States has continued to deepen with encouraging 
outcomes. I am proud to say that, in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, Marshallese young men and women have been 
participating actively in coalition forces as part of the 
United States armed services personnel, demonstrating 
our commitment to shared democratic ideals. 
 I take this opportunity to express our deep 
gratitude to the United States for its continuing 
constructive role in our partnership under the Compact 
of Free Association, as well as for its leadership in 
advancing the cause of freedom around the world. 
 While the ideal of peace envisioned by the 
framers of the Charter of the United Nations 63 years 
ago is yet to be fully achieved, this should not be a 
cause for despair. People of goodwill everywhere have 
expressed their yearning for world peace. Today, we 
see vast increases in movements and organizations 
devoted to humanitarian work, empowerment of 
women and mobilization of youth. We see young and 
older nations engaged in matters of mutual concern. 
The United Nations has demonstrated our collective 
capacity for united action in a wide range of social and 
economic initiatives. It has affirmed our collective will 
to build a better future. 
 I believe the time has come for the United 
Nations to convoke an international convention where 
the fundamental principles and tenets of permanent 
world peace can be deliberated. Such a bold step will 
draw our attention more sharply to our true nature, to 
existing constructive forces and to the need for 
unifying social structures that can foster the 
establishment of a truly new world order, a global 
society animated by principles of social justice. 
 Today nothing is more urgent, more imperative 
and more important for this great institution than the 
establishment of a world peace that is permanent and 
that rests firmly on the bedrock of justice. And as we 
jointly undertake to gradually build that edifice of 
lasting international peace, let us draw our strength and 
take comfort in these words from the Gospel of 
Matthew: “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall 
be called the children of God”. "
686,63,2008,PNG,"On behalf of my 
people and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I 
bring the General Assembly warm greetings and pledge 
our support to you, Mr. President, as you guide us in 
our work. We also wish to thank Mr. Kerim, your 
predecessor, for his strong advocacy during his tenure 
as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-second 
session, especially in the area of climate change. We 
also support Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the 
United Nations in general, especially its agencies, in 
the work they do to enhance our development 
aspirations in Papua New Guinea. As we have always 
done, my Government continues to support the United 
Nations.  
 The United Nations currently provides the world 
forum for Member States to address the many global 
issues we face together. United Nations reforms need 
to be carried out in all the relevant areas of the system. 
We need to address the international gender 
architecture to make it more robust, responsive and 
effective. It has to be part of the core reform process to 
cater for women, youth and children. We must also be 
vigilant against terrorism and threats to international 
peace and security. The One UN system needs to be 
translated more meaningfully in order to effectively 
enhance each Member State’s development priorities. 
 We support the call for the reform of the Security 
Council in both the permanent and non-permanent 
 A/63/PV.13

categories of membership. A number of emerging 
developing countries need to be accorded permanent 
status on the Council to better reflect today’s 
circumstances. We therefore welcome the recent 
consensus to initiate the intergovernmental negotiating 
process to properly address the long-standing but 
critical issue of United Nations reform. 
 We live in a world that provides us many 
opportunities, as well as formidable development 
challenges. The challenges include addressing the 
destructive effects of the illicit use of small arms and 
light weapons and the need to address globalization 
and food and energy security, which lead into the wider 
issue of human security. 
 Additionally, the adverse impacts of climate 
change and global warming continue to threaten the 
existence of many small island States, especially due to 
rising sea levels. For many small island States, sea 
level rise and the adverse impacts of climate change 
are security issues threatening their very survival. We 
therefore call upon the international community to act 
urgently in order to ensure the security and welfare of 
small island developing States. 
 As a thriving democracy in the Pacific, Papua 
New Guinea desires to see our friends and neighbours 
in the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and 
prosperity. In that regard, and consistent with the 
decision of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, 
Papua New Guinea strongly encourages Fiji to restore 
parliamentary democracy by preparing for elections 
and holding them in 2009. However, Fiji must be 
supported throughout, and not isolated in its efforts to 
address its specific national circumstances.  
 On other regional issues, Papua New Guinea 
commends the work done so far on the Pacific Plan for 
Strengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration, 
which we believe may catalyse our region’s 
development. It is Papua New Guinea’s strong view 
that Member States from the Pacific region should be 
categorized separately by the United Nations in terms 
of aggregated data and in the area of social and 
economic classification. While Papua New Guinea is 
ready, we can support Vanuatu’s call for an extension 
to the May 2009 deadline for submissions on an 
extended continental shelf. 
 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
provide us with one of the greatest opportunities to 
leverage our development process. For that reason, we 
commend the Secretary-General for convening the 
high-level meeting on the MDGs during the present 
session of the General Assembly. However, for the 
MDGs to be effectively implemented, they must be 
addressed consistent with national circumstances and 
with host-country leadership. Further, for the MDGs to 
be effective over the long term, developing countries 
must take ownership of the Goals. 
 At the midway point of MDG implementation, for 
Papua New Guinea, we believe there is cause for 
cautious optimism. Papua New Guinea celebrated 
33 years of unbroken constitutional democracy on 
16 September this year. Due to the political stability 
achieved by my Government, we can now afford to 
plan long-term for our own development. We have had 
steady economic growth in the last five years, due to 
prudent economic management that has resulted in five 
successive budget surpluses. 
 Achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
remains an integral development priority for my 
Government. We have set ourselves 15 national targets 
and 67 indicators, which have been integrated into our 
medium-term development strategy and sectoral plans. 
 For example, Papua New Guinea recognizes that 
education is a prerequisite for the betterment of our 
people’s lives. That is entrenched in our constitution 
and prioritized under a 10-year national education plan. 
The current one-laptop-per-child pilot project will 
make learning accessible, enjoyable and fruitful for our 
children, while bridging the digital divide. We are 
looking to expand the project nationwide during the 
Africa Caribbean Pacific-European Union Joint 
Parliamentary Assembly, to be held in Papua New 
Guinea in November. In partnership with UNICEF, we 
have also introduced proactive programmes aimed at 
accelerating the girl-child’s access to education. 
 In the area of health, there remain major 
challenges, such as maternal mortality and HIV/AIDS, 
which the Government is now addressing through the 
10-year national health plan. We have also recorded 
some positive results in other major health indicators, 
including a decrease in malaria incidence and in 
malaria-related deaths, and the stabilization and 
decline of infant and child mortality. 
 Ultimately, reducing poverty, expanding access to 
education and health and empowering women through 
economic and social participation are what we in my 
Government are addressing.

 Millennium Development Goal 8 makes reference 
to partnerships. We strongly believe that Goal is 
critical to the achievement of the other seven. We 
believe, however, that all partnerships must be 
underpinned by mutual respect among the partners. For 
that reason, let me highlight some key partnerships. 
Our partnerships with Australia, New Zealand, the 
European Union, Japan, China, Italy, Austria and many 
non-governmental organizations continue to contribute 
strongly to Papua New Guinea’s development. We also 
partner with the Coral Triangle Initiative on coral reefs, 
fisheries and food security, and the Forest-11 Group, 
launched last year by His Excellency the President of 
Indonesia. Another important partnership is with the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, facilitated by the 
Clinton Foundation, in the area of HIV/AIDS and the 
provision of antiretrovirals. 
 To succeed, we must significantly scale up our 
partnerships. Often, we all tend to wallow in the 
negative — environmental degradation, catastrophic 
climate change, crippling poverty, ineffective 
governance — rather than leveraging the positive. My 
Government’s vision is to transform those societal 
challenges into a framework for environmentally and 
socially sustainable economic growth. It is time to cast 
off policy chains of the past and create a new paradigm 
for the future. 
 Let me be specific. First, we cannot account for 
the environment as an externality. Our natural 
environment and its services are not free to society. 
Once we lose those services, often irreversibly, the 
costs can be significant. 
 Secondly, we must create a broad framework for 
ecosystem service markets. Carbon sequestration must 
only be the first step, followed by valuations for 
biodiversity, water purification, rainfall generation, 
crop pollination and food security.  
 Thirdly, we must now view our natural 
environment as an engine for wealth creation. Those 
valuable ecosystem services must be transformed into 
lasting wealth that supports the rural communities that 
have traditionally cared for those assets. 
 Let me use the issue of reducing deforestation 
and forest degradation — an issue that our Prime 
Minister, Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, has 
championed internationally — as an example. 
Deforestation is a complex subject, but, put simply, it 
is driven by the fact that the world values forests more 
dead than alive. Traditional economic theory, which 
considers ecosystem services a common good and thus 
free to all, is primarily responsible for the massive loss 
of the world’s forests. 
 With those ecosystem services valued at zero, 
rural communities that depend on and care for forests 
must make a living in other ways. Keeping the land 
forested means sacrificing the opportunities to be 
gained by converting it to other uses, such as 
producing commodities such as timber, palm oil, coffee 
and cocoa. The international commodity markets, in 
fact, have hardly changed from colonial times. 
 In many ways, those two economic relics are 
increasingly perverse and nonsensical. The 
environment is devastated, rural communities stay poor 
and the rich shift the blame. They cite lack of 
governance and corruption, but those are not drivers of 
deforestation, but symptoms of obsolete market 
constructs. 
 Therefore, global leaders must redraft economic 
theory and reinvent global markets for a sustainable 
future. For example, the latest estimate is that 
approximately $20 billion a year will be needed to 
halve carbon emissions resulting from deforestation. 
However, that would be a wise investment, even for 
that one ecosystem service alone. Forests sequester 
some 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. So, 
with today’s price of more than $30 per ton of carbon 
dioxide, rural communities are effectively subsidizing 
the carbon emissions of the rich to the tune of 
approximately $100 billion per year — more than total 
annual official development assistance.  
 Norway has provided great leadership towards 
that necessary paradigm shift. First, Norway has stood 
up against global climate change and has targeted the 
achievement of carbon neutrality by 2030. Norway has 
also dedicated $2.8 billion to offset emissions 
reductions resulting from deforestation in developing 
countries, through the valuation of forest ecosystem 
services. 
 Faced by the ravages of climate change on a 
small island developing State, our Prime Minister, Sir 
Michael Somare, has charted out his own bold goals: 
reducing Papua New Guinea’s emissions by 50 per cent 
before 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality before 
2050. Sharing a similar vision, the partnership of 
leadership between Papua New Guinea and Norway 
may significantly address several of the greatest 
 A/63/PV.13
 
5 08-53122 
 
challenges of our time: effectively valuing global 
environmental services, contributing to the mitigation 
of climate change, conserving global biodiversity and 
financing the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals in rural areas. 
 Finally, our global economy values companies in 
the billions simply for advertising trinkets on the 
Internet. Some countries make billions by selling fossil 
fuels that pollute our atmosphere, others by producing 
low-cost consumer products that humanity does not 
require. In fact, Google is worth $150 billion, while the 
world’s last great tropical forests left standing are 
worth nothing. How can that be right?  
 Together, we must reconstruct our value 
frameworks. New environmental markets must support 
tropical countries striving to achieve sustainable 
development, by generating billions from rainforest 
ecosystem services that humanity has so far been 
exploiting for free. 
 Several communities in my country have voted to 
cancel their logging concessions, telling me that the 
forests and rivers have provided all they needed for 
thousands of years. In some ways, however, they now 
feel trapped. The old ways allowed them to survive but 
did not prepare their children for an increasingly 
complex future. They now struggle with schools that 
cannot afford the best teachers and with health centres 
that provide only basic medicines. Yet those 
communities still remember how to live sustainably — 
a skill that many others have forgotten in the rush to 
get ahead. 
 But there is hope. Bold leadership is required on 
both sides of the economic divide to transform the way 
in which we value our environment and create wealth 
for rural populations. As leaders, we must understand 
that, while we may have inherited the Earth from our 
forefathers, we have in fact borrowed it from our 
grandchildren and our future generations. Indeed, by 
learning to save our environment, perhaps we can once 
again learn how to save ourselves and guarantee a 
better world for our future generations.  "
696,63,2008,KIR,"I bring warm 
greetings from the Government and the people of the 
Republic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am honoured to 
address this body this morning. Let me, at the outset, 
congratulate Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann on his election 
to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-
third session. I am confident that he will provide 
efficient and effective leadership in guiding this 
session towards a productive and concrete outcome for 
all. I would also like to thank his predecessor for his 
able and effective leadership during the past session. I 
should also like to acknowledge the election of 
Solomon Islands as a Vice-President of the General 
Assembly at this session. We are indeed very proud to 
have a Pacific brother in that position. 
 Every year, we come together as citizens of the 
international community to reflect on and discuss 
possible solutions to the daunting challenges that 
continue to face us individually and collectively. 
Climate change and sea level rise, environmental 
protection, food and fuel price increases and achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are 
among the challenges that I wish to focus on, in the 
interests of time and brevity. 
 For many years, we have tirelessly appealed to 
the Organization to do something about climate change 
and to provide solutions for those seriously affected by 
its detrimental impact, especially those whose very 
existence is being threatened. Those appeals have 
failed to produce practical solutions for people living 
in low-lying small island developing States like 
Kiribati. While the members of the international 
community continue to point fingers at each other 
regarding responsibility for and leadership on that 
issue, our people continue to experience the impact of 
climate change and sea-level rise and practical 
solutions continue to elude us. 
 The science on climate change is irrefutable. The 
fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change projected an increase in sea 
level of 0.4 metres within this century. While that may 
sound minimal to most, it is quite alarming for low-
lying small island developing States like Kiribati, 
whose elevation is no more than two metres above sea 
level and whose main source of water is underground 
aquifers. Before our islands are inundated by the rising 
sea, saltwater intrusion into our freshwater lens will 
render the islands uninhabitable. With the projected 
sea-level rise, Kiribati could be looking at 50 to 
60 years before that happens. Presented with those 
findings, we have had to adopt a pragmatic approach 
and to formulate options for our people. We do so with 
a great deal of regret and a deep sense of frustration. 
 Mitigation and adaptation strategies are and will 
continue to be integral components of our response to 
climate change. It would indeed be naive to suggest 
otherwise. Those strategies provide only short- and 
medium-term solutions. Ultimately, low-lying island 
countries like Kiribati will have to face up to the 
reality of their islands being unable to support life and 
to plan accordingly beyond existing adaptation strategies.  
 Kiribati is not a major emitter of greenhouse 
gases. Its mitigation efforts would therefore have an 
insignificant impact on the global climate change 
situation. Nevertheless, we will do our part and explore 
appropriate renewable and efficient energy technologies, 
as well as promote replanting in our islands. 
 While we also require adaptation strategies, our 
adaptation options are extremely limited, particularly 
given the nature of our islands. We are a country of 
low-lying coral atolls, with most islands rising no more 
than two metres above sea level. Coastal protection 
through seawall construction is the main adaptation 
measure currently being undertaken by the Government, 
but it is limited to the protection of public 
infrastructure. We simply do not have the resources to 
extend protection to private properties and assets. 
Adaptation measures, such as moving inland and to 
higher ground, are impractical for us. We cannot move 
further inland due to the narrowness of our islands, nor 
is there any higher ground to which we can escape 
from the rising seas. 
 It is encouraging indeed to follow the emergence 
of many climate change initiatives. It gives us hope to 
see that humankind is beginning to do the right thing. 
We have been following developments on those fronts. 
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge 
Australia’s commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and its 
  
 
08-51845 20 
 
recent announcement of its climate change programme. 
New Zealand has also announced its pledge to increase 
financial support for climate change. We also welcome 
Japan’s Cool Earth Promotion Programme and the 
European Union’s Global Climate Change Alliance, 
which support practical measures to address the 
impacts of climate change in the Pacific island 
countries. 
 The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change also states that the concentration of 
greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere will 
continue the momentum of climate change, regardless 
of any substantial reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions and mitigation efforts. That effectively 
means that low-lying small island developing countries 
like Kiribati are on the frontlines of the climate change 
calamity. Mitigation efforts therefore will not be able 
to reverse our situation — a situation that we have 
recently acknowledged and to which my Government 
has provided a long-term strategy for our people’s 
future and survival. 
 At the previous session of the Assembly, a 
question was raised regarding what we are to do when 
people start fleeing their countries, not because of 
political persecution but because of environmental 
catastrophe. That is the question that I want to put 
forward as a challenge to this session, and to which I 
wish to provide a possible answer, at least from the 
perspective of a country whose very existence is under 
serious threat. The relocation of the 100,000 people of 
Kiribati, for example, is not something that can be 
done overnight. It requires long-term forward planning. 
The sooner we act, the less stressful and the less 
painful it will be for all concerned. 
 That is why my Government has developed a 
long-term merit-based relocation strategy as an option 
for our people. As leaders, it is indeed our duty to the 
people we serve to prepare them for the worst-case 
scenario. The strategy involves upgrading the skills of 
our people to make them competitive and marketable 
in international labour markets. We want to target 
labour markets where skills or labour gaps exist and 
provide labour for them. We believe that offers a win-
win situation for all. We will be able to provide 
countries with labour and those countries will be able 
to provide potential new homes for our people. The 
strategy provides our people with an option so that 
when they choose to migrate, they will migrate on 
merit and with dignity. We hope that they will be 
received by their adoptive countries not as burdens or 
refugees, but as worthwhile members of the community 
with something to contribute. 
 We have already started implementing that 
strategy and we are indeed encouraged by, and grateful 
for, the support for that approach among our regional 
partners in the Pacific. Under its Pacific Access 
Category Scheme, New Zealand randomly picks a 
certain number of people from certain Pacific island 
countries, including Kiribati, to migrate to New 
Zealand every year. Recently, Australia launched the 
Australia Pacific Technical College, which aims at 
training Pacific people with Australian standard 
qualifications that will allow them to access regional 
and international labour markets. The bilateral Kiribati-
Australia Nursing Initiative is another example of a 
programme that supports that long-term strategy. We 
welcome them all indeed. 
 At the regional level, in August, the leaders of the 
Pacific Islands Forum adopted the Niue Declaration on 
Climate Change. That is a reflection of our concerted 
regional efforts to respond to the adverse impacts of 
climate change, which have been severely felt across 
our region. As the first-ever high-level climate 
document in our part of the world, the Declaration is 
indeed a milestone. It calls for collective efforts to 
fight the growing threat posed by climate change to 
many aspects of our lives and to our future as nations. 
 At the international level, we have been 
following closely the issues currently taking 
precedence on the United Nations agenda. It is indeed 
most gratifying to note that climate change is finally 
being given due recognition as a security issue. We 
welcome that development, as we believe that it is time 
the United Nations focused its attention on the human 
dimension of climate change. Discussions about carbon 
trading, the post-Kyoto Protocol era and even concerns 
over the future of polar bears have been, or are being, 
held. We welcome those discussions but, at the same 
time, we wish to express our deep concern that there 
has never been any discussion of the fate of humans, 
whose very existence is being seriously undermined by 
climate change.  
 That is the challenge that I propose that this body, 
the President and the Secretary-General address during 
this session. In that connection, I commend to the 
Assembly the draft resolution on climate change as a 
security issue and a threat to international peace and 
 
 
21 08-51845 
 
security. My colleagues from the Pacific have already 
alluded to it, and I commend them for their support. I 
also wish to applaud the excellent efforts by our Pacific 
ambassadors in New York, as well as their leadership 
on the draft resolution. I am also grateful to those who 
have supported the draft resolution so far, as well as 
those who we hope will do so in the future. We in the 
Pacific have been strong supporters of the fight against 
terrorism. We now turn to those with whom we have 
partnered in the fight against terrorism to partner with 
us in our fight against climate change. 
 Kiribati is proud to be home to the Phoenix 
Islands Protected Area, the largest marine protected 
area in the world. That was the result of a collaborative 
effort and partnership between Kiribati, the New 
England Aquarium and Conservation International. The 
Phoenix Islands Protected Area covers an area of 
around 410,500 square kilometres, making it, for now, 
the planet’s largest marine protected area. The Area 
covers over 11 per cent of our extensive exclusive 
economic zone of over 3 million square kilometres, 
while the land comprising the Area is over 3.5 per cent 
of the total land mass of Kiribati. 
 The Phoenix Islands are some of the most 
isolated islands on Earth and are largely untouched by 
man. In 2002, the countries of the world made a 
commitment to significantly reduce the current rate of 
biodiversity loss by 2010. Our declaration of the Area 
is in part a contribution towards meeting that target, as 
well as a statement by which we are saying that 
sacrifices must and can be made.  
 The preservation of those islands and the 
surrounding ocean is our gift to humankind, of which 
we are a part. Even now, as we confront the possibility 
that our islands will become uninhabitable within the 
century due to the rising sea levels, we recognize the 
value of protecting something that we believe to be the 
common heritage of us all. I take this opportunity to 
acknowledge the invaluable support and contribution 
of the New England Aquarium and Conservation 
International, our partners in this endeavour. We invite 
Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations, members of the private sector and 
individuals to join us in this worthwhile and ambitious 
initiative. 
 The recent hike in food and fuel prices is being 
felt by all, but more acutely by those living in drought-
prone, resource-poor and infertile small island 
developing States like Kiribati, who as a consequence 
depend highly on imported food. Our isolation from 
major markets means that the cost of transporting food 
items to our country is becoming more and more 
expensive. In addition, the cost of providing basic 
services to our people, who live on widely scattered 
islands, is also becoming a real challenge for all of us 
in similar situations. 
 We acknowledge the ability of certain members 
of the Organization to address this global challenge. 
We appeal to them to assist the most vulnerable 
members, such as Kiribati, with their food and energy 
security strategies. In that regard, we acknowledge 
with appreciation the assistance provided to our energy 
security strategy by our development partners, 
including Japan and Korea. 
 With regard to graduation from the list of least 
developed countries, the Committee for Development 
Policy will meet early next year to prepare the 2009 
review of countries that are deemed eligible to 
graduate under the methodology and indicators of the 
United Nations. Kiribati is one of three least developed 
countries of the Pacific — the others being Tuvalu and 
Vanuatu — being considered for graduation. We 
believe there are pertinent issues that warrant proper 
consideration by the United Nations with regard to this 
process.  
 One is the issue of the extreme economic 
vulnerability of small island developing States. Current 
indicators focus on improved performance on per 
capita income and human assets. Due consideration 
should be accorded to the special economic 
vulnerability to external shocks such as rising world 
food and fuel prices.  
 While it is not currently a graduation indicator, 
we believe that environmental vulnerability should be 
taken into account when considering the cases of small 
island developing States such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and 
Vanuatu, which are among the most vulnerable to the 
impact of climate change and extreme weather 
events — which, in turn, pose major challenges to their 
sustainable development efforts. 
 In that connection, I wish to commend my Pacific 
colleagues who have advocated the need to reform the 
application of the rule of graduation. We reiterate that 
call and urge the United Nations to reconsider the 
graduation rule in the light of the special economic 
  
 
08-51845 22 
 
situation and the vulnerability of those island nations 
to climate change and external shocks. 
 On the Millennium Development Goals, many of 
my fellow members will be familiar with, and share, 
the genuine desire to promote the development 
aspirations of our peoples, which is our priority. Even 
with our limited capacity, we are committed to the 
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. 
In that regard, I am pleased to report that Kiribati has 
launched its first report on the Millennium Development 
Goals. 
 The report outlines weaknesses and strengths in 
the overall development efforts and in meeting the 
MDGs. We believe that we are on track with our 
progress on most of the Goals, but we also admit that 
we are behind on some of them. The main reason for 
that is the lack of data to measure our progress so far 
and our limited resources to implement strategies 
aimed at achieving the Goals. We will continue to exert 
efforts in meeting the targeted Goals by 2015. At this 
time, I wish to express our deep appreciation to our 
development partners, who have accompanied us on 
this journey and have contributed meaningfully to the 
realization of our development aspirations. 
 While we commend the United Nations for the 
many initiatives put forward in addressing the needs of 
its Members, it is regrettable that it has continued to 
deny the 23 million people of Taiwan equal rights as 
international citizens to participate fully in world 
affairs. We believe that Taiwan has made an active 
contribution that has enriched the lives of many in their 
collaborative efforts in building and securing 
international peace and security. We believe that the 
people of Taiwan should be accorded the same 
fundamental right to participate as fellow citizens of 
the international community and to be allowed to 
contribute meaningfully in various sectors of the 
Organization’s activities. 
 The challenges that we face are global in nature, 
and therefore require global solutions. We call upon the 
United Nations to take the lead in addressing those 
challenges, especially in funding, supporting and 
facilitating the implementation of practical solutions to 
the security challenges that threaten the very existence 
of peoples and nations, which in turn poses a threat to 
international peace and security."
773,46,1991,AUS,"﻿I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am sure we will all benefit from your long experience here in the United Nations, and from your authority as President that derives from that experience. Australia enjoys strong bonds of friendship with Saudi Arabia and is honoured to serve with you as one of your Vice-Presidents for this session.
Australia warmly welcomes to membership of this body our Pacific island neighbours, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Equally, as a country of the Asia-Pacific region, we welcome the arrival at last of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. And Australia having been among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, we are delighted now to welcome those countries too to United Nations membership.
Mr. President, you are presiding over the General Assembly at a time when the United Nations is at last attaining the coherence and momentum necessary to meet the goals of its founders. The United Nations has sometimes been perceived as an autonomous entity - good or bad, progressive or retrograde, vibrant or moribund, according to the eye of the beholder. In fact, it can do no more than reflect the wishes of its Members and the relationships between them. Its success depends on the membership's capacity for compromise rather than confrontation, for generosity rather than greed, for humanitarianism rather than hostility - and for a measure of idealism.
Throughout the United Nations system a quite dramatic change of atmosphere has been evident since 1989, most markedly, though not exclusively, in security matters following the collapse of the cold war. Both the forty-fourth and the forty-fifth sessions of the General Assembly have been widely remarked as having been among the most harmonious and cooperative on record, with major progress on issues such as the environment, human rights and even the reform and rationalization of the United Nations administrative system itself. The old and all-too-familiar voting blocs acted less cohesively, and with more regard to consensus.
These atmospheric developments are partly attributable, of course, to flow-on effects from the end of the cold war, but they appear to owe rather more to an emerging world-wide recognition that a great many problems can really only be dealt with effectively by cooperation on a multilateral, and in some cases global, scale. To the familiar and established topics in this category, such as refugees, famine, debt and the control of nuclear weapons, have now been added issues such as major environmental problems, AIDS and narcotics. In an increasingly complex world the United Nations is itself becoming an increasingly complex place.
Those are all issues which this session, under your guidance, Mr. President, will need to address. They are also issues which will confront the new Secretary-General, whose appointment will be perhaps the most important decision to be taken at this session. This is not to suggest that the Secretary-General is more important than the Organization, but it is a recognition of the vital task the new Secretary-General will fulfil as the United Nations approaches its fiftieth anniversary. Much has already been said about the qualities which the new Secretary-General will need to take up the tasks that the United Nations is now able to, and must, address. Foremost amongst them must be integrity, an independence of mind and a willingness and desire to serve the United Nations in the interest of the Organisation as a whole. The Secretary-General must be a skilled and patient negotiator, with an intuition for the right moment to intervene and with the patience and stamina to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. He or she must provide intellectual leadership in the crafting of imaginative approaches to the multiplicity of problems, old and new, requiring resolution through the United Nations.
Of course, the Secretary-General cannot develop these ideas working alone; in this, as well as in other responsibilities, he or she must have the managerial capacity to harness fully all the resources and talents of those working in the Secretariat. Finally, in an age of mass communications, and with the spread of democracy, he or she must be able effectively to transmit the principles and purposes of the Organisation to a wider public which will provide it with its necessary base of support.
The agenda the Secretary-General faces can be summarized under four broad headings: political and security issues; development issues; humanitarian issues; and United Nations reform. That is a daunting collection on which I will offer some thoughts, though certainly not prescriptions. But before so doing I should place on record Australia's admiration for the determination and wisdom demonstrated by Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar over the past decade. He has served the world well through his personal involvement in a number of international issues, including Cyprus, Afghanistan, the Middle East and Iraq-Iran, and through his overall management of the United Nations in times of crisis such as during the recent Gulf war. He has shepherded the United Nations from confrontation to great-Power cooperation. Moreover in the past decade the financial situation of the United Nations has improved and there has been an increased preparedness to look to the need for administrative reform. He can look forward to the completion of his two terms with a sense of very considerable achievement.
When the history of the first 50 years of the United Nations is written I am certain that particular prominence will be given to Mr. Peres de Cuellar's outstanding contribution to the resolution of regional conflicts. Those in Cambodia and Namibia are but two examples, where my country has had a particular role and interest. The new Secretary-General will need to maintain this momentum and build on the pattern of cooperation which has been achieved between the major Powers.
United Nations representatives have played an outstanding role on Cambodia, and Australia regards with particular satisfaction the results of the meetings of the Cambodian Supreme National Council and the five Permanent members of the Security Council in Thailand in August and here in New York in the past few days. The Permanent Five, regional countries including the co-Chairman of the Paris Conference, Indonesia, under the very able guidance of its Foreign Minister Mr. Ali Alatas, and Australia, and the Cambodian parties themselves have all striven long and hard to achieve a peaceful settlement to the Cambodian dispute. All the signs are now that no obstacles remain to signature of a comprehensive settlement in Paris next month. But clearly, once a settlement is thus achieved, the peace will have to be consolidated, and that will be no easy task.
The United Nations will have before it one of its moat complex and costly decisions when the Security Council and then the General Assembly debate plans for the United Nations transitional authority in Cambodia. The authority's assignment will be daunting, but it is a mark of the very great distance we, as United Nations Members, have travelled in the last two years that such an undertaking will soon be a reality. I reaffirm hare Australia's willingness to make a substantial contribution to the authority and to continue to play our role as a facilitator of a lasting peace in Cambodia.
In the Middle East, there is now a batter prospect than in recent years for significant progress on Arab-Israeli issues as the international conference proposed for October approaches. What part the United Nations will play in the continued search for a resolution of the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli dispute will be, of course, a matter for the parties themselves to decide. It is clear though that the United Nations, and the new Secretary-General in particular, has the potential to play a constructive and valuable role.
We are also hopeful that the Secretary-General's continued efforts to achieve a settlement of the Cyprus question will bear fruit, the more so because of the personal effort the Secretary-General has invested in this task, and we would urge the parties to proceed with the proposed conference.
But just as we witness progress in those areas of tension on issues which have been on the United Nations agenda for some time, so new issues confront the international community. The violence now erupting in Sri Lanka and Yugoslavia is a stark reminder of the enormous difficulties which can result from social and ethnic tensions. We are all acutely conscious of how newly emergent nationalism within the borders of many existing countries around the world is creating a new set of strains end dilemmas in the conduct of international relations.
The most immediate area of concern for the international community is the situation in Yugoslavia. Australia, not least because more than 250,000 of our people have strong links of family and culture with Yugoslavia, has voiced its grave concern at the breakdown of constitutional order, the tragic loss of life and the impending threat of all-out war in that country.
The conflict in Yugoslavia has certainly reached the point where the international community needs to reinforce the efforts of the European Community to resolve the crisis. Australia has accordingly asked the Security Council to take up the issue and use its influence to help bring about an end of the fighting. There are important issues to be resolved about the future shape of Yugoslavia's republics, and in particular about the position of minorities within those republics. These are issues that must be seriously addressed and resolved by negotiation once the fighting has stopped, but there can be no justification for resorting to force to settle them. Unfortunately there can be no doubt that the conflict within Yugoslavia has now created a situation which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security in the region, and one which demands the attention of the United Nations.
With its new and constructive role of the United Nations come certain responsibilities and the need to recognize that changes in the international environment demand changes in this Assembly's approach to regional developments. For too long, debate and resolutions on a number of regional issues have been characterised here by outdated rhetoric. Let me make a plea to the Assembly that we might be able to consider changes to language which no longer reflects the new realities of the 1990s. For example, Australia hopes that debate on such traditional issues as the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, decolonisation and South Africa will be conducted in a fashion that acknowledges the opportunities for progress and, at least in South Africa's case, the progress already achieved. Similarly, Australia hopes that it may be possible to rescind resolution 3379 (XXX) of 1975 equating Zionism with racism.
No one can be complacent over the difficulties still ahead in the resolution of regional conflict. We do, however, share a genuine global sense of optimism about the future role of the United Nations in peace and security matters. There are four distinct areas of United Nations activity in this regard: peace enforcement; peace-keeping; peacemaking or preventive diplomacy; and arms control and disarmament.
The Gulf war was a classic case of peace enforcement by collective security measures. The founders of the United Nations recognised that it would have to have available to it as a final resort the use of force to resist aggression. But willingness to undertake enforcement action, by itself, does not constitute a system of collective security. Its actual use on this occasion will have a deterrent effect for the future, but the establishment of a true system of collective security also demands progress on multilateral disarmament, the development of confidence-building measures in various regions of the world and commitment to the removal, on a consistent and even-handed basis, of the root causes of conflict.
In fact, situations like Namibia and Cambodia involving peace-keeping forces are more likely than the Gulf situation to set the pattern of future United Nations action, that is, a form of peace-making activity which falls somewhere between good offices at one end of the spectrum and enforcement action on the other. The final settlement of a dispute will be through negotiation, but often with a peace-keeping component. Although peace-keeping operations were not originally envisaged in the Charter, they fit precisely the sort of circumstances which are likely to occur more often in the post-cold-war era.
The Secretariat has done an outstanding job in this area over a number of years and I must pay tribute to the individuals involved. There are now over 11,000 military and 3,000 civilian personnel from 54 countries serving in nine United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Middle East, the sub-continent, Cyprus, Angola and Central America. A further 2,700 personnel are on standby, ready to be sent to the Western Sahara. Five new peace-keeping or related operations have been approved in the first nine months of 1991 with UNTAC (United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia) yet to come, placing an enormous strain on those parts of the Secretariat responsible for their creation and administration. Clearly, resources must be increased and upgraded and we welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of the team of consultants to report on how the organisation of peace-keeping activities might be improved in the light of these expanded responsibilities.
In a new climate of international cooperation it would be logical to anticipate an expanded role for the United Nations in peace-making or preventive diplomacy. The new international circumstances underline both the need and the opportunity for the United Nations to expand its hitherto successful but limited activity in this area. More often now than previously, the United Nations must be able to identify potential conflicts, analyse their reuses and bring the parties to see the possibilities for resolution of their differences while conflicts are still only at the dispute stage. This will require both new approaches to and additional resources in the Secretariat for Information gathering and conflict resolution. What is needed chiefly is a body of skilled and experienced staff who can not only analyse information, but develop options for action which can be presented to the Secretary-General or the Security Council.
In order to establish the conditions for a global peace, the United Nations must also intensify its work on disarmament and arms control. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency are cornerstones of arms control. Revelations about Iraq's extensive clandestine nuclear programme in violation of its NPT and safeguards obligations, the first and only such case in the history of the Treaty, have highlighted the need for an even more effective and an even more intrusive safeguards regime that can meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond. We have warmly welcomed the recent decisions of China, Prance, South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania to become parties to the NPT and hope that these decisions will help influence those few countries remaining outside the Treaty to re-evaluate the benefits of membership.
We also welcome the stated intention of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to sign a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, in accordance with the obligations it accepted on acceding to the NPT Treaty. We look forward to the full, prompt and unconditional implementation of that agreement, because we remain concerned at the continued operation by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of an unsafeguarded nuclear facility and at reports that it has been building other nuclear facilities, leaving open the question of whether it is pursuing a nuclear-weapons capability. This course of action by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is destabilising to the Korean peninsula and to the north Asian region generally.
A universal and non-discriminatory register of conventional arms transfers under the auspices of the United Nations should also be established as soon as possible as an important international confidence-building measure. Australia participated in the United Nations expert group on conventional arms transfers. With the finalization of that group's recommendations and the support by the G-7 and the P-5 for the establishment of an arms transfer register, there is now an expectation of action by the international community.
The Gulf war underlined the crucial importance of a successful result to the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention. They have now entered a critical final stage. It is clear, however, that a further intensification of effort is required. The deadline of 1992 set by the Conference on Disarmament for completing the treaty must be observed. As I have proposed to my colleagues on the Conference on Disarmament, a meeting before too long of that Conference at the ministerial level will, in my view, be necessary to provide sufficient impetus for the negotiations and a political framework for resolving outstanding issues.
The Third Review Conference of the biological weapons Convention, held in Geneva last month, showed that there is a need for more to be done to further strengthen that important regime and, above all, to ensure that that Convention becomes universal.
In the new international environment, issues of international economic growth and development must take an even more prominent place on the agenda of the new Secretary-General. Substantial economic progress has been made in some regions, as for example, in parts of Asia and Latin America, but great human needs exist unaddressed, particularly in parts of Africa where, unfortunately, economic and social conditions have continued to deteriorate.
In the economic forums of the United Nations system, there is increasing recognition that each nation must be responsible for promoting policies that will encourage the participation of all sections of their populations in the economic and social development processes. Furthermore, a relationship is increasingly being noticed between human freedoms and sustained economic development. For the benefits of rational domestic policies to be fully realised, however, the major industrialised countries must play their part. They must maintain their efforts to foster greater stability in the international economic environment and take action to remove the international barriers to economic development.
The diminution in the security threat has enabled more resources to be available for development, both in the developing world and in central and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But it will be important to ensure that assistance provided in eastern Europe be additional to levels of assistance to developing countries and not represent a diversion of resource flows away from them. The alleviation of poverty in the developing world remains the central humanitarian challenge.
Perhaps most crucial, however, to the economic future of developed and developing countries is the need to strengthen and liberalise the multilateral trading system, both in the achievement of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round and in its aftermath. The importance of such liberalization was recognized in the United Nations international development strategy for the 1990s. Further liberalisation of trade would not only boost world economic growth, but engender the stability and confidence needed by the emerging market economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, as well as providing an important stimulus to development efforts in Latin America, Asia and Africa.
The issues of peace and security and of development have of course been central to the deliberations and activities of the United Nations for many years. They are issues that have demonstrated the role and functions of previous Secretaries-General and are issues that I am sure that the new Secretary-General will know well. What is new for all of us is the emergence over just the last few years of a whole group of previously neglected issues for which international solutions are now actively being actively sought - issues, moreover, which for the most part generate quite strong feelings, are not readily susceptible to straightforward technical negotiation and settlement, and so require great skill in handling.
Undoubtedly the most prominent recent addition to the new agenda has been the environment. While from the 1970s environmental protection became an important part of the domestic political programmes of many nations, it was not perceived than by moat governments as having an urgent international dimension. The 1980s saw a significant shift in both perceptions and reality and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil next year, will cast in relief the major new issues involved in the protection of the global environment in the face of the impact of climate change and increased threats to the biosphere. Every effort must be made to achieve ecologically sustainable development. As part of this process, due attention needs to be paid to the imperatives of economic growth and for appropriate mechanisms to be established for the transfer of technology to enable developing countries to meet the challenges involved in the protection of the environment. The interrelationship between protecting the global environment and ensuring global economic development will prove to be the critical issue as the end of the century approaches.
Human rights is not, of course, a new issue. The element of innovation lies in the way in which much past rhetoric of concern is now being translated into action, not only within the United Nations but in bodies such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The dramatic changes which have taken place in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe over the last few years have been matched by a significant diminution in the abuse of human rights. Equally there have been changes for the better in many parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. None the less, serious abuses continue, including in our own region - not least in Burma. We believe that further progress can be assisted through constructive dialogue of the kind that Australia actively pursues bilaterally and multilaterally. We believe it crucial that United
Nations human rights mechanisms be strengthened, and would encourage appropriate funding being provided within the United Nations system to accord resources for all human rights activities, including the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights.
The global refugee problem remains as large as ever. The challenge for Governments - and the international system - is to preserve the essential protections that must be extended to refugees while, at the same time, providing other appropriate responses and humanitarian assistance for persons displaced by other causes.
The United Nations will, regrettably, need to continue to respond to natural disasters and other large-scale humanitarian emergencies which occur around the world. Like other countries, Australia has been concerned for some time that coordination among the various organisations involved in United Nations humanitarian emergency relief is sometimes inadequate to the need. We wish to see improved coordination of such responses. What we need to devise in any General Assembly resolution is not some facile cosmetic response, but a carefully considered mechanism which actually works in practice.
In the aftermath of the Gulf war we have seen the United Nations revisit the key question of intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. The Charter notes explicitly that the United Nations is not authorised 'to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State'. Yet there are also basic goals in the United Nations Charter, in particular in the social and humanitarian area, which have always qualified the principle of non-intervention. The monitoring machinery successfully being developed by the Commission on Human Rights is but one example of how the balance struck between considerations of sovereignty and humanitarian imperatives has evolved.
Today we can readily endorse the Secretary-General's view in this year's annual report 'that the principle of non-interference with the essential domestic jurisdiction of States cannot be regarded as a protective barrier behind which human rights could be massively or systematically violated with impunity.' (A/46/l, p. 10) The United Nations role in Iraq following the war, while governed by the enforcement provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter, underlined, nevertheless, that sometimes such United Nations action is needed in the face of great humanitarian emergencies which threaten international peace and security even though there may be no agreement from the Member State most directly concerned. He are not yet at the stage where we can prescribe new activity or, indeed. Charter amendment for the United Nations to enable it greater flexibility to cope with such situations. But we have to recognize that there may be cases where a more flexible approach is in fact needed if the United Nations is to meet its global objectives successfully.
There is thus a widespread consensus that the present unwieldy Secretariat structure - the product of the conflict and compromises of the cold war and the uncoordinated responses to specific problems of the past - is not well suited to the range of tasks which Member States now expect of the United Nations and which, in the new international climate, it should be capable of performing. It is unreasonable to impose on the incoming  Secretary-General a structure which he or she will find so much difficulty in managing, which reflects past problems, not present realities, and which the new Secretary-General, as chief administrative officer, has had no input in shaping.
Australia would thus support a resolution in the General Assembly which would sweep sway these constraints on the Secretary-General and which would, on the basis of consultation with the incoming Secretary-General, establish procedures to ensure the recruitment from all regions of the most outstanding men and women to work in the Secretariat, and set out a new basic structure for the Secretariat which would permit it to fulfil its roles in the development of policy options to assist the deliberative organs and in the implementation of their decisions. The detailed elaboration of the basic structure should be the responsibility of the Secretary-General as the United Nation's chief administrative officer.
Ultimately, it will be for Member States and for the new Secretary-General to acknowledge that if the United Nations is, indeed, to become the sort of organization which its founders foresaw, now is the time. Never since the end of the Second World War has there been so much hope. That hope has to be translated into political will: to achieve and maintain peace, to better the economic lot of mankind, and to permit the individual to live decently and free from fear. In fulfilling this role the United Nations must be purposeful, energetic and adaptable. Its ultimate success will depend on the capacity of Member States to work together in the common interest. The achievement of which the United Nations is capable is worth the effort of all of us to bring about.
"
809,46,1991,VUT,"﻿Mr. President, we congratulate you on your election to preside over the General Assembly at this forty-sixth session. Tour diplomatic skills and experience are well known, as is your commitment to the principles and ideals of the United Nations. We look forward to a productive session under your capable leadership and congratulate the Government and people of Saudi Arabia as well.
We also congratulate Sir Michael Somare, the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea; Mr. George Iacovou, the Foreign Minister of Cyprus; and Mr. Abdalla Saleh Al-Ashtal, the Permanent Representative of Yemen. Each has made his own unique contributions to world peace and understanding. Each has dignified and contributed to the strengthening of the international democratic process here at the United Nations.
We also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Guido de Marco, the Foreign Minister of Malta. He proved to be well suited to the task of guiding our deliberations in this new era in international relations.
We join in commending the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. He and other members of the Secretariat have laboured tirelessly on behalf of the international community in its search for justice and peace. It is therefore fitting and symbolic that near the end of the Secretary-General's tenure, seven new Members should be admitted to membership in the world body.
The simultaneous admission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea bodes well for the future of the Korean people and enhances the prospects for lasting peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. The restoration of the sovereignty of the Baltic Republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, closes a sad chapter in human history, and offers new hope to others who await the restoration of their own sovereignty.
The admission of our Pacific neighbours, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, further attests to the universality of the United Nations and to the continued relevancy of the international community's focus on Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories. We congratulate all seven of the new Members. More importantly, we congratulate the United Nations on what each of these seven new Members symbolises, and on the qualities each brings to the Organisation.
On occasion, human history moves faster than the hands of those who would write that history. So much has transpired in recent months that the scribes of history have barely had time to allow the ink to dry before having to turn the page and begin anew. In some instances the scribes have not even had time to turn the page.
After a brief visit to Haiti, democracy has once again been 'exiled' by those who have continually brutalized the people of that impoverished country. Only a few days after he stood at this very podium and articulated his people's plea for justice, Haiti's President and the dream of his people were driven into exile. However, it is our belief that this will be a short 'exile' and that Haiti's people will soon restore their democracy and claim their future. He wonder how those who have assaulted Haiti's democracy expect to succeed in the face of the new expectations of Haiti's people and the broad international support which exists for that country's legitimately elected President.
Also freshly inscribed on the pages of history are a number of positive developments. Among them, are Guatemala's recognition of Belize and the establishment of diplomatic relations between these two Central American neighbours. The broad agreement between the President of El Salvador and the five leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation front is another very positive development. This agreement could lead to a truce in that country's long civil war and eventually help bring economic and social justice to that country's beleaguered people.
Cambodia has also taken a huge step towards securing a brighter future for its people. The Supreme National Council of Cambodia has taken several initiatives that could lead to an era of peace and national reconciliation. The permanent members of the Security Council and the Paris International Conference on Cambodia have contributed significantly to this process. Hopefully, the Secretary-General's five-point plan on Afghanistan will inspire the parties to that conflict similarly to negotiate a framework for a comprehensive political Battlement.
The ink of history is not yet dry on other parts of the globe either. One year ago the United Nations was justifiably preoccupied with an effort to re-write history by turning the pages of history back to the era of 'might make right'. Fortunately the international community rose to the occasion and Kuwait is now free of foreign occupation. However, the people of that regime, particularly those of Kuwait and Iraq, paid a terrible price. Our hearts go out to them. Others also paid a terrible price. Our hearts go out to them as well.
As important a step as the liberation of Kuwait was, it will lose its moral and legal significance unless the international community consistently applies the same principles everywhere. We must always judge the act and not the actor. Should we fail to do so, we can rightfully be accused of having a double standard. 
Principles which are selectively applied are not really principles but ere instead mere expedients. Therefore the United Nations should act in a comprehensive and consistent manner in circumstances similar to those which existed in Kuwait one year ago. Had the international community been consistent prior to the invasion of Kuwait, it is doubtful whether that invasion and the death and destruction it brought about would have occurred.
Years of inaction and the lack of resolve on the issue of Palestine and the occupied Arab territories are examples of the inconsistency that does little to enhance respect for the rule of law. The deafening silence on the question of East Timor by some who spoke so eloquently on the invasion of Kuwait is, to a country as small and vulnerable as Vanuatu, another frightening reminder of the inconsistency exhibited by some members of the international community.
The recent initiative taken towards the convening of an international conference on the Middle East enjoys broad support and may set in motion a process of negotiations that will lead to a comprehensive political settlement. He certainly hope such a chapter of history will soon be written.
With respect to East Timor, we are pleased that a delegation of Portuguese parliamentarians is about to make a visit to the Territory. He hope this visit will contribute to a settlement which will eventually allow East Timor's people to decide their own fate and write their own history.
We are encouraged by the prospect that Western Sahara's people will soon determine their own destiny and write their own page in the history of the United Nations. Equally encouraging is the positive and peaceful atmosphere that now exists in Lebanon. 
The decolonisation process, particularly that under way in Mew Caledonia, continues to be a major concern of the countries of our region. The positive measures taken by France to assure tranquillity in the Territory and to promote the economic and social development of its colonised people are much appreciated. What will be even more appreciated will be the moment New Caledonia gains its independence and joins the community of nations, as did two neighbouring Pacific Island countries at this session of the General Assembly. That will certainly be a joyous moment of history.
Democratic winds of change are also sweeping across Africa, from North to South and East to West. While much of the attention of the international news media has been focused on Eastern Europe, Africa has also witnessed important new historic developments. The ruins have fallen silent In Angola, where a full-scale military conflict has given way to what will, hopefully, be a purely peaceful political contest. Liberia may still be troubled but, hopefully, it has now turned the corner and will soon leave its most difficult days behind, as will Ethiopia and a number of other African countries whose peoples have endured more than their share of hardship and suffering. 
The institutional structure of apartheid continues to dissolve in the face of continued resistance by South Africa's people. The end of legalised apartheid will by no means end the problems of that country. Economic, political and social inequality are so deeply ingrained that it will take decades of concerted effort to remove the vestiges of the apartheid system. Hopefully, the international community will not abandon South Africa's people merely because those who currently govern that country now find themselves compelled to offer a series of reforms. Events are moving very fast in South Africa. New history is being written every day. However, as in other parts of the world, the past cannot be ignored in shaping the future.
With the danger of ideological conflict having receded in some parts of the world, there has been a tragic reversion to an older and more frightening type of conflict. On more than one occasion, the world has been warned of the dangers of inter-communal conflict and ethnic strife. For far too long those words of warning fell on deaf ears. Some insisted that this issue was strictly an internal affair of various countries. Others insisted that this was too sensitive an issue to discuss at international forums.
While fully respecting national sovereignty and recognising the domestic dimensions of inter-communal conflict and ethnic strife, we often wondered what it would take to make some members of the international community aware of the serious threat posed to all nations by such conflict and strife. Unfortunately, we now have the answer.
One need not single out any particular country or any particular region. Inter-communal conflict and ethnic strife are problems which plague the entire human race in every corner of the globe. Ho human being should ever be judged, or assigned a particular status, because of his or her race, religion language or culture. When hatred of this sort runs rampant, none of us is immune to the consequences.
Large countries and small countries can be victims of this hatred. Developed countries and developing countries can equally be victims. This hatred can be witnessed in parts of the world that are geographically remote from where we now sit. It can also be witnessed within a short distance of this very building.
One can examine our agenda and identify certain long-standing items that, in part, originated as inter-communal conflict or ethnic strife. History will indeed judge us harshly should we fail to address this issue and assert moral leadership on it, thus bequeathing our failure to future generations. It would certainly be ironic for history to record that the current generation dismantled physical walls or barriers but left standing other types of walls. Unfortunately, the latter type of barrier - that of ignorance, intolerance and ethnic hatred - is far more difficult to breach.
The rapidity with which history occasionally moves was recently illustrated in dramatic fashion. One week ago the President, of the United States announced a sweeping initiative which could for ever alter what had, since the dawn of the atomic age, been accepted as the normal rules of arms control. The announcement that the United States would unilaterally eliminate its land-based short-range nuclear weapons, withdraw its tactical nuclear arms from its ships, take its strategic bombers off alert, and cancel the development of the mobile MX missile represents another benchmark in the evolving relationship between the world's two foremost nuclear Powers. An equally dramatic response from Moscow is anticipated in the next few days.
One might legitimately wonder whether recent political events and technological developments had already made some of these weapons obsolete or superfluous. One might also ponder the costs and environmental consequences of eliminating these frightening weapons. None the less, President Bush's announcement just might give new impetus to efforts to rid the world of the threat posed by all types of nuclear weapons.
This initiative leads us to ask, once again, why nuclear weapons are being tested in the South Pacific despite the repeated objections of the countries of the region. The testing of these weapons in the South Pacific was always opposed on safety, moral and environmental grounds. Today there Is even less reason to understand the need for these tests. There are even more compelling reasons for our repeated appeals for their end to finally be heeded.
The international political climate is not the only climate that is changing. The climate that determines the sustainability of life on this planet, and the level of social and economic development achievable by human beings is also changing. This latter climate change has been occurring since the dawn of the industrial era, although at a somewhat slower, less perceptible pace than changes in the political climate. None the less, its impact will undoubtedly be greater than the impact of any political changes known to mankind.
The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change is currently engaged in what could be considered the most important multilateral negotiations ever. The outcome of these negotiations might, in the long run, determine whether human life can continue to be sustained on this planet. The negotiations might also shape the manner in which mankind's economic activities are conducted. It is difficult to imagine more important subject-matter. 
Every country in the world is participating in these negotiations. It is hoped that the negotiations will be successfully concluded in time for the convention to be opened for signature at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) at Rio de Janeiro in June of 1992.
All countries have a great deal at stake in the negotiations leading up to the Conference. Environmental issues and economic issues are interrelated and of equal importance. Small, island developing countries and low-lying coastal countries have another concern - survival. These are the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise caused by global warming. As such, they are likely to be the first victims should the international community fail to agree on a collective response to mankind's most severe challenge.
Much remains to be done to ensure the successful completion of the negotiations for a climate-change convention. Even more remains to be done to ensure that the UHCED is meaningful and successful. Hopefully, the United Nations system and Member States will spare no effort in providing adequate support to ensure the success of these parallel processes. We shudder to think of the consequences of our failure to do so.
Much of the change taking place in the world today revolves around principles of democracy and the commitment to democratic ideals. Democracy and democratic ideals are not constants which once planted can be ignored or left to their own devices. Democracy and democratic ideals are, rather, like a garden in need of constant care and attention. They must be fed and nurtured or they can wither and die, or even be overgrown by weeds disguised as flowers. We know of no instance in history in which democracy was very easily established. Instead, the establishment of democracy took considerable effort and years of turmoil and unrest in even the oldest of democracies. It will take similar effort in today's evolving democracies. Ho nation in the world has a perfect democracy. No nation in the world has a monopoly on democratic ideals. Certainly, no nation has a history which allows it to lecture others on the subject: or hold itself up as a perfect model to be emulated in every respect.
From time to time, democracy and a nation's adherence to democratic ideals are tasted. This is as true of nations as large and powerful as the Soviet Union or the United States as it is of nations as small and removed from the centres of power as Vanuatu. We believe that eventually, in all such instances, democracy will triumph. History instructs us that people everywhere, and the evolution of the human experience, will accept nothing less.
The United Nations is today the highest form of international democracy. It is not yet a perfect international democracy. Its imperfections and shortcomings are known to all. What are sometimes forgotten, however, are its very positive attributes and its many accomplishments. In the history of mankind, there has never been any international or intergovernmental organisation as democratic or as successful as the United Nations.
Thus, as we undertake the work of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and take one additional step towards the twenty-first century, let us feed and nurture our garden of international democracy. Let us reflect upon and recommit ourselves to the democratic ideals which have brought us together in search of justice, equality and peace.
In a symbolic sense, our seven new Members have entered the Organisation at the right moment in history. They can be an important new source of energy and nutrition for our garden of international democracy.
In conclusion, we recall the moving words of a Mozambican poet written 2C years ago during his country's struggle to free itself from colonialism. Although those words were written at a different time, in a different place, and under circumstances different from those which exist today, they still bear a certain symbolic relevancy to mankind's mutual undertakings of today.
We hope these words can be understood and appreciated in that context. They are simple words of compassion for fellow human beings. In their simplicity, they reveal many truths: 
'So man; paths we have trodden already! So many people we have greeted liberate clothed fed taught
Along our march!
So many plains, mountains, rivers we have crossed! It is still far the day of independence, but each passing day it is nearer. ...
We advance-instruments of an ideal
loftier than ourselves
Released from our former solitude.
Sometimes we pause by the wayside Attracted by a child who bails us, a chance-born flower, a certain smile, a distant star.
We pause within ourselves; our steps continue and we meet again further on. He cannot be late. There, the enemy continues to enslave our people 
To arms Comrades!'
"
856,46,1991,MHL,"﻿Please permit me to extend to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations upon your election as the President of the General Assembly at this session. You have our confidence that your tenure will be marked with great success.
To you, Mr. Secretary-General, we wish to express our highest regard and admiration for your outstanding leadership, particularly during the recent crisis in the Middle East, whereby you were able to redefine and strengthen the role of the United Nations as the most appropriate peace-keeping force in the world.
I should also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, to extend our congratulations and best wishes to the other six nations that have become Members of the United Nations at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.
It is a singular honour for me to speak to address the Assembly today as the representative of a new Member State of the United Nations, the Republic of the Marshall Islands. One week ago my country's flag was raised outside  this noble edifice, joining the flags of the other Member nations. The past week has seen the fulfilment of one of my highest aspirations. I have been received with profound courtesy and consideration, for which my nation and 1 thank all the members warmly. We shall always be grateful. 
When one searches for the Marshall Islands on large maps of the world, one may have difficulty finding them, for they are shown as mere specks. Those specks represent 34 atolls and coral islands with an average elevation of just over one metre, situated in the centre of well over a million square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean. The Marshallese people, about 45,000 all told, are descendants of the voyagers who came in canoes across the uncharted sea to find and settle our islands more than 2,000 years ago. In this remote environment with its temperate climate we formed our own nation and developed our own unique culture, which has withstood the test of time. 
As was the case with so many nations in this Organization, the Marshall Islands experienced significant foreign contact during the nineteenth century, which in some ways forever altered the evolution and direction of our nation. During the past century we have experienced first hand the ravages of war and paid the high price of maintaining peace. We have been ruled by others while learning and developing the framework and institutions of modern democratic government for ourselves. We have maintained our culture and traditions while pursuing our economic development to better the quality of life of our people. In the end, these apparent contradictions have resulted in nothing less than a transformation of the Marshall Islands from an isolated, traditional Pacific island society into a modern nation-State now taking its place in this world Organization that is premised on the principle of sovereign equality for its Members.
Permit me to pause here for a moment to do something that my advisers tell me is not often done by nations whose sovereignty has been newly restored after a century of colonisation: to praise our last colonial Administrator, which, as it happens, was set up over us by this Organisation. The plain truth of the matter is that we could never have come so far as we have without the aid and encouragement of our former Trustee, now our good friend in a relationship of equality. I refer, of course, to the United States of America.
I wish to confirm that the Republic of the Marshall Islands binds itself to the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations. My Government makes a pledge to conduct its affairs as a responsible member of this Organisation. We earnestly and wholeheartedly enlist in the community of those who work to develop planetary loyalty as a complement to national loyalty.
The Marshall Islands has watched with great interest the events that have transpired over the past two years, and while we have not been a direct participant in these events we have none the less felt the impact of current world trends. While people may differ as to the long-term meaning of these events, two things seem to be quite clear.
First, as the founding Member States of the United Nations envisaged, there is an essential need for the United Nations to enable the nations of the world to collectively consider and deal with issues of international security. Although there will continue to be disagreement among Member States in this respect, the United Nations has also clearly demonstrated that it has both the potential and the ability to resolve international disputes and to maintain world peace.
Secondly, in terms of economic and social advancement and development, the United Nations is the only institution that can realistically deal with these issues on a global scale. The tremendous differences between the constituent Members of the United Nations - large and small, wealthy and poor - can be reconciled and coordinated only through the United Nations itself.
Indeed, it is perhaps this second point on the role of the United Nations that will pose the biggest challenge in the future. Since the Second World War and the founding of the United Nations the primary challenge has been to deal with issues of international disputes, security, politics, problems associated with, and resulting from, the so-called cold war, and decolonisation with the emergence of the new nation States. No doubt, many of these issues will continue to require attention, with the United Nations taking the major role in laying the necessary foundation for the maintenance of world peace and harmony. In the view of the Marshall Islands, the time has come for the United Nations to give greater and broader recognition and attention to the economic and social issues facing the nations of the world.
While issues of international security are inexorably linked to economic and social issues, the quality of life of mankind is, in the end, the most important and fundamental issue facing the nations of the world and this Organisation. Consistent with national agendas and policies, people need the opportunity and the freedom to develop themselves. Their unimpeded efforts will invariably result in the desired progress and development of their respective nations.
Recognizing and confronting this most important of all tasks is the only way in which the world can have durable and lasting peace. This, we submit, is the biggest challenge facing the United Nations, and it is the fervent hope and desire of the Marshall Islands that the United Nations, through dedication and hard work, will be able to provide the requisite framework whereby mankind can truly improve his condition.
It is a difficult challenge, but not insurmountable. However, we must begin to meet it at the individual level. In this respect, I am reminded of a poem by an author who is unknown to me:
'If there is righteousness in the heart, there will be beauty in the character.
If there is beauty in the character, there will be harmony in the home.
If there is harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation.
If there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.'
One issue that in fundamental to economic and social progress, as well as to our very existence, is that of the environment.
The problem of global warming - the so-called greenhouse effect - is a most formidable one. As I mentioned earlier, the Marshall Islands is a country comprising entirely low-lying coral atolls in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It goes without saying that the consequences of global warming could be totally catastrophic for us as well as for other countries similarly situated. Accordingly, we would make the following observations.
First, scientists throughout the world are not in accord as to the magnitude of the entire problem. Some have predicted considerable atmospheric deterioration, resulting in a significant raising of the sea level within the next several years, while others see the effects of global warming as insignificant for the foreseeable future. This lack of consensus on the subject is most disturbing, and leaves us in a quandary as to what the future may hold.
Secondly, there is very little, if anything, that one of the smallest and most isolated countries in the world can do to alleviate the problem, other than continue to raise it in the international community.
The Marshall Islands is cognizant of the uncertainties in this matter, as well as of the knotty issues to be resolved between the developed and the developing countries. We applaud the recent initiatives of the United Nations on the subject and fully support those initiatives. He are hopeful that through the efforts of the United Nations there will be consensus in respect of the extent of the problem, as well as a sound course of action to remedy, or at least allay, the effects of global warming.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands is fully aware of the great importance of providing a sound system of education for its people, and we have committed a great deal of our limited resources to the education of our population. However, we also feel deep concern about the educational level in our schools. We need better schools, but are hard-pressed to develop them through our national resources alone.
Nevertheless, we foresee that better schools, and a better start in life, can be realized in our islands through the globalization of education.
As I turn my thoughts homeward, I see a barefoot child sitting on a wooden bench or perhaps on a dirt floor in a one-room school-house on a remote island. This child needs to be equipped with the necessary knowledge to be useful to his nation as well as to the world. In this context, through education there lie many of the answers to many of our problems.
I think of that child as summed up in an ancient Marshallese expression that is enshrined on our national seal, 'Jepllpilln ke elukaan', which conveys to us the idea that a child is a national resource just as is a sprouting coconut tree. Each must be nurtured as it grows. Each generation in turn enriches the soil for those that follow. If children and trees reach their optimum growth they bear fruit that will sustain, replenish and enhance the community, the nation and, ultimately, the world itself.
I believe that this allegory is salient to the concept of the globalization of education. As world-wide education takes place in the context of sharing and broadening existing knowledge, information and beliefs among the peoples of the world, we will in turn develop the necessary framework for succeeding generations by strengthening individual human development and the quality of life. In addition, we will have greater awareness of our commonalities and differences to better maintain world peace and order without the use of force.
In education, we see bright hope in the concept of the global village. Improved communications can make a remote little school a campus of a world-wide university using existing technology to provide interactive long-distance education. Students can ask questions, receive answers and debate issues across continents and oceans. We believe that cooperation within the United Nations will play a dramatic role in bringing this dream to actuality within our lifetime.
Earlier I referred to economic and social issues as the biggest challenge that the United Nations is facing now and will be facing in years to come. In terms of economic development and trade issues, we note the tremendous differences and disparities which exist among the nations of the world.
As a very small developing nation, the Marshall Islands is aware of the recent initiatives and developments on economic and trade issues in the context of our own national development agenda.
Achieving economic prosperity at both the national and the international level is a difficult task and is an unending challenge for all mankind. Much of the economic progress of the world has been frustrated by political unrest and unreasonable barriers that often derail courses of action and interaction among nations. We are hopeful that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations will be productive and successful.
Lasting peace and security among nations is the most fundamental underpinning for economic progress in the world. In this connection, the United Nations should be accorded much of the credit due in achieving the necessary peace and security to foster a healthier environment for economic advancement.
Since the Second World War, the nations of the world have advanced with greater experience and knowledge in technologies and economic strategies. Today, we see a greater interdependence among the nations of the world in matters of economic development. As we view it, the emergence of regional economic blocs is indicative of a new trend that has great potential through further international cooperation a trend in which new economic concepts and strategies are applied to achieve greater and sounder economic progress in all regions of the world. He are hopeful that the successful and full participation of all nations in the various regional economic blocs will eventually pave the way for the creation of a new and unified global economic system.
The Marshall Islands is taking some steps in economic development, which is essential to itself and which also may be beneficial to other nations. As our economy grows, we hope that our small nation can become a part of this trend in the sense of what we call 'the Pacific way': that is, no nation should be left cut.
Finally, I should like to touch briefly on the subject of current world events in terms of what is often referred to as the emergence of a new world order, particularly from the viewpoint of a very small nation such as the Marshall Islands.
As we seek to determine the meaning of recent world events in the context of historical trends, we must start by acknowledging that the world has never been fully at peace. The history of regional and world peace and attempts to bring about such peace is really, in essence, mankind's history of conflict and war. Peace exists when there is an absence of conflict or political, economic and social problems that form the basis for conflict.
To the extent that there is a discernible pattern to the history of world conflict it has throughout the centuries mostly been regional or simply man fighting with his immediate neighbours. Mankind lacked the technological ability to engage in a global conflict until this century, in which we have seen the waging of two world wars followed by a cold war that was premised on building and maintaining giant arsenals as a deterrent in order to maintain world peace. How, in the light of current world events we see that the likelihood of another world conflict has been greatly diminished with the United Nations truly taking its place as the premier organisation for the maintenance of world peace. None the less, we are simultaneously witnessing a resurgence of regional and internecine conflict.
Does this mean that the world is returning to the past, or does it mean that we are ushering in a new era? I personally would very much like to believe that it is the latter, and that what the world is experiencing at present in terms of conflict represents the last convulsions in the process of attaining true and lasting world peace.
Over the last few years we have witnessed dramatic events which have fundamentally altered the political, social, economic and physical landscape of the world. These changes present us with the challenge and opportunity to re-examine the laws, institutions and values which have governed the relationships of peoples and nations. It is in this spirit that we offer some thoughts in respect of what is currently referred to as the new world order.
The formation of the United Nations some 46 years ago, with its vision of a new era of peace, human rights and international co-operation, brought great hope and promise to the world's peoples. Indeed, the United Nations has helped to usher in an unprecedented degree of international co-operation, mutual respect and understanding among the peoples and nations of the world.
However, at the same time, it has become increasingly evident that the available international machinery and processes need to be greatly strengthened to ensure peace and security in the world and to address newly emerging global issues.
Long-term solutions to the many issues facing the world will require a new and comprehensive vision of a global society, supported by a new system of values. This recognition does not imply the abandonment of legitimate loyalties, the suppression of cultural diversity or the abolition of national autonomy. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a far higher aspiration than has thus far animated human efforts. It clearly requires subordination of national impulses, needs and interests to the imperative claims of a unified, peaceful and prosperous world.
I wish once again to express heartfelt thanks and gratitude on behalf of the Republic of the Marshall Islands on the occasion of our accession to membership in the United Nations. We look forward to working with all of you with the staff of the United Nations and with the specialised agencies.
It is an honour to be serving as an active Member of the United Nations, and as a full participant, in striving to meet the goals of the Organisation and the challenges of the future.
Once again, Kumol Tata - thank you very much.
"
888,46,1991,NZL,"﻿Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and the people of New Zealand let me first congratulate you on your election. It has certainly been a momentous year both for you and for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
I should like also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar, who has worked tirelessly over the past 10 years towards the reduction of tension throughout the world. As he comes to the end of a decade of service I offer to the Secretary-General my congratulations, and those of the Government and the people of New Zealand on his personal contribution to the cause of peace.
I am delighted to join you, Sir, in welcoming new Members to this forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In particular I want to welcome the Federated States of Micronesia - a new member of this body, but a familiar friend to my country as host of the most recent meeting of South Pacific Forum nations. I am delighted that they and their close neighbours, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, are joining us at this time.
It is a source of immense satisfaction that we see here today for the first time the legitimate representatives of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of these three European nations that have struggled against totalitarian rule for so long. Their international recognition as independent sovereign States brings to an end a chapter in their history when they were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.
Their independence and membership of this Organisation coupled with the membership of the Republic of Korea, which I warmly welcome, and the membership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea signal the end of an era, or more importantly the beginning of a new era, in international relations.
New opportunities in politics and trade command our attention. New problems constantly challenge our capabilities. In Yugoslavia, we see a situation that cries out for peaceful resolution. Mediation has been tried. It must be tried again. It will never be successful unless and until the parties to the conflict are prepared to commit themselves fully to the process. So my Government appeals to all other members of the international community that might have some influence - direct or indirect - to use that Influence to persuade the parties to the conflict to commit themselves to mediation if they cannot resolve their differences peacefully on their own.
Today the problems may look intractable but difficult issues can be solved. Already the change in global politics has been rewarded by significant progress in the field of disarmament. The super-Powers have committed themselves to substantial reductions in their arsenals of nuclear weapons. While the world warmly welcomes each new step in the reduction of nuclear weapons agreed to by the super-Powers, this progress is undermined by the actual or potential proliferation of nuclear weapons to other nations. Therefore on arms control nothing is more important than moves to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
New Zealand, as one of the first nations to sign and ratify the United Nations Non-Proliferation Treaty, firmly believes that attempts to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons must be an agenda item of the highest priority for the Organisation. The dangers from nuclear weapons are such that a failure to halt their proliferation would seriously diminish the recent success in strategic arms reductions.
We welcome the decisions of France and the people's Republic of China to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Now that the Treaty will cover all the current nuclear Powers of the world. New Zealand urges all parties to agree to its indefinite extension in 1995.
In singling out nuclear weapons for particular attention, I do not in any way diminish the work needed to control other weapons of mass destruction, such as those using chemical or biological agents.
The importance of the task of stopping the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction should be firmly embedded in the minds of thinking people everywhere following the fearful possibility that Saddam Hussein would use such weapons during his illegal take-over of the State of Kuwait. That act of aggression tested the strength and commitment of this world body.

We can all take pride in the fact that the leadership shown by the United Nations in the exercise of its undoubted moral authority was successful in facilitating the coming together of a great coalition of nations who were determined that the might of Saddam Hussein would not succeed and that Kuwait would be restored to its independent sovereign status. During the dangerous weeks of the Gulf crisis the United Nations, with strong leadership from the Security Council, showed firmness of judgment and a commitment to the ideals of the United Nations that has reinforced the status and authority of this Organisation. The Security Council was able to reflect accurately the mood of the General Assembly because of its broad representation aerobe regional lines and its inclusion of the small and vulnerable as well as the large and powerful.
I want to pay a warm tribute to Kuwait's Arab neighbours, who were resolute in their support of the rights of a small independent nation and refused to back down to intimidation or threats. Their steadfastness in the early stages of the crisis was a major reason why Kuwait was eventually liberated.
The role of the United States in bringing together the coalition of nations who worked in concert to liberate Kuwait was an impressive display of international diplomacy. United States forces, with their British, French and Arab counterparts, gave an equally impressive display on the ground and in the air. But overriding the achievements of the individual nations was the commitment given by nations, large and small, to the military task force that gathered to halt aggression and to guarantee the independent sovereign rights of the small nation, Kuwait. I am proud that my country played a small part in that coalition and has been able to contribute to the post-war United Nations commissions, such as that on the disposal of weapons of mass destruction.
As a small country in the south-west Pacific, we do not threaten anyone, nor do we peek to impose our will on other countries. But in joining the coalition we honoured a New Zealand tradition to oppose tyranny and support freedom. Luckier than a number, all our military personnel came home safely on this occasion, but many of their forebears in pursuit of the same goals rest alongside the battlefields of the modern world. We have never shirked our responsibilities.
As we opposed a dictator in the Gulf, freedom-loving people around the world have rejoiced as we have witnessed, too, the collapse of totalitarian communism in Europe. That system was defeated not by force of arms but by ordinary people, in their hundreds of thousands, reaching in the streets to reclaim their God-given right to freedom of thought, expression and assembly and their right to democratic government. It has been a glorious victory for the indomitable spirit of the human person.
But let me sound a note of warning: this impressive victory could turn to bitterness, and hope to despair, unless all nations show equal courage in addressing an equally unprecedented economic challenge. The helping hand that both the emerging democracies of Europe and the developing countries of the world need most is the hand of trade. So, today, the barricades we must pull down are not those erected to prevent tanks but those erected to hinder trade.
To sustain and secure the dramatic political changes that have occurred, to deny dictators the excuse for coveting others' territory, to ease the
crushing debt burdens that too many countries face, to provide an economic alternative to the destruction of our environment - to do all these things, and more, we have to realise that a change in the international trading system is essential. Without change, how can the new democracies in Europe do what they want to do for their people if their exports face restrictions in foreign markets? How can debt-ridden developing nations ever pay their way if they face not only similar restrictions but subsidised competition too?
This is not a debate that can be drawn wholly across North-South lines, because trade restrictions occur on both sides, as does subsidisation. This is a debate about giving meaning to the many fine words, about helping those who are struggling to escape poverty, and about securing the democratic freedoms so recently won. This is a debate about complementing aid with trade.
The Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations began nearly five years ago. It was, and remains, the moat ambitious of all the trade negotiating rounds. Yet it is in real danger of faltering if the political commitments that were given in 1986, and have been repeated since then - moat recently at the G-7 meeting this year - are not translated into the substantive decisions that are already overdue.
A country like mine, dependent on trade for its very livelihood, finds it incredible that political and economic leaders who are responsible in so many things, who are participating in, and encouraging, the dawn of a new political era, have not yet broken the log-jam in the negotiations. Certainly the G-7 group of industrialised countries, under the chairmanship of the British Prime Minister, gave us cause for new hope. Certainly the United States has been, and remains, a strong proponent of a liberalised international trading system. Thoughtful leaders In the European Community, and many leaders in the developing world, have all called for greater progress.
But it seems to be a case of words, words and more words, but little action. If we are to succeed, action must now take the place of words. Time is running out. The alternative to a successful and substantive conclusion to the Uruguay Round is often said to be a series of trade blocs - groups of countries turning in on themselves, failing to realise their full competitive advantage) surviving, perhaps, but at a lower and more unstable level than would be possible in a liberal world trading system.
All this is quite possible, but I suggest that it is not the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is those countries that have found new freedoms having those freedoms taken away by regimes who use the excuse of the need for economic control of disintegrating economies as a cover for political oppression; it is having stable countries being made less stable because they cannot earn the foreign exchange necessary to provide for the legitimate aspirations of their people; it is turning the clock back rather than forward.
With a view to avoiding that - and avoid it we must - I make a plea from this rostrum that the barricades that prevent fair trade be taken down. And if the powerful will not do it to help the weak, then they should do it for the selfish reason that it is the only way the world will secure a lasting peace. Trade between nations is what breaks down fear, and the sharing of resources by trade is what prevents ware of acquisition. If the selfish win, if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade fails, then today's leaders will have planted the seed of future conflicts. That is a strong message, but it is no more so than the seriousness of the situation warrants. 
Let us achieve a milestone in the progress of international trade this year, so that we can move forward with confidence to the United Nations Conference on Environment, and Development next year. A free and fair trade system is central to our efforts to conserve and enhance the environment. We have already made progress on issues such as driftnet fishing and with the Montreal Osona Protocol) but we need to maximise these gains by ensuring that States fully observe the measures that have been adopted in such fields. Next year's United Nations Conference in Brazil will be the real test of our ability to cooperate in the endeavour to find the proper balance between development and environmental protection. My country is the first anywhere to enshrine the concept of sustainable development in legislation on natural resources.
Just before I departed from New Zealand seven students from seven continents of the world lit a candle for peace in front of Maori tukutuku panels symbolising the seeking of knowledge. They were greeting the dawning of this new session of the United Nations General Assembly. The students participated in this ceremony in New Zealand because ours is one of the first countries to see the sun rise, and a ceremony at dawn is the traditional Maori way to acknowledge a new beginning.
We in this Assembly can all rejoice in that we are seeing new beginnings in many parts of the world: in Europe, in Cambodia, in South Africa. We must not let this moment in history pass; we must now replace an understanding of how to destroy each other with a new understanding of how to live and trade with each other. It is my most fervent hope and prayer that this great assembly of nations has the moral courage to do not only what is necessary but what is right.
















"
891,46,1991,PNG,"﻿On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, it is my pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session.
As you are aware, Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister, Sir Michael Somare, was a candidate for the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. As a democratic country whose Constitution is based on United Nations principles and practices, we of course accept the collective decision of this body in electing you as its President. We pledge ourselves to working with you during your term of office with much pleasure and gratitude. On the basis of the principle of shared responsibility, we intend to maintain our strong commitment to the United Nations. We will continue to make our modest contribution to the work of the world's highest body.
Allow me to place on record Papua New Guinea's appreciation for the excellent job accomplished by your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Guido de Marco of Malta. Among his pressing responsibilities, he has been instrumental in the ongoing reform exercises at the United Nations, and my delegation commends his contribution to that important development.
Papua New Guinea's commitment to the United Nations is rooted in our Constitution, which establishes a democratic system of government and protects the basic rights and fundamental freedoms of the individual within the framework of society. Our national Constitution provides for due process of law to ensure that personal liberties are protected by impartial and independent courts of law. Within our constitutional framework, we have established an extensive and working legal system of checks and balances to ensure that executive government is fully accountable to its people.
The fundamental provisions of our Constitution embody the ideals and values of democracy, more conducive within our Melanesian practices of consensus in democratic decision-making. We support the processes of democratisation now under way throughout the international community.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the new Members to the United Nations. Their membership is a clear indication of their support for the increasing importance of the United Nations. We join other delegations in congratulating and welcoming the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as new Members of the United Nations. We also congratulate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Korea and the Republic of the Marshall Islands for their admission as full Members.
This is indeed an event of historic Importance for the Governments and peoples of those States, and we join them in celebrating this important and unique occasion. My delegation is particularly proud to witness the admission of two members of the South Pacific Forum, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, because we have contributed towards the process of self-determination and independence for both those island States. We are pleased that the aspirations of their peoples have been realised. Papua New Guinea firmly believes also that the admission of the two Koreas as members of the international community is a significant development in the region. It is our sincere hope that their admission to the United Nations will accelerate and provide an additional avenue for dialogue in the reunification process.
The Assembly convenes at a time of rapid change in the global political, economic and social arenas. It is also a period when there is ever-increasing concern for the future destiny of our global environment. These developments have placed the international community in a more precarious position than ever before. Therefore it is vital that this Assembly continue to play a leading role in finding solutions concerning these challenges. In this regard, we welcome the reform exercise that is currently being pursued at the United Nations to improve its effectiveness.
The achievements over the years of the United Nations system are commendable, particularly in the areas of decolonization, disarmament, the environment, social justice and the maintenance of world peace and security. My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, for his strenuous efforts in upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We strongly believe that a strengthened United Nations system is necessary so that it can play a pivotal role in promoting peace and security as well as equitable economic relations between developed and developing countries. Papua New Guinea, since its accession to independence in 1975 and its subsequent admission to membership to the United Nations, has played and will continue to play its part consistent with the underlying principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.
We ARE encouraged by the positive changes in relations between nations. The marked improvement In East West relations, particularly between the super-Powers, and their combined efforts to find solutions on many of the global issues bring hope and optimism to international cooperation.
While we were alarmed at the recent developments in the Soviet. Union, we are, however, pleased to note the positive developments that are currently taking place in that country. It is our hope that that great country will, through negotiations and dialogue, find solutions to its current difficulties and continue to contribute to international cooperation and development.
Our region, the South Pacific, is relatively free of major conflicts and tensions. Nevertheless, we are not immune from the effects of external problems elsewhere. The South Pacific Community is comprised of many small island States scattered throughout the vast South Pacific. We largely depend on a limited number of agricultural and marine products for our livelihood and export income. Our struggle is, therefore, one of survival.
While we welcome positive contributions towards the overall development of our region, we also believe that external efforts in this development process should not lead to situations that would threaten our environment, our limited resources and in particular our livelihood.
For these reasons, the South Pacific Forum initiated and concluded a number of important, arrangements to safeguard our region and our resources. These arrangements include the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment and the Convention for the Prohibition of Drift-net Fishing in the South Pacific.
Last year marked the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is also the desire of the United Nations to ensure total eradication of colonialism by the year 2000. Even though the struggle against colonialism has been largely successful, our region still places great importance on the emancipation of the remaining colonial Territories and their peoples around the world, including those in the South Pacific.
My country remains committed to the work of the Special Committee on decolonisation to ensure that the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism is effectively implemented.
My delegation is particularly encouraged by the measures being taken in New Caledonia by the French authorities under the Matignon Accords, in cooperation with all sectors of the population, to promote equitable political, economic and social development in order to provide a framework for that Territory's peaceful evolution to self-determination and independence.
We welcome the willingness of the French Government to allow a South Pacific Forum ministerial visiting mission to New Caledonia this year. Likewise, we further seek the cooperation of the French authorities to facilitate regular visits to New Caledonia by visiting missions of the United Nations to monitor the developments in that Territory.
My Government believes that in order to facilitate smooth transition to self-determination and independence, the Administering Authority must enhance opportunities for assistance in education and training, especially for the Kanaka of Hew Caledonia. There are other dependent Territories in the region which must also be given opportunities by the Administering Authorities concerned to achieve self-determination.
Mora than ever before, the environment-related issues have increasingly occupied an important place on the agenda of the United Nations, as well as being of concern to individual countries and regions. The continuing deterioration of our global environment is a matter of grave concern to all of us. If this trend is allowed to continue unchecked, it will most certainly disrupt the global ecological balance and jeopardise the Earth's life-sustaining capacities.
We in the South Pacific are alarmed at the changing global climatic conditions which threaten present and future generations with untold economic and social consequences. Therefore we appeal to the world community to consider with the utmost seriousness how we can control global patterns of production and consumption, to avoid the degradation of the global life-support systems.
The global warming and climatic changes which are causing rising sea-levels are a direct threat to the very survival of the small island States. In this regard, we commend the efforts of the Association of Small Island States to seek the cooperation of the international community to develop a framework convention on climate change.
We firmly believe that international cooperation in the field of environmental protection calls for global multilateral approach so that all aspects of the issue can be considered, while, at the same time, the development priorities of developing countries are retained.
We are pleased with the progress being made towards the convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil in June 1992. My Government looks forward to constructive and meaningful contributions by participants to ensure that we take collective measures to protect and preserve our global environment.
Papua New Guinea will continue to work with other member States of the South Pacific Forum in opposing nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear and in our other toxic region. We appeal to the international community to conform to standards prescribed under the London Convention on Dumping as well as the regional safeguard arrangements to which I have referred earlier. These arrangements are important to us for the protection and survival of our region and our people.
My delegation is, however, concerned that, despite long-standing opposition by the South Pacific Forum, France continues to carry out its nuclear testing activities in the region. We strongly urge France to consider seriously our concern and take positive measures to put an end to this act of terrorism against the ecosystem and humanity.
In this connection, Papua New Guinea welcomes the decision by the Government of the United States to cease the operation of its chemical-weapon incineration facility at Johnston Atoll.
Japan's recent decision to cease drift-net fishing in our waters is also applauded, and we hope other distant-water fishing nations can make similar declarations soon.
Lasting solutions for some of the current conflicts around the globe constitute the only prerequisite to international peace, security and development. Papua New Guinea welcomes the acceptance by all parties of the framework agreement for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian conflict.
My Government believes that the continued involvement of the United nations is necessary in order to ensure the peaceful resolution of the Cambodian problem. By way of a modest contribution, I am pleased to confirm that Papua New Guinea is prepared to participate in any United Nations peace-keeping arrangements in Cambodia.
My delegation commends the efforts of the United Nations in working towards a peaceful resolution of the question of Western Sahara in line with the appropriate resolutions of the Security Council. We are, however, disappointed that progress is being impeded owing to the current problems in Western Sahara. We are hopeful that the participating parties will allow dialogue and reconciliation to continue and enable the Sahraouis to determine their own future destiny. The impasse in the search for a solution in regard to the Middle East question continues to concern my Government. We have always maintained that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland as much as Israel has a right to exist within secured borders. We believe these two conditions are fundamental to any lasting solution of the problem.
Papua New Guinea has, on many occasions, voiced its concern over the institutionalised apartheid system that exists in South Africa. The latest developments in that country are encouraging, and further steps should be taken to accelerate the process of totally dismantling apartheid in all its forms. He acknowledge the pressure exerted by the international community against the racist South African regime, particularly through the adoption of appropriate United Nations General Assembly resolutions and the sustained dialogue between the various political groups in that country. My Government firmly believes that the final eradication of apartheid and an improvement in relations between South Africa and the neighbouring front-line States, as well as the return of the country to a united, non-racial and democratic system, would provide peace and security in the entire region. It is our firm conviction that sanctions should be continued until the apartheid system is completely dismantled. This institutionalized racism, under apartheid, is indeed a crime against humanity.
The universality of membership of the United Nations is an important objective of the international community. The realization of social justice and equity for all the peoples of the world must be given equal priority by the world community. The United Nations must therefore place people at the centre of all its activities concerning world peace and security. There is a need for all Member States and international civil servants to make every effort to humanize the institutions of the United Nations system so that they may efficiently and effectively contribute to the improvement of the social conditions of the masses of suffering people throughout the world.
The social and political evils of poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, drug abuse, and inequality between men and women and between States are still
prevalent. In this regard, my delegation would like to appeal to all Member States to lend their support for the proposed world summit for social development, which was endorsed at the session of the Economic and Social Council in Geneva this year.
There are many changes taking place in the world economy. We observe, however, that these changes in international economic relations have not brought about any fundamental change in the unfair international economic order. The situations regarding external debt, economic growth and the reverse flow of capital remain unchanged.
The shift by Eastern European countries towards market-oriented economies, the move towards a single European market, and regional initiatives such as Asia-Pacific economic cooperation can have serious consequences for the developing countries. These problems have been further compounded by continuing global economic recession, inflation, high interest rates, rising unemployment, lack of investment, slow growth and protectionism. All these factors contribute to slow progress and to the stagnation that has a considerable effect on the social and economic well-being of developing countries in particular.
We believe that developing countries are deprived of the opportunity to take advantage of the new technological revolution, which has promoted the internationalization of production and finance and has given a new impetus to the growing integration of the world economy. It therefore appears evident that disparities between the developed and the developing countries win continue to grow if the underlying problems are not adequately addressed with a view to enhancing and promoting equitable trade and economic cooperation between the developed and the developing countries.
My Government wishes to appeal to the international community to recognise that it is of vital importance that in the ongoing Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations the multilateral trading system, should be fully responsive to the special needs of developing countries, particularly with regard to the consideration of commodity prices and the protection of agro-based and other light industries. He also believe that the Uruguay-Round negotiations should lead to the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement and safeguards based on the basic principle of non-discrimination and on the preservation of the flexibility available to developing countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
We in the Pacific depend largely on tropical agricultural export products to raise foreign exchange to meet the needs of our people. We have, however, experienced enormous difficulties as a result of both fluctuating commodity prices and the discriminatory trade policies of some developed nations. In this regard, we join others in the international community in urging all participants in the Uruguay Round to commit themselves to a comprehensive and successful end to the negotiations and to underline the importance of fair trade to all countries.
Papua New Guinea values its relations with the European Economic Community, particularly under the umbrella of the various Lome Conventions. It is our hope that the current political and economic problems in Eastern Europe and the move towards a single European market in 1992 will not in any way affect the agreed provisions put in place under the Lome IV Convention. We believe that the diverting of development assistant to Eastern Europe will have a negative effect on the economies of the developing countries.
Never before has the United Nations enjoyed such widespread support for its efforts, and never before have international civil servants been called upon to help guide so many different peoples to peace, democracy and independence. It is a cull to which they have responded with the exceptional talent, experience and dedication that the world has come to expect from them. These tasks are undertaken sometimes at great personal cost to the international civil servants, who chose to uproot themselves and their families for the duration of their assignments. Many have been detained and held hostage during the course of their duties. We call on those responsible to release and free them to their important duties and to their families.
As for those who have paid the ultimate price and laid down their lives while working for peace, Papua New Guinea salutes their sacrifice and cherishes their memory. As we move into this session of the General Assembly and towards its probable mandates for more United Nations missions, the independence of the international civil service must be guarded more carefully than has been the case in the past.
In conclusion, we wish to emphasize that the aspirations to world peace, and to fair and just development, cannot be realized without political realism and recognition of the dynamics of international politico where narrow political ends of the most powerful States are pursued. International economic and political structures, as they exist today, promote inequality and imbalances. The United Nations cannot, and must not, be used as a legitimizing tool for powerful States utilizing their military arsenals to achieve their narrow political ends.
The global humanitarian concern for all States Members of the United Nations is to take positive steps to minimize inequality between nations, and between different societies and peoples within each State. The prime mission of the United Nations, and the challenge of the 1990s, is to move away from rhetoric and make genuine efforts to evolve economic and political structures at the international level that will support development processes capable of securing and enhancing social and economic justice for all. That is the mission for mankind.
"
917,41,1986,NZL,"Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election. We have a great deal of work to get through at this session. I know from my meeting with you yesterday that you will guide us skilfully through the rough water we will inevitably meet. Let me say, too, how good it is to see the Secretary-General restored to full health. We need his wisdom and courage at this time.
I appear here today as the representative of a small country from the southern reaches of the vast Pacific Ocean. Forty years ago my country was amongst those which pledged their commitment to the objectives of this world Organization. How much nearer are we, today, to achieving those ideals? Enormous problems confront us. Technology has expanded humanity's horizons into outer space. But here on earth we have not yet succeeded in providing basic human needs - food, shelter, and at least a minimum degree of security - for all. Under the Charter we have all abjured the use or threat of force. Yet the most powerful nations among us seem unwilling to take the decisive step of rejecting the weapons of mass destruction that threaten us all. Today, more than ever before, small States need the protection that the Charter and this Organization were intended to give. The United Nations was intended to represent our interests, for the powerful are better able to look after themselves. If we who are small are not to be ignored by those who are mighty, then we must work together here to ensure the survival of this planet.
New Zealanders know from recent experience that this Organization can respond quickly and fairly to the needs of small States which call for its help.
In 1985 my country was suddenly embroiled in a dispute with France. It concerned the detonation of bombs fixed to a ship at a wharf in one of our harbors. A crewman of Dutch extraction lost his life. The circumstances were widely blazoned across the world press and need not be further recapitulated.
Despite lengthy bilateral negotiations we were not able to solve the problem. With France, we then turned to the United Nations for help in finding an acceptable solution. Both countries undertook to abide unconditionally by the United Nations arbitration. The Secretary-General took on the task himself. He made a ruling which both Governments accepted without reservation. It has been carried out by both of us. I want to record my Government's profound gratitude to the Secretary-General for the commendable way he carried out that task. Through his mediator efforts we have been able to bring to an end that unhappy episode.
Our experience in the field of decolonization has also shown us, once again, how this Organization can help us in fulfilling our obligations to bring dignity and self-respect to all people. My country is responsible for helping bring to nationhood a tiny territory in the South Pacific: Tokelau; remote, beautiful, but with few resources other than the fish in the sea around the three small atolls and the determination of its peoples. Our Government invited a United Nations visiting mission there in July to see the unique development issues confronting that atoll community. I am pleased to see members of the mission here today. We have found, as in the case of other island nations whose histories have been entwined with ours, that the United Nations could indeed make a useful and innovative contribution to the process leading to self-determination. That is an example that could well be followed again in another case in the South Pacific; and I shall return to that later.
It is clear that the United Nations can help if small nations shew that they want it to do so. Nobody believes that problems that have bedeviled us for years will be solved overnight. But one thing is clear: whatever the issue -international security, the right to live in freedom and peace, or freeing the shackles on international trade - the small and the vulnerable have much more in common with one another than with the big Powers. Separately, we may achieve a little*, together we may yet move mountains, perhaps even the Rockies and the Urals.
Today there is no greater incentive for us all to work together than the need to bring under control the fast-quickening nuclear-arms race. Arms control and disarmament are not pious goals; they are immediate and desperate imperatives. Nuclear weapons have become the subject of a monstrous exercise in self-perpetuation. We know now that none of us, even those in as remote a place as New Zealand, or more remote still, could escape the consequences of their use. All too graphically the scientists have shown us that.
The central point, surely, must be that, when you have arsenals that can destroy humanity, you can have no security. By their very nature, nuclear weapons subvert and distort the intention of Governments to provide security for their people. So-called nuclear logic always seems to require the next terrible step: the production of a new weapon to prevent the last from being used. The ceaseless search for balance is really endless escalation; security, like a desert mirage, is never reached. We sink further into insecurity and fear. The balance of terror has been raised one more notch. It is well named. And despite the truly awesome consumption of resources, it seems we are edging towards yet another new and uncontrolled level of arms technology and spending. An arms race in outer space must not be permitted. Where one nuclear giant leads, the other will surely follow.
Of course, the arms race does not exist in a vacuum. It is a reflection of deep-seated distrust and scarcely concealed hostility. Only earnest diplomatic action aimed at sincere detente will remove the distrust. Only decisive political action can end the arms race itself. No one underestimates the difficulty of managing the transition to a world without nuclear weapons, which must be the ultimate goal - but the nuclear 'logic' that equates more nuclear weapons with greater security cannot be allowed to go on sabotaging the process of arms control and disarmament negotiations. What security is there, I ask, in a system under which mischance, malevolence or madness may entomb not only the nuclear Powers, but all of us?
With the fate of the world in their hands, how can the two major nuclear Powers continue to refuse to respond promptly and positively to the overtures each has made to the other? The leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union, separately and together, have given indications that progress can be made. The tentative steps they have taken seem to shew that there is common ground. They agree on the need for deep cuts in nuclear weapons. Their proposals now lie on the negotiating table. They must not just lie there. The political will of the major Powers to end the arms race will be judged by what they do now to narrow the negotiating gap between them. An old adage says: 'Procrastination is the thief of time.' Time is fast running out. The nations of the world, all but a handful of them non-nuclear, cannot wait much longer; they have waited too long already.
Nor can we, the small countries, simply conclude that it is a problem only for the nuclear Powers to solve. He must take a hand, together. New Zealand welcomes the successful conclusion earlier this week of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. As earlier speakers from both East and West have noted, the agreement should make a significant contribution towards reducing tensions in Europe. That benefits not only Europe, but the wider international community. The agreement is most welcome after a long period of stalemate on arms control and disarmament negotiations. But it is only a beginning. We urge the larger Powers to get on with resolving their wider differences. Meanwhile there are things which the small can do, steps which we can take in co-operation with one another to encourage disarmament.
Among practicable arms control measures, the most urgent is a comprehensive test-ban treaty; one that would ban all testing by all nations, in all environments and for all time. No other single step would do so much to slow the remorseless advance of nuclear-weapon production and experimentation, or to establish confidence in the will of the nuclear Powers to eliminate nuclear weapons from the world's arsenals. It would be a truly universal arms control measure.
There may be more than one route to a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The ending of testing by any State, even temporarily, is a step forward and should be welcomed. A mutual moratorium by two or sore would be better still, even if a temporary one. All such steps give time for talk and delay disastrous escalation.
There may be other provisional measures involving all the nuclear-weapon States which would help establish confidence and encourage a commitment to negotiate a permanent ban on testing. But none of these can be a substitute for a comprehensive test ban. The New Zealand Government will again join with others in calling on the Conference on Disarmament to start immediately with the work of drawing up a comprehensive test-ban treaty. New Zealand, too, is ready to take part in an international system for monitoring a test ban. We have some facilities in place for monitoring testing in our own region and are preparing to improve them.
There is room for smaller powers to act in the regional sphere, too, in practical ways that the United Nations has recognized as valuable. For its part, New Zealand will not permit nuclear weapons in our country, even temporarily, as on visiting ships or aircraft. We intend to keep our land, our waters and our ports, and our air space nuclear-free.
With the members of the South Pacific Forum, an annual gathering of 13 independent states, we have moved to establish a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. The Rarotonga Treaty was adopted over a year ago now. It prohibits the acquisition, stationing or testing of nuclear weapons by any of its parties. This year's forum at Suva adopted three Protocols to the Treaty. These call on the major nuclear Powers to respect the zone. I am glad to be able to tell you that some have already indicated their willingness to sign these Protocols. The New Zealand Government, along with others in the region, hopes they will soon be endorsed by all those countries eligible to sign. But, the South Pacific will not be free of the scourge of nuclear testing until France accepts that the security concerns of a distant European Government should not thwart the legitimate desire of the nations of the South Pacific to live in peace and safety in a nuclear-free environment. For too long, far too long, the Pacific has been used as a testing-ground by the nuclear Powers. Two of them stopped testing there long ago. It is time for France to follow their example. I would note also, in passing, that contrary to what has been said earlier in this debate, the report of the Scientific Mission that visited the French testing site at Mururoa Atoll in 1983 does not provide a basis for asserting that those tests 'are being carried out in unquestionably safe conditions,' (A/41/PV.8, p. 71). That report specifically refused to rule out the possibility of serious damage to the Atoll and its surrounding environment in the longer-term future.
The South Pacific countries are increasingly confident of their place in the international community, certain of what binds them together, determined to preserve their cultures, committed to the principles of democracy and consensus and willing to work closely with those nations that genuinely pursue co-operation.
The micro-States in the vast ocean region that I come from present unique development challenges. New Zealand makes a major contribution, and we welcome the assistance of other countries in the region's development. Such assistance, however, is only one contribution towards economic growth. Equally important are fair and equitable returns for the region's limited resources, the produce of its |	land, its slowly expanding manufacturing exports and, most important, its fish.
All that calls for international co-operation.
The United Nations was involved earlier this year in another major step forward in the development of the Pacific. On 28 May the Trusteeship Council recommended that the Trusteeship Agreement over the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Northern Marianas should be terminated. At its
meeting at Suva, the South Pacific Forum welcomed that development. New Zealand was a party to the Forum's consensus. The peoples of those Territories have said what they want. That is decisive. The United Nations has discharged its responsibilities, and the process of decolonization is coming nearer to completion in the South Pacific.
There is a lesson here for New Caledonia. Our experience of decolonization has shown us that the United Nations can help bring about peaceful evolution. The South Pacific Forum has always regarded New Caledonia as a neighbor that should take its place as an independent member of the South Pacific community. It is, by history as well as by unchangeable geography, an integral part of the region. Unless its stability is preserved, the stability of the whole region and all its member States will be seriously affected. Forum members are concerned that the Territory's move to independence should take place peacefully. That means by negotiation. France clearly has the power to bring about change peacefully. It is deeply disappointing to us and to our South Pacific neighbors, therefore, that in the approach recently outlined by the present French Government it seems that independence is no longer its goal for New Caledonia. I noted this morning the statement of the French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories, reported in today's Herald Tribune. He said:
'When Australia and New Zealand are advocating independence for New Caledonia, they are advocating independence for a territory that would be under Libyan control.'
Such a claim is farcical. We are not supporting any faction of the independence movement in New Caledonia. We support true self-determination for all real New Caledonians. The South Pacific Forum leaders have made it clear that they want to maintain a dialog with all the parties to see if a more promising situation can be brought about. The Heads of Government of the countries members of the South  Pacific Forum decided last month to seek the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. That move was strongly endorsed by the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement at their meeting at Harare. My delegation, with other South Pacific com tries, welcomes that support. We look forward to a positive decision by the Assembly and to a constructive solution to New Caledonia's travail.
We all know that economic stability and prosperity are a necessary condition for real security. The need for international action by the vulnerable is as pressing here as it is in any other field. New Zealand, like many developing countries that are reliant on commodity exports, depends for long-term economic growth on its ability to trade fairly in those areas in which it has a comparative advantage. Yet we are being prevented from doing so by the absurdities of a distorted world trading system. Agricultural trade has generally been excluded from the international trade rules and disciplines. It is the first area to be hit by new protectionist measures, especially non-tariff barriers; it is the main victim of domestic production subsidies which, in the large developed countries have reached a level that even they now recognize as unsustainable. But it is the rest of us, the efficient producers, who have to deal with the massive over-production dumped cm world markets and that brings down returns for everyone.
The problems of agriculture are a time-bomb ticking away under the world trading system. An explosion would threaten not just the prosperity of individual countries but global economic and political stability. That is why New Zealand attaches great importance to progress in a particular United Nations forum, that of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The new round of negotiations recently launched at Punta del Este offers a vital opportunity for the international community to establish just and equitable rules for the conduct of agricultural trade. That will be the measure of the new round's success. It has to succeed. It will not succeed without pain, as New Zealand well knows. But if it fails, the credibility of the whole multilateral system will be thrown into question.
There is a need for international action on Africa, too. New Zealanders have been deeply moved by the plight of the sub-Saharan people, who continue to be afflicted by drought and famine. New Zealanders continue to work alongside the Government in supporting churches and other organizations undertaking rehabilitation projects. In the week before the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa they contributed substantially yet again to an international appeal, in this case Sport Aid.
The outcome of the special session was welcomed as a starting point for planning strategies for the future. The endeavors to work out practical measures to bring about an end to Africa's economic and developmental problems are encouraging. The co-operation and commitment with which the special session's deliberations were conducted must be sustained if its sound recommendations are to be put into effect.
New Zealanders have also been shocked by events in southern Africa - the violence in South Africa's black townships, the South African Government's further repression of rights and freedoms, the attacks on defenseless targets in neighboring countries, carried out simply to give a political message, and South Africa's obstruction of Namibian independence. For a while, it looked as though the entirely reasonable approach adopted by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group might be successful in bringing all parties in South Africa together to negotiate a new political dispensation. The South African Government's rejection of those efforts, signaled as it was by the contemporaneous and wanton bombing of neighboring capitals, is to be deplored. Negotiation is always the preferable way to bring about necessary and lasting changes acceptable to the majority. The chances of a negotiated end to South Africa's troubles now look slim indeed. Such as they are, they must be grasped, or a holocaust will surely follow.
The common theme in each issue I have raised is the need for united action. And in each case it is clear that the United Nations can play a crucial part, provided it has the support of those - the overwhelming majority of its Members -who are small, whose individual power is slight. It is disturbing, therefore, to see a weakening - even a conscious undermining - of the commitment to multilateral action. It is long-standing political indifference or, in some cases, hostility, which is the cause of the United Nations financial crisis. The selective withholding of contributions - a practice in which one major contributor has recently joined another - cannot be condoned. Nor can the action of those who allow dues to fall into arrears. But we have all contributed to the current crisis. We have pretended to believe that political problems could be solved simply by calling for more financial resources, more studies, more staff. Well, we were wrong. Entirely new measures are necessary, at once more drastic and more constructive.
The Secretary-General took prompt and decisive action earlier this year to avert the immediate cash crisis. His package of measures was designed to contain the crisis this year. This Assembly must look at the longer term. It must be resolute.
For we are in no better shape financially now than we were in April. We must recognize this in looking at the proposals before us both for economies and for reform. By a positive approach we emphasize to those owing funds that, while we cannot accept their disregard of binding Charter obligations, we are prepared to help ourselves. We small States have the most to lose - so we must find a way forward.
We in New Zealand welcome the report of the High Level Group. We strongly endorse its consensus findings. We commend them to the membership. We must go on to develop quickly an agreed approach to the reform of the program and budget process,, We must begin to run this important Organization like any self-respecting business - in the interests, that is, of its shareholders, the Member States. In the process, all of us are going to have to accept some curtailment of our favorite programs. We accept that. Compromise from all will be required.
Reform of our finances, management and administration is the first requirement, for it is the prerequisite to efficiency.
More important in the end, though, is the way this Organization goes about fulfilling the objectives of its Charter. I found myself in complete agreement with some observations two days ago of the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands and I- cannot do better, in conclusion, than to refer to them. He said:
'Differences in ideologies and cultures are a fact of life. But polarization and mutual recrimination are not their inevitable corollary.' (A/41/PV.9, p. 46)
I would add that although they are a possible and, as things stand, all too likely corollary, they are the very things this Organization was founded to dispel and to avoid for the future. They can only lead to ever deepening mistrust and hostility. It is no use pretending we are not going to disagree and from time to time disagree bitterly. What we must do is face that reality and instead of papering over differences by what the Netherlands Minister rightly called 'the practice of false consensus', we must seek in a real spirit of reconciliation, and friendship, to find constructive and hopefully permanent solutions to the great and serious questions that today threaten to divide much of the world into two hostile camps. We must not risk being seen by future generations as having spent our brief and precious time here preparing for war, rather than working for peace.


"
956,41,1986,VUT," Mr. President, I have the honor to convey to you the congratulations and best wishes of the Government and people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Your unanimous election to preside over the forty-first session of the General Assembly is a tribute to you and to the Government and people of Bangladesh. We add our voice to that of those who have already spoken so eloquently of your broad experience, your skills and your dedication to the principles and ideals which unite us in this world body.
We congratulate your illustrious predecessor, Jaime de Pinies, for the outstanding manner in which he carried out the duties of President. We also associate ourselves with the many expressions of appreciation and praise for the work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.
We are pleased to see that the Secretary-General's health has been restored. It is to be hoped that we, the nations of the world, will ease the burden of his high office by following up our expressions of praise with concrete deeds that are consistent with our Charter and the sentiments expressed by those moving words. Matching our deeds to the words might assure the future good health of our Secretary-General and the United Nations itself. Such a course of action might even assure the good health of our very troubled world.
Last year at this time we gathered to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization. For a brief period, the world's attention was focused on the United Nations and the dramatic activities here at Headquarters. A few observers were drawn to, and mesmerized by, the obvious glamor and excitement of that historic event. Most, however, waited anxiously for the results of our thought and reflection on what had been achieved during our first 40 years and what had not, where we have been and where we are going. For us, and for most of the world, it was less a period of celebration and more a period of critical evaluation.
Today , we are not commemorating a notable anniversary. There fore, fewer cameras, microphones, flashbulbs and notepads are present. Fewer words are written, fewer said, and even fewer listened to. None the less, what we say and do at this session will be just as important and crucial to the future of the human race as what was said and done at the last session.
This year, the mood is quieter and more subdued. The airports, hotels and restaurants of our host city are not quite as crowded today as they were c
one year ago. The streets and highways approaching the United Nations are not as jammed with official motorcades, and the general public is not- as affected by, and therefore not as concerned with, our deliberations. However, as little has changed foe the better since we -last met, our current session is, in a very real sense, every bit as dramatic, urgent and intense as the last. A cursory glance around the globe reveals why.
The prisons of South Africa are even fuller than they were one year ago. The refugee camps that house the people of Palestine are even more crowded than they were one year ago. More people have been killed as a result of the senseless and tragic war between Iran and Iraq. In Lebanon, more children have been deprived of the innocence of youth and turned into soldiers as even more death and destruction have been visited upon that once serene land. Cyprus continues to be divided and occupied by a powerful neighbor.
More debt has accumulated in South America, threatening that continent's democratic advances. More firepower and less development aid has been pledged to the people of Central America, and new obstacles have been placed in the path of the Contadora process. A few still speak of the 'five' States in Central America, forgetting the existence of Belize, and the fact that it is a home to many refugees and that it, too, is vulnerable to the region's instability.
The people of Kampuchea and Afghanistan are no closer to being allowed to live in peace and choose their own destinies, free from all forms of foreign interference, than they were one year ago. The people of East Timor, and those of other territories in our region, are no closer to being free to determine their own futures that they were one year ago.
We are no closer to seeing a referendum held in Western Sahara than we were last year at this time. South Africa is no closer to aiding its illegal occupation of Namibia than it was one year ago. Certain foreign economic interests are no closer to ending their illegal and immoral looting and pillage of Namibia's resources than they were one year ago.
The illegal traffic in deadly drugs has increased, and more young lives have been ruined, if not ended, as a result. Individual and State terrorism continue unabated in absolute defiance of every known standard of decency and common sense. France continues to test its nuclear weapons in our region, disregarding the objections of the countries of the region and the harm caused to our environment.
Throughout the world, more people are hungry, homeless, unemployed and, as a result, frustrated or without hope. Gaps in real income between nations and between individuals have widened. Everywhere one looks, the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. Yet, somehow, in the midst of all of this, the inventory of nuclear weapons has grown larger.
Despite all of this, there is a faint glimmer of hope. FOr millions of people in every corner of the earth, the United Nations still represents mankind's finest qualities. It symbolizes their dream of justice, equality, and peace. They care little about celebrations and commemorations. Diplomatic dinners and receptions are very remote to them, but the United Nations and its specialized agencies are not. That is why we must make sure that the Organization is not destroyed or emasculated, but instead strengthened and made even more relevant.
The financial crisis facing the United Nations is, as everyone knows, in reality a major political crisis. As such, it commands our attention and demands, above all else, our candor.
A great deal has been written, and even more has been said, on the subject of the imperfections of the United Nations. Critics point to our lengthy debates, repetitive speeches, strident resolutions, and our frequent waste and inefficiency. The criticisms are not completely without merit. There is considerable room for improvement.
However, one must ask why the United Nations' most vociferous critics do not begin with a candid self-examination. What measures have they taken to correct similar, if not worse, shortcomings  in the various national and local governmental bodies of their own respective jurisdictions? Are we to believe that the United Nations is unique in its frequent waste and inefficiency? Is this the only place where there are too many lengthy speeches and too many divisive resolutions? Of course not.
Let us pause for a moment and carefully consider what the most vocal critics have to say about the excessive number of resolutions passed each year. We happen to agree with that criticism. However, it does not go far enough. We should also ask why Cyprus is still occupied*, why the Palestinians still can't go home or even call their hone their home; why apartheid still exists in South Africa; why Namibia is still not interdependently so many other questions on our agenda are unresolved.
Had the earlier, more moderate resolutions been implemented, most of those problems would have been resolved, and others might not have arisen. If today's resolutions are more militant, or strident in tone, the fault may not lie
exclusively with the authors of the resolutions. Those who, while haying it in their power to restrain or reform those States that have ignored their obligations under our Charter, have chosen not to exercise that power, must also share the responsibility. Their repeated failure to help us implement the expressed will of the international community has led to the situation they now abhor.
The occasional inability to be exact and concise in our various resolutions is, we agree, a serious and regrettable deficiency. However, it is a deficiency of form. On the other hand, actively frustrating the will of our international democracy in so many instances is a substantive shortcoming. That is even more regrettable.
There is no doubt that we should consider changes in some of our practices and procedures, and perhaps even in some aspects of the structure of the United Nations. However, we must be careful not, as the saying goes, 'to throw out the baby with the bath water'. Change and reform are two-way avenues. We cannot be expected to consider making some changes but not others. Nor can we reform the Organization without a willingness by most of our Members to modify their behavior and a willingness by other to reform themselves.
The report of the Group of High-Lev el Intergovernmental Experts is an important document. It is obvious that considerable thought and effort have been expended in its preparation. We commend the Group of 18 for its labor on our behalf. The conclusions of their report merit our careful consideration, as it is obvious that we have reached a critical stage in the history of this Organization and another very critical stage in the process of international co-operation.
This year, as in past years, we have been reminded of mankind's vulnerabilities and imperfections. In lands an geographically removed from each other as the Solomon Islands and the Cameroons, death and destruction have struck without warning, in the form of an unusually severe cyclone in one instance and of a volcanic gas leak in the other. It is almost as if nature had chosen those harsh methods of delivering a painful reminder of its mystery, its power and the fact that as individual nations we are all vulnerable.
In lands as politically remote from each other as the United States and the Soviet Union, two separate incidents involving imperfect technology and human miscalculation have caused major disasters that have.had an impact upon and traumatized people far beyond the borders of those two powerful States. The tragic explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the equally tragic accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant point to mankind's scientific imperfections and the very thin margin of error between scientific progress and disaster. In a related sense those two accidents also bring to mind the thin margin of error between the policy of nuclear deterrence and the potential accidental nuclear annihilation of the entire human race. They remind us that unless we work together no amount of technology can save our species from its own inventions.
How many more reminders will have to be given before an even greater disaster occurs? what further lesson do we peed? Must we see more evidence of the homicidal and suicidal nature of the nuclear-arms race or may we finally say that enough is not only enough but more than enough?
As President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev prepare for their second summit meeting we note the positive step evidenced by the recently concluded Stockholm accord. It is to be hoped that the flexibility demonstrated in the final stages of the negotiation of that accord and the trust and confidence evidenced in its terms will enable them to take further steps on the long road to a lasting and stable peace.
The establishment of trust and confidence in Europe is but one dimension of the world-wide search for peace. Trust and confidence in the process of multilateralism must also be evident in our work here at the united Nations, to ensure the continued relevance of the Organization and its value to future generations. Not one of our countries, large or small, East or West, North or South, can afford to denigrate this Organization in word or deed. We all need the United Nations. Some of us simply recognize that we need it more than others of us care to admit.
I now turn to southern Africa. That area, more than any other, tests the will and resolve of the international community. The late W. E. B. DuBois wrote in his most noted passage that 'the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line'. I doubt that this renowned historian, despite his wisdom and acumen, knew how prophetic those words would be. He was born in a society that had only recently ended its own form of legalized slavery. Racism was still prevalent in the land of his birth. Segregation was the accepted code of behavior. Africa, Asia and the Caribbean were colonized. The peoples of those regions were locked in the grip of those who saw them as mere subhuman producers of raw materials for their hungry factories.
A great deal has changed since his time. DuBois and others managed, through decades of difficult struggle, to overcome the segregationists and change the face and the soul of the land of their birth. Their children now know hope where before they knew only despair. Most of the countries of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean are, through the efforts of their respective peoples, now politically independent. Their children also know hope where once they knew only despair.
Unfortunately, South Africa is a land untouched by the passage of time. Despite its twentieth century technology, its people continue to be victims of the backward attitudes of the nineteenth century. Even in death South Africa's people are victimized. A few weeks ago, at a place called Evander, 177 human beings lost their lives in a gold-mine accident. That disaster could have been avoided but concern for the safety of African miners is not an attribute of South Africa. The company involved identified the five dead whites by name, occupation and marital status and gave details of how many children each had. The 172 dead blacks were identified only as members of different tribes. Even in death they were given no dignity. This was not South Africa's worst mining accident and it is not the worst example of the South African regime's inhumanity. It is, however, a good example of how pervasive that regime's racism is. Recent cosmetic changes are almost meaningless. Despite the efforts of some to paint a different picture, its intransigence and unwillingness to change in any substantive manner are as evident today as they were yesterday.
The apartheid regime is not content with terrorizing the people of South Africa. Its system has also been imposed on the people of Namibia and threatens the survival of each of the front-line States. That regime, in fact, challenges every member of the United Nations.
None of us could possibly accept such behavior in our own countries, why, then, do we still permit those storm troopers in Pretoria to call themselves a legitimate Government? Why do some of us still hesitate to align ourselves with the people who seek nothing more than the right to walk the land of their own country as free human beings? Why do same of us close our eyes to the fact that the Pretoria regime has already imposed sanctions on neighboring African States in an effort to make them betray their own principles and their own people? How can those who oppose sanctions claim to be motivated by concern for South Africa's black population when apartheid itself is nothing more than the institutionalization of sanctions against that same population? How much longer must the world wait for some finally to decide to join the battle against this evil? What degree of brutality and callousness will finally move them to action? Must we wait until the next century for their attitudes to catch up with those of this century?
Turning to our own area, the South Pacific, we draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that ours is a part of the world that contains many of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. We seldom fail to mention this, because nothing poses a graver threat to the stability and tranquility of our region and nothing is in greater contradiction of the Charter of the United Nations and its various pronouncements.
In the modern world colonialism is just as much an anachronism as apartheid. What could be more outdated than the notion that the people of any territory are incapable of deciding for themselves who they are, what they wish to be and how they choose to live? That is why the maintenance of colonialism in the midst of the South Pacific region is unacceptable. The States of our region speak with one clear voice on the subject. We are as convinced of this as are the States of other regions that colonialism has no place in their midst.
In August, the Heads of Government of the 13 member States of the South Pacific Forum decided to ask the United Nations to place New Caledonia on its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. That step had been considered in the past but had not been taken. In the past, the Forum countries believed that the administering Power recognized its responsibilities in the area of decolonization and that it would act accordingly. The events of the past year have now convinced us otherwise.
In September, the Heads of State or Government of the 101-member Movement of Non-Aligned Countries supported our regional initiative. At the eighth summit conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, the Heads of State or Government strongly urged the forty-first session of the General Assembly to place New Caledonia on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. They also admitted New Caledonia's independence movement, the Front de Liberation Nationale Ranak et Socialiste (FLNRS) as an observer. Vanuatu, having joined in those unanimous decisions, now anticipates that the General Assembly will itself take appropriate action.
He seek no quarrel with the administering Power and will not be provoked into one. If we are called names or if stones are cast in our direction we will not respond in kind. The principles involved are too lofty, our Charter is too explicit and the various resolutions are too clear for us to allow ourselves to be dragged into such a useless and senseless exercise.
We have been told that this is all our fault. How can that be so? It was not Vanuatu that colonized New Caledonia. It was not Vanuatu that drafted the Charter of the United Nations. It was not Vanuatu that was the author of the various resolutions on decolonization. It was not a representative of Vanuatu who first uttered the words 'liberty, equality, fraternity'.
We cannot take individual credit. Vanuatu is only one of 13 countries in the South Pacific For una, one of 99 countries and two liberation movements in the Hon-Aligned Movement and one of 159 coin tries in the United Nations.
On another day, we were told that Australia was to blame* on another day, it was New Zealand> on another, Fiji ; on yet another, Papua New Guinea; and on other days the Solomon Islands or Samoa. Everyone has been given credit for causing the case of New Caledonia to be brought to the united Nations except the one party which really deserves the credit; the administering Power. It chose not to proceed with what it had promised the colonized people of New Caledonia. Therefore it can blame no one but itself.
We have also been bold that economic aid to Vanuatu will be terminated if we persist in bringing the question of New Caledonia to the united Nations. This is a most unfortunate suggestion. Naturally we do not want to see this aid terminated. Vanuatu is, after all, a small developing country. In fact it is one of the least developed countries. However, we will not be intimidated in this way or in any other manner.
Similar threats have been made and carried out against other countries. Vanuatu is not the first and will probably not be the last to be threatened in this fashion. We regret this, but such is life. We have always believed that the administering Power is above such actions. We still hope that it is. However, if it is not, Vanuatu will survive, and New Caledonia will still become independent. Nothing will stop that process.
Finally, we were also told that the Political Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Coin tries was meaningless. 'They do not mean it,' we were told. 'They will change their minds when they get to the United Nations,' we heard.
We find it incredible that anyone should believe that the leaders of the non-aligned countries are not serious when they issue a political declaration. It is fathomable to us that anyone would believe that they do not mean what they say and say what they mean. How could anyone expect representatives of the non-aligned countries at the United Nations to act contrary to a clear and explicit declaration made by their Heads of state or Government?
More incredibly, how could anyone expect non-aligned Members of the United Nations to forget their own histories and reverse a unanimous summit decision on what is clearly a decolonization question? How could anyone expect any Member of the United Nations to say that the United Nations should not even consider a colonial question? How can anyone question the competence of the United Nations to consider this Batter? Who aiaong us is prepared to take the floor and express a lack of confidence in the fairness and objectivity of the decolonization process that we ourselves have established and that we ourselves monitor? Vanuatu would never ask any nation to do anything that is so patently at odds with its own principles and the Charter. we hope that France, the administering Power in New Caledonia, would not consider asking any nation to do such a thing.
Prance is still our friend, its representatives and its nationals are in all sincerity welcome in Vanuatu. We anticipate that they will also be welcome in an independent New Caledonia. We fully understand the political constraints and other difficulties facing France in New Caledonia due to the presence of a large settler population. It has faced similar constraints before, as have other administering Powers.
The independence movement and the countries of the region are anxious to work constructively with the French Government in the decolonization process. That is why we wish to have the United Nations play its customary role. What could be more reasonable?
Indonesia, our large and influential neighbor, is a country we respect. We have always admired its struggle to free itself from colonialism. Everyone knows that we have also on occasion disagreed with some of its policies in our area. Despite these areas of disagreement, Vanuatu has always considered itself a friend of Indonesia and always will.
On roost matters we concur. On a few we do not. However, we listen attentively to Indonesia's position on those subjects. We analyze what is said and carefully note the areas in which, as a matter of principle, we do not agree and those in which we do agree.
Nothing is static. Only evolution is a constant. We have never feared to let Indonesia know where we have disagreed. Similarly, we do not fear to let it know where we* agree. We do so today once again as a candid friend.
We are pleased by the ability of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to address some of the problems that have arisen along their border in a positive and conciliatory manner. As a Melanesian State sharing a rich cultural heritage with other Melanesian peoples, Vanuatu appreciates the measures taken to assure the survival of cultural diversity and ethnic pluralism in our region. We commend Indonesia and Papua New Guinea for the steps they have taken in this regard. Both deserve a great deal of credit and support for these initiatives and those to follow.
On East Timor, we support the Secretary-General's attempts to bring about an acceptable solution. His humanitarian efforts merit the support of the entire international community. The negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia are an encouraging sign. As we have always stated, we will support the genuine wishes of the people of the Territory, nothing more and nothing less.
R Ours is a monumental task. The United Nations is charged with considering and resolving major issues some of which seem in one form or another to have vexed mankind almost from the beginning of recorded history. There are still no easy answers or quick solutions to any of these issues.
Just as nature's process of creating oil or precious minerals took centuries of agitation and ferment of various elements, so too will the process of creating a better future take years of effort by every nation represented in this Hall, and
r-
some that are not yet represented here. We have begun that process. Let us continue it, and let us bequeath to future generations' the ability and the means to improve upon the humble efforts of this generation. .
"
1006,41,1986,AUS,"
My country, Australia, is delighted to see you, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, presiding over the forty-first session of the General Assembly. Coming from a major third-world country, you will bring special sensitivity to so many of the problems with which we shall be concerned during this session.
I should also like to express Australia's sincere appreciation to your predecessor, the former Permanent Representative of Spain, for his skill in presiding so effectively over the fortieth session of the General Assembly.
Australia has historical reasons to be conscious of the United Nations, of the grave responsibilities that it bears and the great hopes invested in it. Our nation was the first to have a permanent mission accredited to the United Nations in New York. An Australian was the first President of the Security Council. A predecessor of mine, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, was President of the Assembly in its third turbulent year. In this forty-first year of the united Nations Australia is reaching the end of its fourth term on the Security Council. It has been a period of high significance, both to the cause of global security and to the effectiveness of the Council itself.
There is another good reason why Australians have been more acutely aware than usual of these developments: 1986 is the International Year of Peace, and Australia has invested great resources into making it more than just a rhetorical event. The concept of peace - what it actually is, what obstacles stand in its way, what its maintenance asks of individual citizens - has been very much on our minds in the course of this year. Australians have reacted to the idea of the Year of Peace in an extraordinarily energetic and committed way, and at all levels in our community, from the most junior of school-children to the highest levels of government.
It is not hard to think of reasons for this degree of interest. Australia is in an area of the world which seems to be growing more attractive in the configurations of great-Power interests and forces. It is in an area which has known great stress from colonization and the winning of independence. It is in an area which has been - for whatever reason - a major killing field over the past 40 years or so.
It is true that Australians have been protected more than most from the worst effects of all this, but they have not been hidden from it. Anxiety about the threat - and even conviction about the inevitability - of nuclear war has been found to be widespread, especially among young people in Australia, as in other parts of the world. This is a terrible heritage to hand on. The early reality of people my age was economic insecurity, if not deprivation. That was bad enough.
The experience of young people these days is worse: of terrorism and assassination brought into their homes by television, children starving to death, nuclear explosion and threat. No wonder so many young people are found to be so cynical and pessimistic. They appreciate that - such is the state of the art of war - it needs only the tiniest miscalculation or mistake to set off events that can transform all life into instant archeology. They fear the consequences when distant, arcane and often seemingly trivial disagreement is taken up and used in the kind of ideological, nationalist or economic competitiveness that has set off two world wars so far this century.
Australians, like other normal people, yearn for an end to this insecurity. Their Government believes that the multilateral process, and this Organization particularly, offer the most effective ways to deal with the tensions and problems that disturb world peace. This forty-first session of the General Assembly in the International Year of Peace is an opportune moment to measure the durability of those tensions, and the problems and the efficacy of the multilateral way of solving them.
The most obviously urgent of these tensions is the instability caused by nuclear weapons. We are on the threshold of developments that could so change the nature of the strategic relationship that it could be many unstable years before the super-Powers are sufficiently confident once more to engage in productive negotiations. The Australian Government believes that it would be highly dangerous to stunt)le - as we risk doing - into the competitive development of ballistic missile defenses and an arms race in space. The discussions last November between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev gave significant impetus to the arms-control process: for instance, the agreement to accelerate negotiations and the call for early progress on matters where there was common ground, such as the principle of reductions in the nuclear arms of the United States and the USSR -appropriately measured - and the idea of an interim intermediate-range nuclear force agreement. Both super-Powers have now put forward a number of detailed proposals for reductions in their nuclear arsenals. Recent meetings have taken place between United States and Soviet arms-control experts. Mow we have the welcome announcement that President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will meet in Iceland next week.
The Australian Government hopes that these developments will pave the way for substantial negotiations and early agreement on deep reductions in offensive nuclear forces. We hope for agreement on practical arrangements and understandings on the issue of strategic defense and the future of the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. We hope that both sides can now show willingness on the issue of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, which the Australian Government considers a most urgent practical step on the road to nuclear arms control. It is in this context of multilateral action and agreement on forms of arms control that I draw attention to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, which the Australian Government supports as a significant step against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Australia also wishes to draw attention to the disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, which has provided the effective manner in which Antarctica has been managed in support of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We re-emphasize our commitment to the existing system for the management of Antarctica and, accordingly, we disagree on this matter with my good friend the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Australia was disappointed that the fortieth session of the General Assembly broke with the tradition of consensus on this issue. This was not due to the Consultative Parties, and we hope that that tradition can be restored at this forty-first session. The fact and the implications of nuclear arms understandably overshadow the issue of the trade in conventional arms. In the Australian Government's view, they should not be allowed to do so. Right now conventional weapons are being used to kill people in northern and southern Africa, Afghanistan, Central America and Cambodia.
It is a shameful fact that respectable Members of this Organization ace providing the weapons with which Iranians and Iraqis are killing each other. The Australian Government believes that countries contributing to such tragedies should be held accountable for doing so, as with pollution which crosses national borders. Members of the United Nations should agree not to export defense materials to nations engaged in military conflict or where the potential for conflict is high, or where it is likely to be used to suppress human rights. As a first step and at the very least, all States should release more information on their conventional arsenals and transfers, and subscribe to the Secretary-General's standardized reporting instrument on military expenditures so that a more accurate picture of the problem can be built up.
More than 80 per cent of the world's military expenditure - estimated at more than $US 900 billion a year and rising - goes on conventional weapons, outlays on conventional arms by developing countries are estimated as being roughly equal to the development assistance they get from developed countries. Brandt, Palme, the Panel of Eminent Personalities, the Secretary-General*, these are among a long list of authorities who have described the contradiction between the demands of militarization and the demands of development; that is, the waste of scarce human, capital and material resources on the arms race. Dwight Eisenhower was a leader in war and in recovery from war. He had good reason as President of the United states to warn that
'every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. The world is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. Thirty years later, the Thorssen report on the relationship between disarmament and development still saw the need to point out that the world can choose to pursue either the arms race or a more stable social and economic order. It cannot do both.
The logic cannot be challenged. Poverty, hunger and disease are major causes of social and political instability. They cannot be tackled effectively when scarce resources are being used for armaments. Experience shows that unrest leads to government repression in so many countries, leading to the spread of authoritarianism. It is no wonder that, in so many countries, democracy has come to be seen as a luxury, the dessert course of economically sound societies. If military spending is such an obviously important ingredient in the economic problems of developing countries, reduction in military spending is an obviously important ingredient in solutions to those problems.
As it is, developing countries particularly face grave economic difficulties from the plague of protectionism in world trade and the complicated and fragile issue of international debt adjustment. The World Bank has estimated that farm subsidies by members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1986 will total more than $US 100 billion. This is a policy that, if permitted to continue, will lead to ruin for agriculture-based economies. This, in the main, means the economies of developing countries, which have to make their way at a time when the international economy as a whole is undergoing difficulty, uncertainty and challenge. The Australian Government has been involved in the recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) discussions in Uruguay and elsewhere in the cause of fairer and freer trade. We hope that these discussions will continue so that the issues of trade subsidies, and particularly agricultural trade reform, can be dealt with on a basis which is fair and realistic. We also hope that the spirit that prevailed in Uruguay will continue to be applied to the other great problem for many developing countries: the scope and terms of their formidable debt. I should observe that the Australian Government supports the general thrust of the Baker proposals for solution of this problem. We also support the general approach of the International Monetary Fund to adjustment and conditionality, noting that it should continue to be handled with care. Democratic institutions, sometimes at delicate stages of development, should not be undermined by the process. The economic benefits of conditionality have to be balanced against their potential for causing distress and dislocation. There is not a lot of profit, either for debtors or for creditors, in encouraging economic activity in nations whose export markets are closed off by trade subsidization and other protectionist policies. On both the trade reform and debt adjustment issues, the lessons of the events of 50 or 60 years ago should be ominously clear; the results when nations refuse to co-operate can be devastating.
No solutions to great economic problems will work if they do not have the approbation and support of those who are affected by them. No order can endure unless those who are subject to it believe themselves to have a stake in it. This principle applies to other natters on the agenda of this Organization in which Australia has a special interest. It is why the Australian Government continues to condemn the occupation of Afghanistan. It is the reason for our continuing denunciation of Viet Nam's occupation of Cambodia and the atrocities committed in Cambodia by the leadership of the Khmer Rouge. Human freedoms and the agreement of the governed are at the heart of the divisions between the people of North and South Korea. The United Nations once went to war over these divisions. It seems only sensible that, by admitting both North and South Korea, the United Nations should promote the contact and dialog that will help heal those divisions.
Freedom and the agreement of the governed are highly significant factors in a matter which is of special concern to Australia and our Pacific neighbors: New Caledonia. Australia would like to see New Caledonia join the community of
independent nations in the South Pacific as soon as it is realistically possible, with a system of multiracial independence which recognizes the rights of the indigenous Kanak people and other long-term residents, and which maintains the support and good will of France - a point which I have made repeatedly to my good friends in the Kanak movement. Australia supports the call by South Pacific Forum countries for re-inscribing New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, and we and our South Pacific neighbors will work to do so at this session. We believe that it will facilitate progress towards self-government and independence, through constructive dialog with all parties involved, including the French Government, to be reviewed regularly by this Organization.
Freedom and participation are central also in two issues which concern Australia because of their capacity to threaten international peace. I refer to the continuing and deteriorating situations in South Africa and the Middle Bast. The Australian Government believes that the system by which South Africa is governed represents precisely that which the United Nations was designed to oppose; institutional inequity, injustice, violence, oppression and discrimination, it is surprising, therefore, that the South African situation has not been treated in all the statements made by members at this session so far as what it really is; a threat to fundamental United Nations values. The Australian Government's disgust with the system of government in South Africa and that country's continuing illegal occupation of Namibia is well known and needs no explanation here. We genuinely want to see apartheid eliminated quickly and peacefully before it plunges the region, and areas beyond, into wider conflict. Australia and other Commonwealth countries have tried to persuade South Africa to set such basic reform in train, but without success. We believe that the United Nations should set up a mandatory system of concerted and coherent sanctions which would pressure South Africa into real reform. Certainly those Members that cannot or will not adopt sanction policies should refrain or should be discouraged by this Organization from taking commercial advantage of those who can and will.
Already in this debate we have heard expressions of hope that some progress might be made in 1987 towards finding a solution of the intractable problems of the Middle East. As a country which has drawn new settlers from diverse parts of the Middle East, which contributes to United Nations peace-keeping efforts, which in simple human terms has not failed to be touched by the plight of refugees and the results of conflict and terrorism, Australia shares this hope. Progress can be made only if compromises and accommodations can be reached which take into account the rights and aspirations of all those involved.
The late President Roosevelt saw the United Nations as a replacement for exclusive alliances, spheres of influence and other failed expedients. At the time, on the one hand stood the untrammeled influence of the victorious Powers and, on the other, the dispossessed. It fell to the United Nations to try to fill the vacuum of authority between them. There are many who would say that that pattern has not changed in any substantial way. Certainly, the Australian Government sees the Organization as the only viable alternative to the authority that prevailed previously, very often to the great detriment of huge numbers of humankind - the power of the prevailing empire or State. Yet, despite this, and despite the fact that the world is at a stage in its history when fewer problems can be solved by national measures alone, confidence in international organizations seems to have lessened. Reliance on unilateral action seems more attractive to some people.
The Australian Government has some understanding of the impatience expressed about the United Nations and its operations. We would argue that there is room for more efficient administration of the Organization, less wasteful duplication of function and operation and a more rational decision-making process for its budget. In view of its high mission and the poverty and exploitation against which it is struggling, it is quite wrong that the United Nations should be in any way an example of conspicuous consumption. In view of the high expectations of it in every part of the world, it would be a shame if the United Nations were to degenerate into a broadcasting agency for pointless, meaningless and ultimately useless declarations. Australia is among the vanguard of those who seek to make the Security Council more effective. It should, be allowed to act more flexibly, for instance, to play more of a mediator or preventive role. It should be allowed to work more closely with the Secretary-General. I use the word 'allowed' deliberately, because it is clear that the Council is inhibited by two factors: the trend that has turned it into a kind of mini-General Assembly and the failure of its permanent members always to remember the greater responsibility that goes with their privileged position. Australia will assist the Secretary-General in his aim of making the United Nations a more effective Organization as energetically and as positively as it can.
It would be quite wrong to infer from this, however, that the Australian Government has any sympathy with those who act to diminish the United Nations itself and its various organizations. The United Nations has the firm support of the Australian Government. It should not be allowed to become the scapegoat because individual Members fail to subsume their national interests. As Dag Hammarskjold once said, that is like blaming the storm on the ship. The fact is, that the United Nations is no better or worse than the countries which control its purse-strings. If Member States have cause to quarrel with United Nations procedures or if large nations are frustrated because of the way small nations use the system, the solution is to stay and help the fight for sensible reform, not to walk away from the problem.
There are many thousands - even millions - of people who owe their shelter, their food, their schooling and even their survival to the organizations of the United Nations. The United Nations has achieved steady progress on a whole range of practical matters: environmental control, for instance*, conditions of work; literacy, the codification of law, the orderly management of transport and communications. It has been instrumental in winning and protecting individual and national freedoms. It has helped keep the peace between nations. It has promoted in people's consciousness an awareness of the gravity and potential for destruction of the great scourges of humankind: oppression of individuals, poverty and the wastage of resources, the causes of war. It has established and defended a moral climate for the conduct of international affairs. It has become the main platform and protector - for many people, the only platform and protector - of those
who feel strong as members of the international community but weak when left to operate alone.
I am not so unwise as to exaggerate Australia's influence on these matters, but I speak as the representative of a nation which feels strongly about threats to the capacity of the United Nations to maintain and defend the rights of individuals and nations in a just and effective world order. I reiterate the pledge given by the Australian Government at the fortieth session of the General Assembly of active, committed and profound loyalty to the United Nations and its ideals. Our Government feels very strongly that the Organization is in danger so long as it refuses or postpones reform, but it believes equally strongly that there is no substitute for the United Nations in a multilateral system of co-operative management of global problems and the maintenance of world peace.
"
1007,41,1986,PNG,"On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under your able leadership the work of this august body will be carried out with efficiency and success.
I should also likeP on behalf of my country, to register our sincere appreciation for the excellent work performed by your predecessor, Mr. de Pinies of Spain. In addition, let me add my Government's voice to those who have already spoken in praise of the work being done by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Javier Perez de Cueilar.
Papua New Guinea is situated in a part of the world which hears the name of peace - the Pacific Ocean. But we are no more immune to world-wide problems than are peoples in other parts of the world.
Governments in our region have been able to make modest, but none the less effective, contributions to the resolution of regional problems. But we remain vulnerable to other problems. In fact, the island States of the South Pacific are probably more vulnerable to some problems than are countries in other parts of the world.
The South Pacific is one of the few regions of the world where old-style colonialism is still to be found. People in our region look to people elsewhere for help and support in bringing colonialism to an end. We support people trying to free themselves from colonialism in other parts of the world.
Despite its peaceful-sounding name, the Pacific is not remote from the arms race. In fact, some parts of the region are used by a number of nuclear Powers for weapon testing and target practice.
The disarray in world commodity markets and the over-all decline in commodity prices affect us deeply.
Growing indifference to the problems of developing countries, expressed by what people in developed countries carelessly describe as aid fatigue, is having profoundly adverse effects on Government's capacity to provide services for our people and to improve living standards in the future.
The continuing failure by Governments in developed countries to address the issues raised by proposals, for a new international economic order makes even the modest goal of fiscal self-reliance, to which my Government is strongly committed, unnecessarily difficult to achieve.
This year, 1986, is the International Year of Peace. Under the United Nations Charter, all United Nations Members subscribe to peace. All of us say that we favor peace. But what have we really done to give effect to our common commitment?
The United Nations, formed in the aftermath of the Second World War, was intended by its founders to be a vehicle for securing peace - genuine and lasting peace. Its founders recognized, as the Charter shows, that such peace involves more than the absence of war. They saw that genuine and lasting international peace can come about only if we attend to the underlying causes of international conflict.
Inequity, the denial of basic human rights and the arms race are just as surely threats to peace as is naked military aggression.
Yet, year after year, leaders from all parts of the world stand in this Hall and speak in favor of peace, but little or nothing happens. In fact, international tensions are increasing. The United Nations is now more than a generation old.Can we, the next generation, do no more? Surely, we must - for ourselves, for our children and, if humanity is to survive, for their successors, too.
Papua New Guinea is a full, committed and - within the scope of available resources - active Member of the united Nations. For countries like mine, the United Nations is a vital - indeed, irreplaceable - means of securing national, regional and wider interests.
Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have always believed that we have a general interest in preserving and increasing international co-operation. We have a particular interest in supporting a strengthened united Nations system. We are therefore concerned at actions which have the effect of weakening or reducing participation in the work of the United Nations.
We urge other Governments to take careful heed of the Secretary-General's urgent warning regarding the financial state of the United Nations and to do what they can to help.
Limited though our capacity to influence events may be, my own and other Governments in our region are nonetheless determined to use what influence we have to give effect to the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter. We fully accept the obligations that arise from sovereign equality among the nations of the world.
My Government has thus recently concluded negotiating a treaty of mutual respect, friendship and co-operation with our closest neighbor, Indonesia. We believe that mutual respect is, and must be, the starting point of equitable and peaceful relations between sovereign States. Friendship and co-operation, the goals that all Members of the United Nations claim to share, must surely follow.
Together with the Governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, we have formed a spearhead group to monitor and act on issues of special concern to the Melanesian States. The spearhead symbolizes a united effort, not an aggressive weapon. The group does not threaten other countries or regional groups. It is strongly committed to wider forms of regional and international co-operation.
In January, my Government decided to accede to the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The decision gave practical expression to our active commitment to vital and universal humanitarian
principles. We are already receiving some assistance from the office of the united Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Despite successive united Nations resolutions calling for arms control and eventual disarmament, the arms race continues apace. My Government is pleased at the decision to hold a summit meeting between the leaders of the two super-Powers. We are hopeful of a positive result. We are dismayed, however, at the over-all lack of progress being made towards arms control, not to speak of complete disarmament. The nuclear arms race threatens not only the main contestants, but all other countries.
Even if the ultimate horror of nuclear war can he averted, the destruction caused by the diversion of so much money, energy and talent away from the urgent problems of human suffering and development can only be described as obscene.
My Government inevitably gives a high priority to the security situation in our immediate region, but we are not indifferent to events and situations elsewhere. We therefore continue to urge all concerned in the Middle East to reach an equitable and peaceful solution to their problems consistent with the right of Israel to exist and with recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. We urge Governments in the region to work in a constructive way to resolve common problems, we also urge all those concerned to work towards the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.
My Government continues to be horrified at the terrible cost in human life and physical destruction caused by the war between Iran and Iraq. Here, surely, is an issue which goes to the heart of our common commitment to peace.
Foe obvious reasons, Papua New Guineans are concerned with the rights of peoples in small States. Bar equally obvious reasons, we can only deplore the continuing loss of human life and the waste of resources caused by failure to respect those rights. We therefore reaffirm our opposition to the continuing Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea. We are pleased to note that there may be signs of movement on the issue. We urge all parties to pay close attention to the constructive proposals put forward by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for dealing with the issue.
We also continue to deplore the ongoing occupation of Afghanistan by the armed forces of the Soviet Union. To our east, we urge all countries with interests in Central America to pay close heed of the efforts being made by the Contadora Group to bring peace and
stability to the region.
My Government looks to the Governments of North and South Korea to work towards peaceful reunification. We support the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations.
In line with one of the deepest commitments of our foreign policy, we urge Governments in all parts of the world to show respect for the rights of independent countries of all sizes to be free from unwanted external interference.
We call for greater co-operative efforts to deal with the causes of terrorism in the world and to counter inter national crime.
Like other peoples who have experienced colonial rule, we Papua New Guineans not only value our country's independence but believe strongly that colonized peoples are entitled to their independence. Our conviction is, we know, consistent with the views expressed in numerous United Nations resolutions. Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have always supported such resolutions.
Decolonization in the South Pacific has generally been peacefully achieved. The Governments and peoples of the former colonial Powers have remained actively involved in the region as aid donors, investors, trading partners and members of the South Pacific Commission.
My Government is therefore all the more concerned at the direction that events in New Caledonia seem to be taking. Other Governments in the region are equally concerned. Since 1984, more than 2 0 people in New Caledonia, most of them members of the Melanesian Kanak population, have been killed by members of the French armed forces or by French settlers. Many others have been injured, even in the last few weeks. The previous French Government had, we believe, begun to react to the worsening situation in a serious and positive way.
Delegations will be aware of the decision made by the 13-member South Pacific Forum, the paramount regional organization in the South Pacific, to call for the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The recent summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Move men t at Harare, Zimbabwe, strongly supported the South Pacific Forum's decision to call for self-determination and the early transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the rights and aspirations of the indigenous people,' that is, the Kanaks.
We are pleased to note the strong support expressed by a number of Governments during this session for the just struggle of the Kanaks for independence in New Caledonia. All of us who are concerned with the situation in New Caledonia look to the General Assembly for support to re-inscribe New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories during this session of the General Assembly.
The South Pacific area contains many - indeed, all too many - of the world's remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories, as was noted at the Non-Aligned Movement's summit meeting. France is not only the major remaining colonial Power in our region; it is unashamedly and insensitively so. The Government of France seems to regard the South Pacific as little more than a useful site for testing weapons and a backdrop for the expression of its residual imperial aspirations.
fty Government, like other Governments in the region, welcomes and appreciates the constructive role that the French and other Western European Governments play in our region through the Lome Convention and in other ways. But France is not a South Pacific country. New Caledonia is not a part of France. To suggest that either is the case, as the French Government does, is a delusion.
New Caledonia is. by all criteria, a colony of France. So is the area the French Government persists in referring to as 'French Polynesia.' And so, too, are Wall is aid FVituna. The indigenous people of New Caledonia are not the same as Metropolitan Frenchmen. The Kanaks are Mslanesians. They speak and act through the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the FLNKS. Against ail reason, the French Government persists in regarding New Caledonia as part of France. It ignores the Kanaks. Where it cannot ignore them, it tries to silence them. It denies them opportunities for advancement. The French Government is generally indifferent and even hostile to the legitimate rights of the Kanaks. It intimidates the Kanaks. It actively supports the Kanaks' present and potential oppressors.
In flagrant defiance of paragraph 8 of the Annex to United Nations General Assembly resolution 35/118, the French Government continues to import Frenchmen from metropolitan France into New Caledonia. It is engaged in a military build-up of such proportions that the French military presence in New Caledonia is approximately twice as large as the entire armed forces of all Forum island countries combined. There is now an armed French soldier for every two Melanesian Kanak families in New Caledonia. And the soldiers sent to New Caledonia to suppress the FINKS are entitled to vote in local elections, as are other short-term residents from metropolitan France.
Through a combination of hostile propaganda, intimidation and active military intervention, the French Government seems determined to deny the legitimate rights of the Kanaks - rights which are theirs under the United Nations Charter.
We find it deeply and sadly ironic that the Government of a country which has itself experienced the dreadful agonies of unprovoked terrorist attacks on innocent civilians is itself directly engaged in bringing terror to our region.
My Government believes that we would be failing in our duty to the Kanaks and to the principles for which we stand if we did not bring the situation in New Caledonia before the General Assembly. The United Nations, which has played a vital role in the peaceful decolonization of the South Pacific, will lose credibility throughout the region if it does not respond promptly, decisively and effectively to the situation.
The re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories is but a modest step. It threatens no one. It will, we hope, arouse the Government and people of France to a true appreciation of the wider implications of their actions and stimulate awareness of their true responsibilities and long-term interests in the region.
In line with the strong stance that we have taken on New Caledonia, we support other calls for self-determination by peoples still subject to colonial rule elsewhere. In particular we support the legitimate right of the Namibian people to be free from South African oppression.
Papua New Guinea's opposition to the vile principles and repellent practices of apartheid is a matter of public record. We deplore not only apartheid itself but the mounting cost in human dignity, life and property being paid by the African community as a result of the increasingly desperate attempts being made by the evil regime in Pretoria to maintain apartheid. We urge all Governments with a capacity to influence events in South Africa to use that influence to bring apartheid to an end. We condemn the Pretoria regime's repeated, unprovoked and flagrantly  illegal armed attacks on neighboring countries.
As I indicated at the outset, my Government deplores the slew progress being made towards arms control and disarmament, especially in regard to weapons of mass destruction. We are totally opposed to nuclear-weapon testing in the atmosphere. We therefore repeat our earlier protests against continuing French nuclear-weapon testing in our region.
Like most French people. Pacific Islanders do not want our children to have to breathe air, to drink water or to eat food which has been contaminated by nuclear pollution. People in our region have first-hand experience of nuclear-weapon testing that was supposed to be safe. They have injuries to show that it is not.
We simply cannot accept that the French Government or any other nuclear Power has the right to continue testing nuclear weapons in our region. If it so safe, let them test at home.
The South Pacific Forum has recently agreed to establish a Pacific nuclear-free zone under the Treaty of Rarotonga. The Treaty represents modest progress on a difficult subject.
My Government calls for further and more comprehensive consultation on measures which will make the South Pacific truly free from the hazards of nuclear contamination
We live in a world in which the economic circumstances of the developed countries have profound effects on the welfare and development prospects of developing countries. The point is made with some force in the latest editions of World Economic Outlook, prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Trade and Development Report, of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We nay live in one world, but economic power, at least, remains remarkably one sided.
My Government welcomed the historic special session of the United Nations General Assembly special session devoted to the economic crisis in Africa. We support moves to deal with the crisis. But we must not forget that hunger, the debt crisis and instability in commodity markets are world-wide phenomena with world-wide effects.
Proposals for a new international economic order have been on the agenda of this Assembly and other international organizations since well before Papua New Guinea became independent* The need for progress is at least as urgent now as it was when the proposals were first formulated. But little, if anything, has happened.
Some modest improvements have been made on a regional, and even on a multi-regional, basis. The contribution being made to North-South co-operation by the Lome Convention is an example. My Government is also impressed by the valuable economic and other benefits being reaped by people in South East Asia as a result of regional co-operation among the member States of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). We welcome the increasing interest being taken in the South Pacific by ASEAN members both individually and collectively. In the South Pacific, ray own Government and other Governments have been actively pressing for greater attention to be given to the existing structure of, and to the need to restructure, relations in the region. We have been particularly active in seeking the creation of a single regional organization. The concept of having a single regional organization for the South Pacific is important to us, not only because we seek to rationalize the activities of existing organizations but because we want to bring about a mare creative co-operative relationship between developed and developing countries in the region.
We can no longer accept the colonial-type assumptions implicit in the constitution, the structure and the activities of the South Pacific Commission.
We do not want to prevent Governments or other interested parties in metropolitan countries from playing a constructive role in our region, as I have said. But we are opposed to great-Power rivalry in the South Pacific. We cannot accept foreign domination.
We note the increasing interest the Government of the Soviet Union is talking in our region. We value the increasing contacts between ASEAN and Forum countries.
We look to the United States Government to play a positive role in resolving outstanding difficulties between the American Tuna-Boat Association and Forum countries over fisheries in the reqion.
We hope that the French Government will be responsive to international concern over its activities in the South Pacific.
We look forward to the day when a single regional organization can provide a framework and a means for constructive co-operation, based on sovereign equality and mutual respect, among all Governments with interests in the region. Such an organization will, my Government hopes, address a wide range of North-South issues on a regional basis: aid, trade, investment and other forms of mutual assistance.
The Governments of Australia and New Zealand are already engaged in wide-ranging dialog on a variety of economic and other matters with Forum island countries. We would like to see other countries become more constructively involved in the region too. Development assistance should be replaced by development co-operation. My Government is currently discussing practical proposals on the matter with the Government of Australia. We would like, in time, to see the range of issues and the number of participants expanded.
The Melanesian spearhead group has already taken steps to increase joint efforts to stem the flow of illegal narcotics into and through the reqion. Again, we would like to see our efforts taken up on a wider basis.
The South Pacific is, mercifully, peaceful, not only in name but, when compared with other, more troubled, parts of the world, quite peaceful in actuality. The people of the region want it to remain so. Our independence must be respected. Forum island countries need assistance in developing our natural resources and human potential so that we can become truly self-reliant. Our relations with other countries must be restructured in accordance with the principles of the united Nations Charter.

"
1066,57,2002,NZL,"﻿Mr. President, may I
begin by congratulating you on your assumption of the
presidency and assure you of New Zealand's
cooperation during your term of office.

The opening of this, the fifty-seventh session of
the General Assembly, came just one day after the
anniversary of the terrorist attack of 11 September
2001, which shocked this city and the international
community. The premeditated and callous mass murder
of 3,000 people from 79 different countries was a sharp
warning to us of the ongoing threats to peace and
stability in our world. It was to protect humanity
against such threats that the nations of the world came
together in 1945 to establish this Organization in the
belief that collective action was necessary to guarantee
global peace.
Today, in the second year of a new millennium,
the need to act multilaterally is greater than ever
before. Terrorism, weapons of mass destruction,
environmental degradation, people-smuggling, drug-
trafficking, diseases such as HIV/AIDS and the
unsustainable depletion of our natural resources are all
global matters that require a collective response.
We can be proud that a year ago the response by
the United Nations to a new and unprecedented level of
terrorism was immediate, united and effective. The
primary victim of the attack, the United States, sought
and secured international cooperation that achieved the
incapacitation of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization
and the removal of the Taliban regime that had hosted
it. It was a model for international unity of purpose and
multilateral action. It was a lesson that should not be
forgotten as this Organization tackles other problems
confronting humanity.
New Zealand has worked wholeheartedly under
the mandate provided by the United Nations to defeat
terrorism. We have introduced legislation to deny
terrorist organizations funding and resources in line
with Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We have
sought to assist our neighbours in the Pacific to do the
same. We have committed peacekeeping personnel to
the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and
combat forces under Operation Enduring Freedom in
Afghanistan. But we are also aware that actions to
suppress terrorism must be accompanied by measures
to tackle the causes of terrorism. Injustice, lack of
opportunity, hopelessness, desperation and the failure
of legitimate channels to redress grievances all give
rise to resort to terrorist actions.
The failure to resolve differences between Israeli
and Palestinian people in the Middle East continues to
be a catalyst for recruitment into terrorism. The
Secretary-General, in opening this session, spelled out
the basis for resolving the dispute. He referred to land
for peace, an end to terror and to occupation, and to
two States, Israel and Palestine, with secure and
recognized borders. Both peoples are destined to live
side by side. Both will benefit from an end to violence
and a negotiated settlement. But agreement requires
good faith from each side and a determined effort by
the international community. We fully endorse the
Secretary-General's renewed call for an international
peace conference. Progress on this issue is now more
vital than ever.
The situation in Iraq is also a threat to world
peace, but we must look for solutions that will resolve
and do not exacerbate that threat. No nation can be
exempt from the requirement to comply with the
resolutions passed by this Organization. That is
necessary if the rule of law is to apply internationally.
No nation can be allowed to commit aggression or to
use weapons of mass destruction against its own
people. The requirement to comply with United
Nations resolutions is not the instruction of one
country to Iraq; it is collective instruction that should
have the unanimous endorsement of all Member
countries.
Iraq's non-compliance with Security Council
resolutions is a challenge to the entire United Nations
membership. The United Nations must meet this
challenge. How the situation is resolved matters to us
all, not least the countries of the region itself.
Those who can exercise influence over Iraq
should do so to avoid the need for resort to other
actions. The response chosen by the Security Council
must, however, take into account the need not to
impose further costs on ordinary Iraqi people innocent
of any wrongdoing. The response should not involve
actions that undermine, rather than strengthen, the war
against terrorism.
The United Nations has shown that collective
action can save lives and help rebuild nations. We will
soon welcome the world's newest nation, East Timor,
into the United Nations, and we should celebrate the
success of the United Nations peacekeeping mission
and Transitional Administration in that country. I
congratulate Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Secretary-
General's former Special Representative, on his role,
and I thank those countries that contributed so much to
14

giving hope and opportunity to the people of that small
country.
New Zealand has had a battalion of peacekeepers
deployed in East Timor since September 1999, and also
has peacekeepers serving in 12 other countries. We are
proud that they have performed their role with
professionalism and respect for the people in whose
countries they operate. Notwithstanding the small size
of our population, New Zealand currently is the
twenty-second-largest contributor to the United
Nations peacekeeping personnel.
The promotion of human rights is another area
where multilateral action by the international
community is essential. In the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and in the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations has set
out universal standards for the observance of human
rights. There is no justification for any country to
deviate from those human rights standards. It is a mark
of shame that States Members of this Organization
continue to breach basic human rights and a disgrace
that other countries too often act as apologists for the
offending regimes.
An important landmark in the last year has been
the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court. As the culmination of
longstanding efforts by non-governmental
organizations, Governments and the international
community as a whole, it offers the prospect of
bringing justice to the victims of the most horrific
crimes known to humankind and bringing their
perpetrators to justice. It will serve as a deterrent where
none has existed before. We have listened carefully to
those who argue that the Court is not necessary and
that it unduly jeopardizes their peacekeepers, but we
cannot agree. The status quo, relying on domestic
jurisdiction alone, has failed humankind throughout
history and has borne witness to appalling crimes. The
new regime has carefully built-in safeguards to protect
the innocent.
We were dismayed by the actions of the Security
Council in July. At that time, we challenged both the
legitimacy and the substance of the Council's action.
We do not believe that it was consistent with the Rome
Statute or that the Council is able to arrogate to itself
the power to change treaty relationships.
A further issue on which greater progress must be
made is that of disarmament. The fact that humanity
survived the nightmare of potential nuclear destruction
during the cold war cannot be allowed to make us
complacent about ongoing threats from weapons of
mass destruction.
We welcome the Treaty of Moscow and the
agreement between Russia and the United States to cut
the number of strategic nuclear weapons each country
deploys. These reductions, however, are not a
substitute for irreversible cuts in, and the total
elimination of, those weapons.
In some respects even greater danger is posed by
short-range tactical nuclear weapons. There is a real
risk that these could be launched by accident or in
confusion, with no time available for communication
between opposing sides.
Over the last year, two significant events have
made our world a most dangerous place. The first is the
emergence of international terrorist groups that have
shown their willingness to use weapons of mass
destruction — biological, chemical or nuclear —
should they gain access to them.
The second is the situation in South Asia, where
the world recently came close to direct conflict
between two countries with nuclear capability. The
international community has not done enough to reduce
those risks.
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has
not been brought into effect. Progress towards the
implementation of undertakings made by nuclear-
weapon States at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review
Conference has stalled. Nations have not taken
sufficient steps to stop the production of fissile
material and to reduce stocks.
In this and in many other areas much more needs
to be done to address growing problems that affect all
of us. The awful toll of HIV/AIDS, slowness in
response to global warming and the growth in the
smuggling and trafficking of people are but three
further examples.
It is essential that we renew our commitment to
multilateralism as the best way to address global
problems. That requires not simply money but, must
importantly, political will. It is not a case of putting
global interests ahead of national interests. Global
15

interests are national interests. The United Nations is
our most valuable international organization, but we
need to do more to enhance its relevance, value and its
unique authority. All of us are stakeholders in its
success.







"
1079,57,2002,PNG,"﻿On
behalf of the people and the Government of Papua New
Guinea, I join previous speakers in congratulating you,
Sir, on your election as President of the fifty-seventh
session of the General Assembly. Your election to the
helm of the Assembly shows the high esteem in which
the international community holds you and your
country, the Czech Republic.
I take this opportunity to express my delegation's
sincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Han
Seung-soo of South Korea, for his outstanding
stewardship of the work of the fifty-sixth session of the
General Assembly. I also wish to place on record my
Government's deep appreciation to the Secretary-
General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his
continuing strong leadership and immense diplomatic
skill in dealing with many pressing international issues
which confront us today.
Papua New Guinea welcomes and congratulates
the newest State Member of the United Nations,
Switzerland, and looks forward to the accession to
membership of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.
Papua New Guinea acknowledges the political
will and wisdom shown by all parties — the Republic
of Indonesia, Australia, Portugal and the United
Nations — in respect of East Timor. We also praise the
people of Switzerland for their collective decision to
formally join the United Nations.
With the election of a new Government in my
country, our Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir
Michael Somare, recently made a nationwide address
detailing some of the challenges facing our economy
and what is required to put it back on the path to
recovery. He identified specific areas and sectors where
remedial measures are needed.
Domestically, our capacity to meet these
challenges and worthy goals is lacking. The problem is
further exacerbated and our capacity further
undermined by poor governance, incompetent
economic management, a rise in corruption, and
diminished public confidence in political leadership
and in the fundamentals of representative government.
The new Government of Papua New Guinea is
determined to chart a new course by addressing these
problems.
There have been specific initiatives taken to
enhance trade, investment and economic prospects. The
Pacific countries members of the African, Caribbean
and Pacific Island Group of States (ACP), together
with the African and Caribbean member States, are
now in the process of pursuing negotiations with the
European Union for possible economic partnership
agreements.
Recently, I announced the direction of our
Government's foreign policy focus. I stated that the
27

policy must be underpinned by the development and
strengthening of core relations in the Asia-Pacific
region.
We intend to consolidate relations with our close
neighbours and give more emphasis to the promotion
of trade and economic cooperation, investment, and
education and training.
As a small island developing country, and as an
affected member of the global village, my country fully
endorses the declarations and plans of action adopted at
recent world conferences. We believe that international
conferences such as the Doha, Monterrey and
Johannesburg summits and their plans of action are
blueprints to resolve many of the pressing global
challenges and needs, including poverty eradication;
sustainable development; environmental degradation
and climatic changes; and social ills, including HIV/
AIDS and other preventable diseases. They also echo
the voices of the majority of the world's population
living in poverty and struggling to overcome the
biggest challenge of all — how to survive.
These declarations and plans of action are a
further amplification of the historic Millennium
Declaration and its Development Goals, signed by all
our heads of State and Government in September 2000.
The challenge is to forge new global partnerships
for change — partnerships in which both developed
and developing countries join together to address the
issues that the global community will face in this new
millennium. These partnerships also include
international financial institutions, intergovernmental
organizations, the private sector, non-governmental
organizations, and civil society.
These partnerships will be necessary if the shared
hopes of humanity for peace and security, sustainable
development and a better way of life for all are to be
realized.
Papua New Guinea has been faced with an
internal conflict in our province of Bougainville for the
last decade. Like all previous Governments, the current
Government will continue to address the continuing
peaceful resolution of this conflict as a matter of
priority.
Papua New Guinea would like to take this
opportunity to express its appreciation to the United
Nations for its role in resolving this crisis. The conflict
has, in fact, involved substantial commitments of
personnel and funds by the United Nations,
neighbouring countries and Governments, including
our own.
I would like also to place on record our
appreciation to the Governments of Australia, New
Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu for contributing financial
and manpower resources to the Regional Peace
Monitoring Group to restore peace and security to the
island.
In addition, on the recommendations of the
Secretary-General, and in close cooperation between
the Papua New Guinea Government and the
Bougainville parties, the Security Council approved the
expansion of the role of the United Nations Political
Office in Bougainville in monitoring and assisting in
the arms collection, storage and disposal, under the
new Bougainville Agreement.
I am happy to report that the first and second
stages of the arms disposal programme are progressing
well; however, more remains to be done.
Our partners from Australia, New Zealand, the
European Union, Japan, and the United Nations
Development Programme continue to provide resources
for restoration and development work. A number of
non-governmental organizations, including churches
and the Red Cross, have also been active.
Changing the world from a system of relations
between imperial Powers to a partnership between
sovereign States through decolonization is among the
greatest achievements of the United Nations in the last
century. The process will not be completed, as it must
be, until the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing
Territories have exercised their inalienable right to self-
determination.
Our Organization should continue to monitor
developments in New Caledonia, Tokelau and the other
14 Non Self-Governing Territories on the United
Nations decolonization list, on a case-by-case basis.
Neither small size nor remoteness nor population
density should be allowed to qualify or limit the
exercise of this inalienable right. The Pacific Islands
Forum Leaders' Meeting, held last month in Fiji, once
again reaffirmed its support for this principle.
The Pacific Islands Forum Group, with the
exception of Australia and New Zealand, comprises of
small island countries that are custodians of the largest
ocean space. This ocean is rich in natural marine
28

resources. The countries of the region, however, have
limited human, financial and technological capacities
to control, manage, and secure those resources for the
benefit of our current and future generations.
The recent Pacific Islands Forum adopted the
Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy, which aims to
ensure the future sustainable use of our oceans and
their resources by our island communities and external
partners.
The Pacific Islands peoples have not received
their equitable share of the benefits resulting from the
tapping of natural resources within their vast ocean
space. For example, statistics showed that, in the year
2000, the value of fishery in the Central and Western
Pacific was in excess of $2.5 billion per annum, but the
Pacific countries earned a meagre $66 million in
licensing fees. This situation needs to be reviewed and
changed.
More than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans
live in rural villages, where they depend directly on the
land, rivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood.
Our National Constitution commits the nation to
conserve, use, and develop the rich variety of the
country's natural resources for the common good and
benefit of future generations. Papua New Guinea has
therefore spoken out strongly and worked actively on a
wide range of environmental issues.
Like other members of the Pacific Islands Forum,
Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to the
Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable
Development of Small Island Developing States. We
strongly urge its full implementation.
Papua New Guinea, together with other small
island developing States, continues to reiterate deep
concerns about the adverse impacts of climate change,
climate variability and sea-level rise, particularly with
regard to the small, low-lying islands that are already
experiencing extreme hardships. We will therefore
continue to stress the urgent need for the developed
countries to take a strong lead in the reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions.
Consistent with this, Papua New Guinea has
signed and ratified both the United Nations Climate
Change Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. We
believe that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward
for Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under
the Climate Change Convention. We urge those parties
to translate their legally binding targets into concrete
actions for the reduction of their gas emissions.
We welcome the support for the Kyoto Protocol
by Japan, the European Union and, more recently,
China and Russia. We urge the United States and
Australia to join the global efforts towards addressing
this issue, including ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.
Pacific Forum island leaders also reiterated
continuing serious concerns over the shipment of
radioactive materials through the region. They called
on those States engaging in these activities to accept
full responsibility and liability for compensation for
any damage that may result, directly or indirectly, from
the transport of radioactive material through the region.
Global warming has brought an increase in the
number of cases of diseases like malaria in the higher-
altitude regions of our country. This is still a major
threat to Papua New Guinea, particularly in the most
populous region — the highlands.
Papua New Guinea is not immune to the HIV/
AIDS epidemic, and tuberculosis is again on the rise,
so there is an urgent need to find preventative measures
for these diseases.
In this regard, we welcome announcements by the
Governments of Japan and the United States, among
other, that they would set aside substantial financial
resources for eradication programmes in developing
countries. Papua New Guinea concurs with the recent
calls by the international community to reform and
restructure the charters and mandates of the two
Bretton Woods institutions: the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. These two institutions
must realign their policies and focus more on
development and poverty eradication, rather than on
the reconstruction of economies.
Their lending policies should be made more
lenient and flexible in assisting the developing
countries, including small islands, landlocked and the
least developed countries. The ultimate goal must be to
transfer resources into the hands of the needy, the
marginalized and the ostracized of society, so that they
can take pride in the ownership of the outcomes of new
initiatives taken in their own countries.
The way forward was agreed to under the
Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable
Development of Small Island States and Agenda 21
and in the recent conferences on landlocked developing
29

countries and the Third United Nations Conference on
the Least Developed Countries in Brussels.
I must however underline that to date, we have
observed a lack of effective implementation of both the
Barbados Programme of Action and Agenda 21. There
has also been little or no increase in the international
aid and development assistance given to the developing
countries to build necessary infrastructure, human
resource capacities, and other basic needs. This, in our
humble view, has to change if the developing countries,
especially the small island developing States,
landlocked and the least developed countries are to
attain sustainable growth and development.
There is an urgent need to reform and restructure
the United Nations General Assembly and its
subsidiary bodies and agencies, as well as the Security
Council and the Economic and Social Council, so as to
reflect the recent dynamics and changes.
The Security Council should be reformed and
expanded in both categories, permanent and non-
permanent. It must take into account the interests of
both the developed and developing countries.
Although we are encouraged by the general
positive signs of progress towards resolving conflicts
and securing peace in several regions of the world,
Papua New Guinea remains concerned at the
continuing conflict in the Middle East. We believe
violence will not resolve the conflict. We call on both
Israel and the Palestinian leadership to come to the
negotiating table to discuss outstanding issues with the
view to resolving the conflict peacefully.
It would be remiss of me if I did not make
mention of the fact that 11 September 2002 marked the
first anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the United
States of America. The Government and people of
Papua New Guinea express to the Government and
people of the United States, and the families of the
victims drawn from many countries, our sympathy for
the tragedy and suffering of just a year ago, when
terrorism struck this great city of New York and
Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.
Though distant from this tragic event, we share in
the deep sorrow felt around the world, and in the
admiration of the extraordinary bravery and sacrifice of
so many who engaged themselves in the rescue efforts.
Our thoughts are with those who continue to mourn.
Papua New Guinea joins with all the freedom
loving nations and peoples of the world in condemning
terrorism in all its evil forms. Terrorist attacks can
never be justified. Terrorism, in which the lives of the
most innocent and vulnerable are so senselessly taken,
must be especially condemned.
Papua New Guinea fully endorses and supports
all efforts towards the effective implementation of the
United Nations Security Council resolution 1373
(2001).
You concluded your opening address to this
Assembly, Mr. President, by appealing to Member
States to focus on what we have in common — and
especially our desire to live in a peaceful and secure
world where the values and principles expressed in the
United Nations Charter are honoured. Papua New
Guinea shares your vision and the confidence that
underpin your address.
If the nations of the world — with our great
diversity — focus on what we have in common, we
will build and secure a better world, one in which the
benefits of economic development are shared, and one
in which the marvels of modern science and
technology, including modern medicine, are harnessed
for the common good of humanity. But none of these
things can be achieved without a genuine and lasting
peace.
In conclusion, I want to reaffirm Papua New
Guinea's firm commitments to what I have outlined
and reiterate that global, regional and local
partnerships in promoting sustainable development is
the key to addressing the challenges that confront the
world today.




"
1082,57,2002,NRU,"﻿I bring warm greetings from
the people of Nauru, who join me in congratulating
you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, and in
commending the outgoing President for his strong
leadership and guidance throughout the tumultuous
year gone by.
My delegation takes this opportunity to
congratulate Switzerland on becoming a full member
of the United Nations, making it the 190th Member
State in this brotherhood of nations.
Much of the work of the United Nations since the
last session of the General Assembly is reflective of the
state of the world. The events of 11 September 2001
and the ongoing conflicts around the world have
focused the work of this body on security issues, and
that is understandable. The Security Council's adoption
of its resolution 1373 (2001), obligating Member States
to implement anti-terrorism measures, has the full
support of the countries of the Pacific Island Forum, of
which we are a member.
At the international level, my Government is
pleased with the outcome of the first session of the
Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court, which concluded only a
few days ago.
We commend with admiration the United Nations
operation in East Timor for successfully nursing an
occupied territory and its people from despair to
nationhood, with the proclamation of an independent
Democratic Republic of East Timor on 20 May this
year.
The communiqué of the 33rd meeting of the
Pacific Islands Forum, held in Fiji last month, sets out
23

wide-ranging concerns that impact the livelihood and
welfare of the peoples of the Pacific. First and foremost
among those concerns is the environment. The
continued degradation of the Earth's environment
cannot be ignored, in the light of the natural disasters
that are occurring in different parts of the world:
flooding, earthquakes and droughts, to name but a few.
There is enough scientific evidence to show that the
changes in the Earth's environment and climate are
human-induced. The World Summit on Sustainable
Development recently held in Johannesburg was an
earnest attempt by us to remedy the situation.
All of us in the Pacific region were disappointed
by the lack of meaningful targets in the Johannesburg
Plan of Implementation. However, we believe that the
commitments for significant new resources and
partnerships reached at the Summit will go a long way
in helping to accelerate implementation of sustainable
development.
Nauru is very pleased by the assured entry into
force of the Kyoto Protocol, thanks to the commitments
made by India, Canada, Russia and China to ratify that
instrument. But that is only the first step in what has to
be a universal campaign to address climate change. We
would therefore join the call for the United States and
Australia to see their way clear, in the not-too-distant
future, to ratifying the Protocol.
Another issue of special importance to Nauru is
the health of our ocean. We are the custodians of the
largest ocean, rich in natural marine resources and
minerals. The ocean also frames our cultures and is the
source of our future well-being. This is particularly
true in the case of Nauru, which has a land area of only
10 square miles and an ocean area of at least 120,000
square miles. We use the ocean to provide desalinated
water, and earn a substantial amount of our income
from fishing license fees. For the sake of our future,
the international users of our ocean space must work
with us to conserve the ocean's natural resources
against unsustainable use; protect its biodiversity from
pollution, including through the shipment of toxic
materials; and ensure that island countries benefit
equitably from the trade in the ocean's natural
resources, living or non-living.
Just as the economies and the environment of
Pacific Islanders are vulnerable to external forces, so is
the security of our peoples and Governments. Our
region, the world's very first nuclear-free zone, has a
long history of supporting disarmament and the non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons, born of the region's
harsh experience with nuclear testing by colonial
powers.
I joined other Pacific Leaders last month in
expressing concern on the trans-shipment of nuclear
waste through our waters. My delegation welcomes the
initiative by Mongolia to institutionalize its territory as
a nuclear weapon-free zone and will support United
Nations action towards the realization of this goal.
On the domestic front, the potential fallout on our
economy of the OECD initiative on harmful tax
competition is worrisome, to say the least. While my
Government reaffirms the sovereign right of nations to
establish domestic tax regimes of their own design and
choosing, we have expressed our strong commitment to
developing a cooperative framework within which
countries can work together to address transparency,
capacity building and information exchange in relation
to tax matters.
We remain of the view that the only place where
money-laundering can be controlled effectively is at
the source. While Nauru has done all it can to date to
ensure that its legal and administrative system is
sufficient to prevent such activities, we appear to
remain the subject of adverse criticism from the
Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering
(FATF). Nauru was disappointed not to have graduated
out of the special, non-cooperating countries list. We
will, nonetheless, continue to work on satisfying the
key players in FATF on this issue.
Two most pressing issues facing my Government
in a “post-phosphate” future are energy and the supply
of fresh water, as both have direct impacts on the
standard of living of the community. Nauru is
dependent on the import of fossil fuel for its entire
energy requirement, including for the desalination of
seawater to complement catchments of rainwater.
Before I conclude, Mr. President, I wish to
reiterate Nauru's support for the reform of the United
Nations Security Council, and to support calls for this
issue to continue to receive top priority. In terms of the
United Nations itself, the ongoing administrative and
budgetary reforms by the Secretary-General are
welcome, but much more certainly needs to be done.
24

Nauru is disappointed to see that contributions to
the Global Health Fund are only trickling in, contrary
to our enthusiastic undertaking at the Special Session
last year. Consequently HIV/AIDS, malaria and
tuberculosis continue unabated in their destruction of
communities and continue to rob the manpower of
affected nations. Nauru pledged to contribute $1 per
head of its population to the Fund, and I am pleased to
announce that this pledge has been honoured. I again
call on all Member States, rich and poor, to contribute.
Finally, Mr. President, in the past two years the
Millennium Summit and the Monterrey and
Johannesburg Summits have illustrated the United
Nations' increasing role as a forum for building
consensus. Indeed, the last twelve months have been
trying times in our efforts to build consensus on
development and to maintain international peace and
security. The challenge facing us in this area is not so
much one of building consensus, because we all know
what needs to be done, but rather one of
implementation. Achieving our lofty goals requires
action and cooperation at all levels, from local to
global. Mr. President, we look to you for leadership in
this decisive period and offer our steadfast support.
Finally, 11 September 2001 seems to be a way of
life for some people. It is now etched into history and
what a pity. The perpetrators cannot be proud of what
happened, and we should not allow them or encourage
them to proceed on their merry way. We must pursue
the alternatives we have, as they can be a great legacy
for our children. We the small nations have faith in the
United Nations. We the small nations have hope in the
United Nations. Let us embrace love in its entirety, for
love is a beautiful way of living. Thank you. God bless
the United Nations.















"
1086,57,2002,MHL,"﻿I bring to the
Assembly warm greetings from President Kessai H.
Note.
On behalf of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands, I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan
on his election to this high office. Let me also take this
opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for the hard
work that he and the Secretariat have undertaken in
preparation for this General Assembly.
I am also very pleased to extend a warm welcome
and congratulations from the Marshall Islands to the
people of Switzerland and of East Timor, as the newest
Members of the United Nations.
It is unfortunate that this, the fifty-seventh
session of the General Assembly, is meeting in the
shadow of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks that
shocked our host country — and the world — on 11
September 2001. Modern terrorism is an issue of
concern for all peoples, regardless of nationality or
religion. It is an issue that no nation can afford to
ignore.
While sharing in the feelings of terror, horror and
sorrow caused by the terrorist attacks in the United
States, the people of the Marshall Islands are hopeful
that the Member States of the United Nations will
continue to join together in working towards global
peace and security. I urge this body, which collectively
represents the moral force of all Member States, to do
everything in its power to eliminate the threat of
terrorism.
I am pleased to announce that the Marshall
Islands has recently completed a process of national
priority-setting and of assessing Government policy.
We have thoroughly reviewed the state of our nation
through the holding of a National Economic and Social
Summit, whose findings have formed the basis for our
long-term sustainable development plan, entitled
“Republic of the Marshall Islands Vision 2018”.
This process of review was guided by
consultations with all stakeholders and all sectors of
our society. Extensive discussions and interviews were
carried out in order to ensure that all members of the
Marshall Islands community would have the
opportunity to contribute to our vision for the future.
The Marshall Islands Government has determined
that all development policies and objectives will be
guided by the vision generated by the Summit, and we
are now in the process of implementing the core ideals
of this blueprint for sustainable development.
In developing our national vision, the Marshall
Islands Government has also responded to the
international agenda as set by the United Nations. We
have ensured that our policies will reflect the all-
important priorities of good governance, respect for
fundamental human rights, protection of the
environment, and conservation of natural resources. We
have also taken account of social development
objectives and of the need to invest in the areas of
health and education. We are confident that, by linking
our national priorities to the international agenda, the
correct policy decisions will be made.
During the 1990s the Marshall Islands went
through a period of structural adjustment and reform at
the demand of the international donor community. We
have faithfully carried out these costly and socially
disruptive reforms, in the hope that some form of
reward would be forthcoming. We now have in place a
forward-looking and pragmatic set of policies, and we
are eager to translate them into action for the
betterment of the lives of our people. Yet there are few
who are willing to assist us in achieving this goal.
I therefore stand here, at the fifty-seventh session
of the General Assembly, to advocate for a new
international paradigm: one that recognizes both the
unique challenges facing small island developing
States such as the Marshall Islands, as well as the
unique resources and gifts that such nations possess —
resources that can benefit the whole of the international
community only through substantive and sustained
partnerships.
It is time to reconceptualize the relationship that
exists between more established and less-established
nations, from one of donors and recipients to one of
mutual beneficiaries and collaborators. Only in this
way will it be possible fully to realize the promise of
true international cooperation and development.
The Marshall Islands has so much in the way of
native intellectual, environmental and cultural
resources to share with the international community.
We look forward to creating new forms of partnership
with entities around the world — partnerships that will
redound to the benefit of the global community and of
all its residents.
30

The partnerships that are most meaningful to us
are ones of a practical nature. Our communities, and
those of many other nations like the Marshall Islands,
are seeking partnerships of action that offer pragmatic
and practical solutions that are coordinated and
targeted for maximum effect.
The Marshall Islands shares challenges that are
uniquely peculiar to many small island States: a
precariously fragile environment that is highly
sensitive to the threat posed by global warming; a
narrow economic base that imposes constraints on the
potential for progressive and sustainable development;
and an institutional milieu that is slowly developing the
capability of harnessing the benefits of science and
technology.
In relation to our international partners, the
Marshall Islands is particularly concerned about the
following issues. First of all, we are concerned about
the environment. The Marshall Islands Government
recognizes the need for a coordinated and
comprehensive approach in seeking appropriate
solutions to the challenges posed by environmental
degradation and pollution.
We commend the Barbados Programme of
Action, which, in conjunction with the outcome forged
at the Johannesburg Earth Summit, will provide a
guiding framework for sustainable development for
small island States, such as the Marshall Islands. The
wide divergence of views expressed in Johannesburg
posed many challenges, but also produced rich insights
into areas where our common strengths lie, and into
how these might best be utilized.
Further, it is vital that the international
community recognize the great challenge to life and
culture that is posed by global climate change. This
threat to life and culture is felt most acutely by nations
such as the Marshall Islands — nations that face the
very real threat of complete obliteration if our oceans
rise by even marginal levels.
On behalf of the Marshall Islands, I commend
those States that share our concerns and have signed
and ratified the Kyoto Protocol. May I also urge the
remaining non-signatory States to consider the vital
importance and urgency of this issue. If the
international community does not act now, the future
will see the disappearance of many small island
nations, which in turn will have immeasurable
economic, environmental and immigration
consequences for the entire global community.
Secondly, an issue that is particularly relevant to
the Marshall Islands is that of nuclear cleanup and non-
proliferation. The Marshall Islands seeks partnerships
with members of the international community that will
help raise to new levels the dialogue about nuclear
weapons and their testing.
The people of the Marshall Islands have suffered
greatly at the hands of a world that is continually
preparing for war. We are restrained by the persisting
legacy of toxic nuclear waste, which poses challenges
far beyond our financial and scientific capability to
solve. Our food chain continues to be affected, and our
development is thwarted by our inability to use
damaged lands.
I am pleased to state that the United States
Congress is currently reviewing our situation, and we
are hopeful that the outcome will contribute towards
amelioration of this problem. Nevertheless, we believe
that our hard-learned lessons can help to inform and
instruct the international community in future debates
about the use and testing of nuclear weapons.
And thirdly, another issue that is particularly
pertinent for our people is that of oceans and fisheries.
As a nation whose entire livelihood depends on the
resources of the sea, the Marshall Islands Government
pledges its unwavering support for the Law of the Sea
management regime. In particular, we emphasize the
importance of Article 63 (1) of the Convention, which
speaks of the need for States to agree on measures
necessary to coordinate and ensure the conservation
and development of shared stocks.
The Marshall Islands is also pursuing the
establishment of national fisheries industries that will
gradually enable the replacement of foreign fishing
fleets; the delineation of our own exclusive economic
zone; and the establishment of international guidelines
to protect our oceans for generations of future
fishermen and the people who count on the work they
do for survival.
I have mentioned only a few of the priorities that
my delegation will be seeking to raise at the
appropriate moment in the upcoming committee
debates and in our interactions with United Nations
agencies and our development partners. There are, of
course, many other issues of concern to both the
31

Marshall Islands and the international community as a
whole — issues with which all of us will wrestle in the
coming years.
Among the most important challenges faced by
this body is the continued exclusion of the Republic of
China on Taiwan from the United Nations. The
Marshall Islands Government reiterates its concern that
the exclusion of a nation of peaceful and law-abiding
citizens is not consistent with the inclusive ideal of the
United Nations. I therefore urge each and every one of
you, all of us, to overcome our biases and to allow the
admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the
United Nations.
Another important challenge faced by this body is
the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The Marshall
Islands considers that urgent diplomatic action is
required in order to work towards a peaceful solution
to this threat to international peace and security.
The Marshall Islands wishes to emphasize its
support for the expansion of the United Nations
Security Council. We believe that there should be an
increase in the number of both permanent and non-
permanent members of the Council and that such
expansion should include members from both
developed and developing countries. This would
significantly broaden the representation base of the
Council and thus reinforce its ongoing validity.
May I take this opportunity to congratulate the
international community on its support for the newly-
established International Criminal Court. The Marshall
Islands is hopeful and confident that the Court will
prove to be a powerful mechanism in the
administration of justice at the international level. We
are, however, currently considering the making of a
bilateral agreement under Article 98 of the Rome
Statute and will determine this issue after a careful
assessment of the implications of such an agreement.
Finally, I wish to reaffirm the strong commitment
in fellowship and solidarity of the Marshall Islands
with all the Member States of this body.
Long live the United Nations. God bless the
United Nations.









"
1100,57,2002,PLW,"﻿At the outset, I wish to
congratulate Mr. Kavan on his successful election to
the leadership post of this Assembly and to offer my
country's welcome to East Timor and Switzerland
following their recent admission into our family of
nations.
We gather here slightly more than one year after
the appalling, unconscionable events of 11 September
2001. The world is still striving to come to grips with
the full implications of the inhumane savagery of the
attacks here in New York and in Alexandria, Virginia.
Given the great number of areas in which the various
Members of this Organization have differing and often
competing interests, we can all derive hope and pride
from the fact that the solidarity so evident in the
General Assembly last year is still largely intact today.
Governments around the world continue to cooperate
in efforts to identify, locate and shut down terrorist
organizations and those who would give comfort and
aid to such organizations.
Palau, in spite of the inherent limitations imposed
by its size, remoteness, capacity constraints and
economic vulnerability, has fully committed itself to
working with the community of nations to defeat
terrorists and their sympathizers. We have aggressively
pursued revisions in our laws which make it easier to
gather information on suspicious persons and activities,
to share information with other jurisdictions, to block
suspect financial transactions, to establish domestic
criminal penalties for transnational crimes, to
specifically recognize acts of terror as crimes under our
domestic legal system, and to streamline our
procedures for asset seizure and extradition in order to
better cooperate with our comrades in this war on
terrorism.
However, the limitations to which I have referred
are hampering our efforts to fully implement these
2

laws. No matter how much we may wish to support the
global war on terrorism, Palau, like many other
developing nations, will not be able to participate
meaningfully in this vital campaign without the
assistance of the developed nations. Therefore, to those
leading the combat against terrorism, Palau says:
“Please, give us the tools we need to make a substantial
contribution to this fight and render practical support
for your efforts.”
While the great majority of nations remain united
in their desire to see terrorism defeated — and that is a
cause for hope — there are also grounds for concern.
Some nations appear to be wavering in their resolve to
take concrete actions to prevent terrorist attacks, while
some others seem not to fully appreciate the new
dynamic of the post-11 September world. Those who
supported or condone the events of 11 September take
heart when they hear members of this body speak of
waiting for a consensus before acting to remove
credible threats to national and international stability.
Terrorists and their sympathizers are likewise
comforted when they hear leaders continue to talk in
the old language of how to react to terrorism, rather
than speak of how to prevent and pre-empt the next
attack. Nothing pleases the forces of global terror more
than hearing members of the world coalition against
terrorism speak of measured and agreed-upon
responses to the next atrocity.
The bottom line is this: The potential for
catastrophic harm is so great that we cannot wait for
the next attack. In this regard, Palau fully supports the
United States in its resolve to pre-empt further attacks
and loss of life. The very laudable ideal of multilateral,
consensus-driven action is good, but it cannot justify
and will not excuse the loss of human lives and the
degradation of human life that will result from giving
those who rely on or sponsor terror the opportunity to
strike first, either directly or by proxy. Palau therefore
calls upon the Members of the United Nations once
again to come together in their commitment to forestall
future tragedies.
As noted earlier, we can derive some satisfaction
from the fact that the goodwill and unity of purpose
that prevailed immediately after last year's subhuman
attacks in large part continue to exist. However, Palau
also notes that the recent World Summit on Sustainable
Development revealed a dismal lack of commitment to
addressing the development needs of the great majority
of nations. The failure of key nations to recommit to
the goals of the Rio Earth Summit is equally
disappointing. Taken together, those developments
demonstrate that such goodwill and solidarity
apparently are confined to matters that most concern
the developed world.
The lack of progress on sustainable development
also strongly suggests that the developed world still
sees developing nations such as Palau as mere token
members of the international community, rather than as
viable partners. The current view the developed nations
seem to have of the developing world is unacceptable
and can lead only to greater unrest and instability in the
future.
It is time for the unity of purpose that
characterizes the global war on terror to be brought to
bear in an equally global campaign for sustainable
development. It is time to take affirmative action to
counteract the effects of globalization and correct the
technological imbalances that are widening the gap
between developed and developing nations. It is time to
take concrete action to give developing nations the
tools they need to manage and speed up their own
development in ways that will lead to the replacement
of dependence on foreign aid with dependence on
domestic industry. It is time to implement measures to
end the marginalization of developing countries in the
new global economy. In that regard, Palau welcomes
and applauds the Koizumi Initiative as one of the sadly
few positive outcomes of the World Summit on
Sustainable Development and calls upon all developed
members of the United Nations to develop similar
initiatives.
The position of certain members of this body on
fundamental environmental issues also suggests that
global solidarity is limited to areas that concern the
major Powers of the developed world. United Nations
Members that have enjoyed and continue to enjoy the
highest standard of living have done so and continue to
do so at the expense of the environmental integrity of
our planet. Those major emitters are threatening the
lives of small island States such as Palau, placing their
mere comfort above our very existence. At the same
time, they seek our support for their goals and
initiatives. That, too, is unacceptable.
Fortunately, most of the developed world,
including the governments of the major industrialized
economies of Japan and the European Union, has
recognized its responsibility and has endorsed the only
3

viable response to the existing and worsening adverse
impact of climate change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the
no-regrets philosophy it embodies. It is time for those
developed nations which have shirked their
responsibilities and shunned the Kyoto Protocol to end
their callous disregard for the fate of those nations
most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate
change, to admit that the Kyoto Protocol remains the
only meaningful first step towards comprehensively
addressing climate change and to join the great body of
nations that have pledged to work together through the
Kyoto Protocol and beyond to combat the effects of
climate change.
It is time to take the lessons we have learned from
the war on terror, lessons regarding the fundamental
importance of working together to respond to a
common threat, lessons regarding the very real
interdependence of all nations and lessons regarding
the need for, and ability of, nations to balance genuine
global concerns against perceived self-interests and
apply them to the threats posed by climate change and
sea-level rise.
Throughout my remarks today, I have emphasized
Palau's strong support — in some cases, demands —
for global action to address the major threats to
stability and progress in this new global order. That is
because it has become apparent, as never before, that
the widest possible participation in responding to those
threats must be encouraged, if real and lasting solutions
are to be found.
In light of that fact, Palau must once again note
the folly of excluding any potential partner from the
efforts of the United Nations to meet the challenges we
now face and to prepare against the challenges to
come. Such exclusion is particularly short-sighted in
efforts of the international community that go beyond
politics and address fundamental human concerns, such
as health and education. For that reason, Palau must
again call upon the members of the United Nations to
welcome the Republic of China — Taiwan — into this
Organization. At the very least, the membership at this
body should endorse the participation of the Republic
of China, Taiwan, in the World Health Organization,
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the United Nations Development
Programme and similar bodies dedicated to improving
the human condition. Mere politics should not be
allowed to compromise or prevent the development of
a truly global effort to alleviate human suffering and
better mankind.
In the area of health, I have appeared before this
body in the past, where I discussed the ill effects of
tobacco use and our responsibility to protect our youth
from the threat of tobacco addiction. I appear before
the Assembly today to ask again for its complete
support for the Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control, in order to combat tobacco-related illnesses
and complications.
Throughout these remarks, I have also repeatedly
returned to the idea of security. That is primarily
because we feel less secure in the aftermath of the
monstrous attacks of 11 September 2001. The very idea
of security has taken on new meaning. Our collective
understanding of the kind of cooperation and
integration that is necessary to provide effective
security has changed radically. Yet, one of the foremost
bodies for dealing with security, the Security Council,
has remained unchanged. That can hardly be right. In
this new environment, it is time to re-examine the
composition and powers of the Security Council, to
consider how it may be made both more accessible and
more accountable and to find ways to increase its
ability to respond in a prompt, flexible and effective
manner to the threats to peace that are sure to arise in
the future.
In closing, let me again confirm Palau's
dedication to, and determination to take part in, the
global efforts to meet the challenges facing us all.
Palau will continue to do all it can to support universal
responses to threats to peace and stability, especially
mid- and long-term threats, such as climate change and
sea-level rise and the widening gaps between
developed and developing nations. On behalf of the
people and Government of the Republic of Palau, I call
upon all Members of this great Organization to do
likewise.






"
1143,57,2002,AUS,"﻿Let me begin by
congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President
of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I
am also pleased to welcome Switzerland as a new
Member of the United Nations.


Let me acknowledge also two other significant
developments: the establishment of the African Union,
and the creation of the New Partnership for Africa's
Development. Both raise real hope for a new era of
political stability and economic growth for Africa.
We meet at this General Assembly in the shadow
of the terrorist attacks on this great city one year ago.
Those chilling events were an attack on the values of
the great civilizations represented here today, values
that are central to the United Nations Charter and this
Organization.
We can take some comfort in knowing that the
international community has responded, deliberately
and resolutely, to international terrorism. The coalition
in the war against terrorism  led by the United States
and joined by others, including Australia  has
accomplished a great deal. The Al Qaeda network in
Afghanistan has been disabled. The Taliban regime has
been defeated. Now the world is a safer and more
humane place.
But terrorism cannot be stamped out by military
effort alone. Together we must choke off support 
financial and otherwise  for terrorism. We must stop
the patrons and bankrollers of the trade in terror, and
together face this insidious threat. The decisive
response of the United Nations after 11 September,
embodied in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),
created a framework for Member States to join forces
in suppressing, prosecuting and punishing terrorist acts
and terrorist financing.
All Member States must implement the
commitments made in resolution 1373 (2001).
Australia has strengthened its counter-terrorism
legislative and law enforcement framework. We are
party to 10 of the 12 anti-terrorism instruments and
will ratify another later this month. Australia is also
assisting other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to
implement their obligations.
We face another grave threat to international
peace and security, one that tests the very authority of
the United Nations. For over a decade, Iraq has flouted
legally binding obligations to disclose and eradicate its
programmes for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has
defied United Nations resolutions, United Nations
inspections and United Nations sanctions, and it has
ignored some 23 of the 27 United Nations obligations
imposed on it under 16 Security Council resolutions.
The Secretary-General has been patient, flexible and
assiduous in his efforts to get Iraq to comply with
Council resolutions. But Iraq has refused to work with
the United Nations in efforts to dismantle its
programmes for weapons of mass destruction.
Until this occurs, Iraq is a grave threat to its
neighbours and to the world. Iraq's well documented
aggression towards its neighbours and its past use of
chemical weapons underline the potency of the threat it
poses. Grave concerns remain about Iraq's present
capabilities.
Up until 1998 United Nations weapons inspectors
did much good work in finding and destroying Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction program. But the work of
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
was never finished, because in 1998 the inspectors
were effectively thrown out of Iraq. Four years later,
there is little doubt that Iraq has been working hard to
rebuild its chemical and biological weapons
programmes. Moreover, serious questions also remain
about Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.
This state of affairs cannot be left unresolved.
Iraq must give immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to inspectors to all areas, facilities,
equipment, records and Iraqi officials. In short, Iraq
must fulfil the requirements of all relevant Security
Council resolutions. If Iraq has nothing to hide, then it
has nothing to fear. Indeed, by meeting these demands,
Iraq and its people have everything to gain.
Let us also be very clear: Iraq's flagrant and
persistent defiance is a direct challenge to the United
Nations, to the authority of the Security Council, to
international law, and to the will of the international
community.
We cannot stand by and allow ourselves to be
ignored. Nor must protracted negotiations be allowed
to weaken and eventually paralyse efforts to allay fears
about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. We all must
demonstrate a clear, collective determination to uphold
the authority of the Security Council, and to ensure that
its resolutions on Iraq are implemented in full.
Otherwise, if Iraq's pursuit of these abhorrent weapons
is allowed to continue, we may shortly be asking
ourselves why we failed to act.
The terrorist threat has given new urgency to our
disarmament and non-proliferation goals, and puts
demands on us for a renewed effort to stop the spread
of weapons of mass destruction  both to non-state
25

and state actors. We have to be alive to the willingness
of terrorist groups to develop and use chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons.
Australia, for its part, intends to pursue practical
and effective measures through international non-
proliferation treaty regimes and export-control
arrangements. These regimes and arrangements have
delivered tangible security benefits, and should be
supported strongly.
We also need to deal with other transnational
challenges: not just terrorism but other transnational
crimes, including the smuggling of arms, drugs and
people.
Transnational crimes threaten all countries. They
require us to cooperate further in law enforcement,
intelligence and financial controls  much like the war
on terrorism.
People-smuggling and trafficking, in particular,
are a truly transnational problem. This lucrative
criminal enterprise undermines the international
refugee protection system, and legal migration
programs, that have enabled millions to build new and
prosperous lives in countries like Australia. Combating
people-smuggling and trafficking in persons is
particularly important to Australia and to the Asia-
Pacific region. This year, Australia co-hosted a
regional ministerial conference with Indonesia.
Ministers from thirty-eight countries committed
themselves to stopping the people who deal cold-
heartedly in human cargo. We agreed that, in the first
instance, people-smuggling must be legislated against
as a serious crime. There is much more we need to do,
and Australia welcomes international discussion and
action on the issue, including within the United
Nations system itself.
Australia welcomes the addition of the
International Criminal Court to the international legal
framework. It is an example of positive international
cooperation which will complement the efforts of
States to end impunity for the worst violations of
international humanitarian law.
United Nations work in East Timor is another
outstanding example of how the organization can, and
does, make a difference  in this case in response to a
humanitarian crisis. In May we celebrated East Timor's
independence. We are now about to welcome East
Timor as a new member of the United Nations. That we
have arrived at this point owes much to the resolve and
courage of the East Timorese. It owes much also to the
United Nations and United Nations authorized missions
that brought stability and order and renewed hope for
the future.
I congratulate the Secretary-General and the
Security Council for providing the United Nations
Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) with the
necessary support, not just for peacekeeping and
policing, but also for developing stable governance in
East Timor. Sustained United Nations and international
support will be critical in East Timor's formative years.
Australia is determined to provide such support. I
would like to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello's
efforts in East Timor, and to congratulate him warmly
on his appointment as United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights.
HIV/AIDS is a global issue that tears at the fabric
of our society, and threatens the economic development
of entire continents. The United Nations General
Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June last
year brought home to Member States their
responsibilities to marshal national and regional
responses to HIV/AIDS. Australia hosted a regional
ministerial meeting in Melbourne in October 2001.
Ministers agreed on the need to develop strategies to
fight HIV/AIDS, and on the need to share lessons and
cooperate in priority areas. We helped establish the
Asia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS and
Development to engender greater cooperation in the
region, and we applaud the appointment of a United
Nations regional envoy for HIV/AIDS.
The United Nations has a heavy agenda. But it
cannot  and should not  try to do everything. To
make a difference it must be selective and focused,
matching its activities to its capabilities and to the
priorities that we, the Member States, set for it. The
Millennium Declaration gave us clear, agreed
priorities. And the Monterrey Financing for
Development Conference and the Johannesburg
Summit on Sustainable Development have built on
these, giving us a framework to shape and direct our
work. We also need to revitalize and reform the way in
which the key organs of the Organization  the
General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,
the Security Council  function. The Security
Council, in particular, should be reformed, including by
expanding its membership.
26

We also need to think again about the relationship
between these organs and the Secretariat: time is not a
free good, nor are meeting services, nor are the
Secretary-General's reports, and nor is the capacity or
will of Member States to provide resources without
limits. We need to look at how we can more effectively
use existing Unite Nations mechanisms  particularly
the General Assembly and the United Nations
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)  as bodies
of review. And we are especially concerned that major
United Nations conferences have become so large and
unwieldy that their fundamental purposes have been
obscured.
Australia strongly supports the process of reform
proposed by the Secretary-General for his second term.
This provides a unique opportunity to address these
questions and to `re-tool' the Organization so as to
build on its strengths. As Member States, we are the
United Nations. The Organization is there to serve our
collective interests.
In order to address new threats and challenges,
the United Nations must be focused and responsive,
and its key organs must function efficiently and
effectively. We must continue to work together to
enable it to meet our expectations. I am confident
that  together  we can achieve success.







"
1224,57,2002,VUT,"﻿In addressing this
honourable Assembly, I first wish to convey the
greetings of the people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Our
future will be determined by the nations represented
here today.
I also take this opportunity to congratulate you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-
seventh session of the General Assembly. You have
assumed the presidency during a turbulent period in
international relations, and my delegation pledges its
full support and cooperation to you, as you guide this
noble Organization through this difficult time. I also
take this opportunity to acknowledge with deep
gratitude the contributions of your predecessor, who so
competently steered the work of the fifty-sixth session
of the General Assembly to its conclusion.
I acknowledge with much gratitude and
admiration the outstanding leadership and diplomatic
skills of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His
outstanding wisdom has made it possible for the United
Nations to maintain its credibility and relevance not
only in maintaining international peace throughout the
world, but also in ensuring that this Organization
continues to address the development challenges
confronting the world, including Vanuatu.
I am pleased to welcome the Swiss Confederation
as a Member of the United Nations. I am looking
forward to the imminent admission of the Democratic
Republic of Timor-Leste, a nation where Vanuatu was
honoured to have participated in the United Nations-
administered peacekeeping process.
The deeply disturbing events of 11 September
will remain etched in our memories for a long time. On
behalf of the Government and people of Vanuatu,
I have the solemn duty of conveying to the
Government and people of the United States of
America, including the families of the innocent victims
of 11 September 2001, our sincere condolences for the
many innocent lives lost on that fatal day of the most
inhuman act of modern history. The barbaric and
cowardly acts of 11 September have shaken the
foundations and principles on which this Organization
is built. They have ushered in a new period of global
uncertainty.
Terrorism has become the scourge of our time.
This complex phenomenon has scarred our planet. As
responsible members of the international community,
we must work closely together in order to eradicate it.
However, any action of reprisal or punitive measures
must receive universal support through established
multilateral and international structures, beginning
with the United Nations, the most universally
2

represented organization. It is very dangerous to take
any action outside such mechanisms. We request that
all actions undertaken must, above all, serve the
purpose of guaranteeing justice, peace and security in
the future world.
In particular, we call upon the initiators of a
military action against Iraq to show great wisdom and
responsibility to ensure that their decisions do not
create a new world order of insecurity, hatred and
conflict, defined by cultural, ethnic and religious
divisions. All actions taken must be consistent with the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter
and established international law.
Although the fight against terrorism has taken
centre stage, it must not lead us to forget or to neglect
development issues and security concerns inherent to
the developing world, in particular, to the small island
States. Some resources will inevitably be reallocated to
the growing problem of security, but it must not
overshadow the development agenda of the developing
world. It is in that context that my delegation wishes to
associate itself with the statements made by other
Pacific island countries in endorsing the Pacific Islands
Forum declarations that have been distributed as a
United Nations document.
The recent World Summit on Sustainable
Development held in South Africa unambiguously
reminded us that much remains to be done in
addressing the challenges inherent to the world's many
developing economies. The environment and the
negative impact of climate change are of extreme
concern, and we urge those countries that have not yet
done so to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as
possible. The ratifications of Japan, the European
Union, China and Russia have been most welcome.
The aggressive policies of developed countries
continue to marginalize many of the world's very small
developing economies, such as that of Vanuatu.
Binding commitments to international declarations and
legislation are the cornerstone of a peaceful and just
world in which justice prevails above all. There must
be equitable partnerships and cooperation so that we
can all contribute our support and confidence.
While small nations, such as Vanuatu, are being
forced to comply with conditions imposed by
developed countries, some of those same nations
decide at the same time to impose policies that
encroach upon national and regional positions.
Vanuatu is firmly opposed to the proliferation of
nuclear weapons in all their forms. In that context, my
Government once more unreservedly condemns the
ongoing transfer of radioactive materials in the Pacific
Ocean. The flagrant disregard for national and regional
opposition is a clear demonstration of the policies of
the powerful. That negligence is shameful in the light
of the many ideals and principles espoused by this
Organization and its various entities. Given the recent
adoption of the Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy
at the Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in the Republic of
the Fiji Islands, I strongly call on the shipping States to
respect the efforts of the Pacific Island countries to
safeguard their principal resource: the sea.
The conditions imposed by the powerful with
respect to the initiatives of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are
another clear demonstration of the game of the
powerful, in which we see the big nations manipulating
the world order to their own advantage. Those
abominable policies affect the very boundaries of
national sovereignty for the benefit of the developed
countries. We must put an end to all this hypocrisy, if
we, the small nations, are to be treated fairly and as
equal partners in the international community.
Vanuatu opposes discriminatory policies and
legislation which expose our vulnerability to a very
volatile global environment. Some of our national
efforts to stimulate economic growth are being stifled
by the enormous pressure exerted by the club of the
rich, which does everything to ensure that their
position prevails. Where does that leave us? I must
stress this because Vanuatu has done its best to comply
with the OECD initiatives, including through
legislation to prevent money-laundering and to ensure
transparency in financial transactions. Yet, that rich and
influential organization continues to put forward
further demands. We are ready to negotiate within a
time-frame that must first suit our economic and
political requirements. But the OECD must, in turn, be
ready and able to provide immediate relief and
solutions. Any decision by the OECD to blacklist
countries such as Vanuatu is premature and
unwarranted. It would serve the interests of the OECD
alone. Vanuatu is confronted with a dilemma because
the countries that introduced the tax-haven policy
during the colonial period continue to place
unreasonable demands on our already weak economy.
3

On that note, I must also mention the complicated
and extreme difficulties that my country is facing as it
struggles through its reform process. Given the
established millennium priorities, there is still an acute
shortage of financial assistance necessary to effectively
implement national development priorities. We have
become accustomed to receiving plenty of foreign
advice that is, unfortunately, not backed up by real
financial support. That has placed an extreme burden
on the already scarce resources available in the
country. I believe that it is important that our
development partners try to better understand the
particularities and unique characteristics of not only
Vanuatu but also other small and fragile economies of
the Pacific islands.
The existing ban on exports of kava to Europe
and the United States is another indication of the unfair
and discriminatory policies practised by the powerful
nations. We expect that other countries will, in turn,
join the ban. However, there is no scientific evidence to
justify those trade sanctions, which have impacted
negatively on the economy of Vanuatu. We therefore
seek the support and understanding of the international
community in order to allow time for the adequate
scientific research to be carried out before such trade
restrictions are imposed. Kava products exported to
Europe and other destinations are mixed with non-kava
products. For the moment, it is completely unfair and
discriminatory to impose such a ban.
My Government fully supports the efforts to
reform the United Nations system in order to create a
stronger and more efficient organization. On this issue,
my delegation endorses the position of other
delegations on the need to restructure the membership
of the Security Council so that it may better reflect the
geographical representation and the under-represented
groups of Member States without affecting the
Council's authority.
The question of Taiwan must also be adequately
addressed here. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted by
the General Assembly in 1971, resolved the legal and
political representation of the People's Republic of
China as a Member of the United Nations. Therefore,
any attempt by Taiwan to gain admission to the United
Nations or to any of its affiliated organs or special
agencies will not be supported by my Government. The
United Nations must ensure that it does not become
involved in the conflict between China and Taiwan,
which is a matter totally within China's purview.
I should also like to take this opportunity to
mention the problem of West Papua. At the Millennium
Summit, the then-Prime Minister of Vanuatu touched
on the important matter of the principle of self-
determination for the people of West Papua. The
question of West Papua has always occupied a special
place on Vanuatu's foreign policy agenda. The Charter
of the United Nations espouses the principles that
continue to guide the Organization's efforts with regard
to self-determination. We are completely convinced
that, if the United Nations is to be consistent in its
decisions to promote recognition and respect of the
fundamental right to self-determination, the question of
West Papua must be placed on the agenda of the
Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the
Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of
Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The
closed-door policy with regard to the pleas of West
Papuans continues to undermine the credibility of the
United Nations in terms of its ability to address an
essential matter. I think it is in the best interests of the
international community that the question of West
Papua be revisited. We also request that a commission
of inquiry be deployed to verify information on
atrocities alleged to have been committed in West
Papua.
In conclusion, we must continue to support the
pivotal role of the United Nations in efforts to create a
just and equitable world. We must stem the growing
gap between the developed and developing worlds in
order to guarantee economic and social prosperity for
all — a critical prerequisite to guaranteeing political
stability, peace and security throughout the world. The
effective implementation of the United Nations agenda
for development, in particular the Millennium
Declaration and the Monterrey and Johannesburg
Declarations, will advance that process. A more
favourable international environment will assist the
developmental priorities of developing countries and
will address the great economic imbalances prevailing
today. True goodwill, respect, tolerance and equality
will be necessary if we are to move forward. The role
of the United Nations will be crucial in that process,
but only if support is forthcoming from its Members.






"
1246,30,1975,NZL," I am glad indeed to have this early opportunity to congratulate Mr. Thorn on behalf of New Zealand on his election as President. New Zealand's relationship with Western Europe is of great importance historically and because of our close trade links, which we intend to preserve. We have been involved in negotiations with the European Economic Community which are basic to the well-being of our people. For the spirit of friendly understanding in which these negotiations have been conducted, New Zealand owes a great deal to him personally. We are confident that the same competence and understanding will distinguish Mr. Thorn's present term of high office. He can be assured of our fullest co-operation in his difficult task.
216.	This thirtieth year of the existence of the United Nations has been a year of unprecedented economic and social activity. It has been a year when more than half of the world's population, that half which consists of women, has been reasserting its unanswerable claim to equal status and opportunity with men. For far too long women have been forced to carry an undue burden of the world's poverty and prejudice. And for them, quite rightly, words are no longer enough.
217.	It has been a year also in which the poorer developing nations have been pursuing with great
vigor their unanswerable claims to fairer terms of trade to enable them to earn a better life for their own people. And for them, quite rightly also, words are no longer enough.
218.	The shocks and economic pains of the last two years have shown as never before the urgent necessity for practical steps to achieve change, Nations which for long have called for a new economic order are now at last being joined by others which are realizing that change is in their interests also. The growing interdependence of all nations is more apparent. We welcomed the general political commitment to change firmly and unanimously adopted at the seventh special session. We welcomed the new spirit of conciliation and compromise. Even more, we welcomed the obvious strong determination to go beyond words and votes and get down to practical action. The effectiveness of the United Nations will be judged not by its words, votes or hopes, but by its practical achievements in helping to bring about a better life. The record of words and resolutions of 30 years of United Nations existence would fill many warehouses; but the practical achievements can be quickly listed. So we must achieve a better balance, a balance that would provide new life to the United Nations and justifiable new hope to the peoples of the world,
219.	The next steps are crucial. We now have a map showing the possible roads to the objective of a new world economic order. But the new rules of the road must be worked out and agreed upon to ensure that fast travelers do not monopolize the highways. Those who started late and those who wish to travel more slowly must have their fair share of the road also. They must be given the right of way at times so that they, too, can reach the destination that they desire for themselves. Difficult economic and political decisions will have to be made by developing and developed countries alike. It will take a new political will assisted by popular backing for the measures that are necessary in the wider interest. A task as far-reaching as this will never be easy; it never has been, nor will it ever be so. But, at least, we are committed to try.
220.	Last year, on behalf of my Government, I stressed the folly of squandering vast resources on the armaments race, which is now estimated to cost $300,000 million a year over $75 for every man, woman and child living on this earth. This is a frightening thought, when we know that over 1,000 million people have less than $200 a year to live on. It is an appalling waste of resources considering the desperate need to use all the skill and capital investment available for developing new sources of energy to help provide the increasing supply of food that is urgently needed to prevent much of the world's population growing, up with stunted bodies and minds.
221.	The ever-growing trade in arms is another intensely disturbing development. Arms must not be treated as a normal means of earning money for the export trade. Those nations which contribute to the $20,000 million total of the world's arms trade surely bear a heavy responsibility to review their arms sales policies. This needs to be done on a joint basis for at present we find countries sheltering behind the sad argument that if they do not supply arms some competitor will.
222.	My country views with special concern the constant growth of nuclear weaponry, with all its unthinkable consequences. And now as never before we require urgent agreement on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, a treaty that will put an end for all time to the further development and testing of new and even more terrible methods of mass destruction. But, beyond that, we need measures that will actually stop and reverse the build-up of nuclear weapons.
223.	The New Zealand Government acknowledges with satisfaction the decision taken by the French Government a year ago to end its Program of testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, of which due note was taken by the International Court of Justice in its decision last year. We, the Government of New Zealand, acknowledge with satisfaction the decision of the French Government at that time. At the same time, let it be clear that New Zealand regrets that all nuclear-weapon States continue to test nuclear weapons, whether in the atmosphere or underground.
224.	We regret that a number of States with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons have not yet signed the non-proliferation Treaty. We regret the unwillingness of some countries to agree to international control and supervision of peaceful nuclear explosions.
225.	We believe we must have a comprehensive test- ban treaty. We believe that all countries must ratify and carry out the non-proliferation Treaty. Each day that passes when those steps are not achieved, more and more people view the continued piling up of nuclear arms with fear and horror. But if those steps were taken, it would help create the confidence on which greater measures of disarmament would be built.
226.	As long as there is no comprehensive test-ban agreement, as long as there is no visible sign of progress towards such an agreement, it is natural that groups of like-minded neighboring States should try to reduce the legitimate anxieties of their peoples. New Zealand is attempting to do this by approaching the problem of nuclear disarmament on a partial and regional basis.
227.	A remarkable feature of the disarmament debate at the twenty-ninth session was the upsurge of interest in nuclear-free zones. At the Review Conference to the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons held at Geneva last May the value of this approach was fully recognized in the Conference's Final Declaration [A IC. 111068, annex /}. The Secretary-General, in an important passage in the introduction to his report this year, emphasized that nuclear-weapon free zones provide the best and easiest means by which those States which neither possess nor want to possess these weapons can, by their own initiative, interest and effort, ensure the total absence of nuclear weapons from their territories and enhance their mutual security [Aj 10001 lAikl.I, sect. VIII].
228.	As the Secretary-General pointed out, the Latin American countries have already made substantial progress towards this objective in a large and populated part of the globe [ibid.]. For some years my Government has believed that the independent and self-governing nations of the South Pacific might emulate the example of their Latin American neighbors in an adjoining area. Although the South Pacific contains a vast expanse of ocean, it also comprises many islands and the inhabitants of these islands are deeply concerned about the nuclear threat. Last July, the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free zone was discussed further at the South Pacific Forum by the Heads of Government of Australia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Tonga, Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea, whose independence and forthcoming membership in this Organization we greatly welcome. These nine South Pacific countries agreed unanimously that the concept of a nuclear- free zone in the South Pacific should be studied further and that, as a first step, the General Assembly should be asked to endorse the concept of such a zone. Accordingly, two members of the Forum which are also Members of the United Nations, Fiji and New Zealand, have proposed for this session an item on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Pacific [item 120], We appreciate that it is a complex question, and we are, of course, anxious to consult all countries which might be affected by the proposal. This process of consultation has already begun.
229.	We hope that Members will recognize this proposal as a positive response to a widespread desire to extend the application of the nuclear-weapon-free zone concept, and we ask you to accept this action as contribution to nuclear disarmament and the strengthening of peace. It is on that basis that I ask with confidence for the support of all Members of this Organization .
230.	The house of peace will be constructed from many building blocks. The great Powers have offered us no final blueprint. Sometimes we have no choice but to start building, setting some blocks in place without knowing precisely what the final structure will look like. But we do believe that all who can must start building those blocks now, in the knowledge that they will ultimately be used to build the house of peace that we all seek. My Government, for its part, will support any constructive proposal which offers the prospect of early progress towards disarmament.
231.	My Government regrets that the question of the admission of new Members to the United Nations has again become a matter of controversy. The early history of this matter was an unhappy one: for many years, well qualified applicants were denied admission through the use or, rather, the abuse of the veto power. Eventually, a large number of longstanding applicants were admitted together, in what was described at the time as a 'package deal'. What was done then strained the provisions of the Charter, but my country actively worked for a positive result, believing that it was intolerable to exclude qualified applicants indefinitely and that exceptional measures were required to solve the problem.
232.	After the log-jam was broken in 1955, applications, for the most part, were dealt with promptly and on their individual merits; a large number of new Members were admitted without difficulty. The divided States Germany, Korea and Viet Nam  were the main exceptions, and they were recognized as a special problem. Then, just two years ago, the two Germanys were admitted simultaneously. We hoped that this welcome development would be followed by agreed solutions in respect of Korea and, following a peace settlement, in respect of Viet Nam. Unhappily, this has not proved possible. On the contrary, a situation has arisen which seems likely to provoke more controversy and bitterness and which could delay for a long time the admission of several countries which should be Members.
233.	I wish therefore to describe my Government's general attitude towards the question of membership in the present situation. We believe that applications should be dealt with in accordance with the principle of universality. It is true that the present membership provisions of the Charter do not reflect that principle as clearly as we believe they should. In our view, membership in the United Nations is primarily a duty. Membership imposes important obligations, and no sovereign, independent State should be prevented from assuming them.
234.	That is not the only consideration. Membership also exposes countries to the cross-currents of international opinion; it can help to reconcile different views, or at least moderate them; and the benefits of all this can not be lightly disregarded.
235.	My Government therefore favors the admission of North Viet Nam, South Viet Nam, North Korea and South Korea, even though reunification may remain the ultimate objective or even a priority objective in those countries. We recognize that North Korea is not at present pressing its application, which it first submitted some 25 years ago. But that is not a valid reason, we believe, for not admitting South Korea. There has been criticism of one of the permanent members of the Security Council for linking the application of South Korea with those of North and South Viet Nam. But if that approach is to be deprecated, then equally so is the attitude of those who insist that an application from South Korea can be considered only in conjunction with an application from North Korea in other words, that both States must apply together. If linking is wrong in the one case, it is equally wrong in the other. My Government regrets that the Security Council did not approve the applications of North and South Viet Nam. We hope it will reconsider their applications and consider that of South Korea as well at an early date.
236.	My Government believes that in order to bring about universality the Charter provisions concerning admission should be simplified. In our view, the unanimity rule should not be applicable to membership applications in the Security Council and should be replaced by a suitable qualified majority. The criteria for admission should be the generally accepted criteria of independent statehood.
237.	There is a further consequence of our philosophy of universality, and this concerns Members which do not live up to their Charter obligations. In my country's view, the philosophy of universality is opposed to the tendency which has recently become evident to invoke the expulsion provision in Article 6 of the Charter. We regard expulsion as a last resort, and one of doubtful practical value. It would be a substantial improvement if provision could be made for a variety of sanctions against a Member which persistently violated the Charter, including suspension from the exercise of some or all of the rights and privileges of 
membership. The Member wh.ch is subjected to these measures should not, however, be relieved of the obligations of membership. In our view, that is a serious drawback to the present expulsion provision.
238.	New Zealand is a firm supporter of the process of decolonization and of the principles of racial equality enshrined in the Charter. During the past year we have followed the developments in southern Atrica with close concern. My Prime Minister welcomed the opportunity to discuss the situation in southern Africa with the Heads of Government of the African countries which are members of the Commonwealth when the Commonwealth Heads of Government met in Kingston in May. New Zealand fully subscribed to the views expressed by Commonwealth Prime Ministers, including those relating to sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia and on the question of aid to the many indigenous peoples of southern Africa.
239.	In southern Africa there has been since last year's session of the Assembly encouraging progress in some areas, but disquieting developments in other areas, and in still other areas a disheartening lack of forward movement.
240.	Following the admission to the United Nations a year ago of the first Portuguese colony to be liberated, Guinea-Bissau, three more newly independent African States which were formerly under Portuguese rule have now taken their place among us. I take this opportunity to say a special word of welcome to the representatives of those countries. My country is conscious of the special problems which these new Governments face after a long period of struggle for their freedom and independence.
241.	The decolonization of Portugal's African colonies has brought about a fundamental shift in the balance of forces in southern Africa. With this change has come new hope for a solution of the problems of southern Rhodesia and Namibia. In Southern Rhodesia the goal of independence on the basis of majority rule has at times during the year seemed closer. It remains the earnest hope of my Government that this goal will be achieved quickly and peacefully. We trust that the Smith regime will take full advantage of what may well be the last opportunity to achieve a negotiated settlement. As the Commonwealth Heads of Government pointed out at Kingston, if peaceful avenues are blocked by the Smith regime, a stepping-up of armed struggle seems inevitable.
242.	Towards the end of 1974 the Prime Minister of South Africa asked that his Government be given six months to demonstrate its determination to make progress on the issues which caused the Assembly to reject the credentials of the South African delegation at the twenty-ninth session. Those six months have elapsed, and the United Nations is entitled to ask what progress has in fact been made. On the positive side, let us acknowledge that the South African Government played a constructive role in bringing Mr. Smith to the conference table with the leaders of the liberation movements in Southern Rhodesia. On the negative side, I think we must acknowledge that there has been little indication of any intention on the part of the South African Government to abandon its intolerable policy of apartheid. For the non-white majority of its people, South Africa continues to be a police State in which racial discrimination is not simply a matter of ignorance and prejudice but a fundamental doctrine embedded in the basic political and legal system.
243.	South Africa's position in regard to Namibia is equally indefensible. South Africa has no legal claim to the Territory. The situation is a simple one, where the people of Namibia as a whole should be given the opportunity to exercise the right of self-determination as soon as possible under United Nations supervision. In the absence of a change of heart on these issues, South Africa cannot expect to resume its rightful place in the international community.
244.	Since east and south-east Asia is an area of prime concern to New Zealand, I cannot conclude without commenting briefly on some of the important events that have taken place in this region during the past year.
245.	In Indo-China the prolonged military struggle is over. Political power there is in new hands, and whatever views we may hold about this we must all be grateful that the conflict has ended. There are lessons to be learned from the Indo-China experience if we, the international community, are prepared to heed them. It is not recrimination which is called for now, but a spirit of reconciliation and a readiness to help with the task of reconstruction. Some of the international agencies have already been engaged in this task, and their support has been invaluable. My Government is playing its part. We are willing, if so requested, to help with development Programs here as elsewhere without considerations of ideology.
246.	Elsewhere in South-East Asia the changes may not have been as dramatic as they have been in IndoChina. But developments are under way which promise to be just as significant for the region's future. We have been heartened above all by the growth of a genuine regional spirit. This is best seen in the progress of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The five members of the Association have displayed a sense of cohesion and common purpose in seeking new solutions to old problems. New Zealand has been pleased to offer support, in practical ways, for their collective efforts. We look forward to the day when with them, and with the countries of Indo-China we will work together as a partnership in a wider scheme of regional co-operation, for this is the way ahead.
247.	My Government finds the trends in Asia encouraging. The situation in Korea, however, remains a source of serious concern. The continuing tension there, to which accusation and counter-accusation, threat and counter-threat, contribute, is a relic of another era.
248.	The Korean question has been on the Assembly's agenda for a quarter century. Korea may seem remote to some countries and the history of events there may be growing dim. But in considering this item it would be folly to forget that the interests of many Powers are involved. It has been the scene of a terrible war. With irresponsible handling it could be the scene of another. The supreme interest of the United Nations is peace. It is our duty to make decisions that contribute to peace and reconciliation rather than to insecurity and continued bitterness. It is my Government's earnest hope that this year a solution will be found that is acceptable to all parties and particularly, of course, to the two Korean States. If such a solution requires that the United Nations Command be dissolved, then we have a responsibility to ensure that adequate arrangements remain to safeguard peace and the well-being of the Korean people.
249.	In conclusion, the general debate with which we open each session of the General Assembly gives each Member small or large, poor or rich an equal opportunity to speak out honestly and frankly on matters it regards of vital concern. Indeed, it is more than an opportunity; it is a right and a responsibility. Each Member equally has a responsibility to help solve the problems facing the United Nations, and to contribute a share of the needed resources in proportion to its means. New Zealand has spoken out on the issues of most concern to us. I renew our pledge to play our part in finding fair and constructive solutions.


"
1312,30,1975,AUS,"Mr. President, may I first express to you most hearty congratulations from my Government and from myself on your election to the presidency of the thirtieth regular session of the General Assembly. I am sure that your own experience and personal distinction as Prime Minister of Luxembourg and the wisdom and the diplomatic skills for which your country has long been famous will stand you in good stead as you preside over the meetings of this session.
2.	And this session is a historic one. We are commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations. This is a time for some satisfaction and much reflection. Our Organization, whose Charter was written in the final months of the greatest conflict the world has ever suffered, has grown and developed through 30 difficult years, which have subjected it to great strain. But we, the Members of the Organization, must pause to reflect how far we have succeeded in our efforts to implement the purposes and the principles of the Charter. We must reaffirm the principles and ideals, and recapture the enthusiasm, which animated those who drafted the Charter in 1945.
3.	The Charter has stood the test of time very well. We have all yet to make full use of the Organization to achieve the primary purpose declared in Article 1, to achieve international co-operation in solving economic and social problems. But the seventh special session made an excellent new start, and was a most important step towards resolving the major questions it faced. There was constructive debate and effective negotiation, with an evident desire for improvement in international economic relations. Its resolution [3362 (S-VIl)] was adopted unanimously, and the further negotiation on its detailed provisions is already beginning.
4.	On this occasion, so soon after the special session, I wish only to re-emphasize that in the course of these further negotiations Australia will examine on their merits all proposals deriving from the resolution, for we support the thrust and objectives of the resolution and the achievement of a new international economic order.
5.	The success of the special session in the face of the complexity of the interests at stake, some of them involving competition for limited resources, is renewed and timely proof of the high value of the United Nations. We must treat this invaluable asset with care.
6.	Our Charter opens with the expression of the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. This was a passionate conviction which bound together the delegations at San Francisco. Today it is vital that all of us gathered here and the Governments that we represent should be equally determined to prevent developments which could lead to war. The past 30 years have not been scarred by a catastrophe of the scale of the two world wars, but they have been marked and marred by many smaller conflicts. The United Nations has helped to control and resolve some of these conflicts, but dangers to peace still abound.
7.	From the early days delegations have been agreed that to implement the Charter properly requires a great international effort to achieve disarmament, or at least the controlled reduction of armaments. Year after year in this Assembly, and in various bodies established by it, we have debated, argued, contended and endeavored to reach agreement on disarmament. All too often the thing most lacking was the sense of mutual trust and confidence without which no agreement for the reduction of arms can succeed.
8.	The question of the reduction and control of nuclear armament is complex. But the essential nature of the problem and the essential responsibilities of Governments to solve it are clear. Here I wish to concentrate on some crucial aspects of nuclear disarmament.
9.	The sense of urgency which was evident in the debates which led to the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] of 1968 must be maintained. At that time there was widespread recognition of the dangers of the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the five Powers which already possessed them, and the increase in the nuclear weaponry of those Powers. We must continue to guard against any erosion of the non-proliferation Treaty and strengthen the will to make it work.
A/PV.2357
10.	The Final Declaration of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [AIC.III068, annex I] points the way ahead. All nations represented here, 
whatever their attitudes to the Treaty itself, should appreciate the value of this Declaration for our future deliberations.
11.	For many nations nuclear energy is an essential factor in their future economic development, but due attention must be given to the horrifying consequences of any diversion of fissionable materials to weapons manufacture. The growth of the civil nuclear industry throughout the world must be accompanied by internationally accepted safeguards to protect the security of all States.
12.	An important step was taken in August last year when major suppliers agreed on additional safeguards to be applied to exports of certain nuclear materials and equipment. At the Review Conference there were encouraging indications that suppliers agreed on the need for further energetic action in this field. But the pace and scope of follow-up action has not so far been encouraging. Time is not on our side in this vital matter. The need for more power, the development of technology and the activities of commercial interests will not wait for Governments to act. Governments must keep ahead of them in the working out of safeguards.
13.	We must also give the most careful attention to the problems presented by the conduct of nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes. Austral;., would not try to deny to any State any legitimate means which would obviously assist it in its development. But, in the case of nuclear explosions, the very nature of the technology used makes us just as alarmed about the proliferation of such devices as we are about the spread' of nuclear weapons themselves. The technology can be diverted from peaceful to military purposes. The United Nations family has to find a satisfactory solution to this complex and urgent problem. Australia welcomes the establishment of the advisory group, which will hold its first meeting on 29 September under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency to consider this problem. We hope that all participants will approach their very difficult task in a spirit of determination to succeed.
14.	It was obvious at the Review Conference, and in other meetings, that many non-nuclear-weapon States feel that in the implementation of the non- proliferation Treaty the burden is falling too heavily on themselves. In the consensus achieved at the Review Conference there is some hope that this justified concern of the non-nuclear-weapon States is being recognized by the nuclear Powers. We urge the nuclear Powers to make stronger efforts to meet the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon States.
15.	No one should underestimate the difficulties in the way of achieving real agreements in this vital area. We cannot condone the stockpiling of weapons which ultimately are a threat to all mankind. We share the concern of countries which fee! their own security threatened by these weapons. There is no security in increasing the number or power of weapons or the number of States who make and hold them. Both are factors making for insecurity.
16.	As the first step the United Nations should continue to work for the acceptance of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty as the most appropriate means of achieving nuclear arms control.
17.	I turn now to the question of decolonization. Under the Charter, colonial Territories have been a major responsibility of the United Nations, and the task is not yet complete.
18.	It was a matter of pride for Australia that on the day on which this thirtieth session convened, the former Territory of Papua New Guinea became independent. This brought to an end the Trusteeship Agreement concluded in 1946 between the General Assembly and the Government of Australia. Now, as equal, sovereign States, Australia and Papua New Guinea are friendly neighbors, and our relations cover a wide range of mutual interests. Over the years we have known each other we have developed a considerable degree of mutual trust. The Australian Government and the Australian people express to the Government and people of Papua New Guinea their warmest fraternal greetings. We look forward to friendly and neighborly co-operation with Papua New Guinea in many fields, including here in this Assembly.
19.	During the past year we have been happy to see other former dependent Territories achieve independence and apply for membership in this Organization. We welcome the admission of the new States of Cape Verde, Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe. The pace of decolonization in the continent of Africa has increased tremendously, though very difficult problems still remain. Despite the commendable efforts by a number of interested parties, the impasse in Southern Rhodesia continues. But we still hope that there will be early progress towards the convening of a constitutional conference, with the declared objective of a negotiated transition to majority rule. The present situation is unacceptable and dangerous, and the regime in Southern Rhodesia must be made to realize the urgent necessity of negotiations on this basis.
20.	Both through our participation in the work of the United Nations Council for Namibia, and also directly, we have sought to play our part in trying to bring about Namibia's full and complete independence. Regrettably, the recent South African moves in regard to the future of Namibia do not meet the requirements of the United Nations. The Australian Government chose Namibia Day—26 August—to express to the South African Government its strong concern at the inadequacy of that Government's policies and actions. We stressed the urgent need to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations. We said the Organization must be involved in any process of consulting the people of Namibia if it is to have international credibility. We restated our firm position that Namibia should move rapidly towards independence as a united country and that the genuine leaders of the people should be parties to that process. We shall maintain our pressure on South Africa on this matter for as long as may be necessary.
21.	It is now 15 years since the fifteenth session at which the General Assembly adopted two resolutions on decolonization and Non-Self-Governing Territories resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). The former was the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The latter stated the principles which should guide Members in determining whether or not an obligation existed to transmit information under Article 73 e of the Charter. The greatest problems facing this Organization in the colonial field were and still are in the continent of Africa. However, we are glad to see that in recent years the United Nations has been devoting more attention to colonial problems outside Africa and particularly to the problems of small Territories. There still exist a considerable number of small colonies, most of them islands or groups of islands, which face very acute problems and which do not have a great deal in the way of natural resources for their solution* Here there is scope for more effort, more application of what the United Nations has learned over the past 30 years. The objective must be for the peoples of small dependent Territories to achieve not only an end to political dependence but reasonable economic conditions which are essential to the proper enjoyment of political freedom. We must be careful to take full account of the particular circumstances of each Territory and of the wishes of its people. Australia has greatly valued its close association with the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and respects the experience and dedication of its fellow members. Our close cooperation with the Special Committee is reflected in the importance we are attaching to its recommendations on the Territory of the Cocos Islands.
22.	I should like now to state briefly how Australia sees certain major political issues. I start, quite obviously, with the Middle East. The Australian view has long been that the existence of the State of Israel has to be accepted, and Israel has to have assurances of its security. Equally, the concerns of the Arab States for their security and territorial integrity have to be respected. We believe that, in conformity with the principle of self-determination, the Palestinian people has the right to create a State of its own, alongside Israel, if it so wishes. We believe that the legiti-mate rights of the Palestinian people are now widely recognized and accepted as one of the major keys to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East.
23.	Australia welcomes the recent conclusion of a further interim disengagement agreement between Egypt and Israel. We see this as a further step towards peace, which we hope will lead to progress in other areas and to a full, peaceful and just settlement. We commend the continuing contribution made by the United Nations, especially through the Security Council and the peace-keeping forces established in the area.
24.	With regard to Cyprus, we commend and thank the Secretary-General for the dedicated manner in which he has carried out his mission of good offices for the parties concerned in Cyprus. We see the role of the international community as essentially one of encouraging, where possible, the successful conclusion of inter-communal talks, of avoiding any action which would prejudice these talks, and of assisting in the alleviation of the difficulties faced by persons displaced by the violent events of last year. During the present year Australia has continued its efforts to help to ease the plight of displaced persons in Cyprus, and we have maintained our contingent of police with the United Nations force.
25.	The Australian Government welcomed the end of the long conflict in Indo-China, which has caused so much suffering to the people of the countries of this region. Now that the war is over we trust that all South-East Asian countries will work to develop relations based on mutual respect and trust. Only if all the countries in the region, and the great Powers, accept that each State has the right to determine its own future free from outside interference will there be true prospects for peaceful and enduring co-operation and friendship in the area.
26.	It is a matter of regret that the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam are not today seated in this General Assembly and it is our hope that, following our appeal to the Security Council, the situation will soon be changed. This Organization is now close to the achievement of universal membership; the admission of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of South Viet Nam would be two more steps towards that goal.
27.	In June of this year I paid visits to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea. I was greeted warmly in both places. In both parts qjf Korea the people share a past and traditions of great value. But the vast gulf which has grown between them in the past three decades is very real. We wish to see good relations between the two States, but any realistic approach to the future of the whole of Korea has to proceed from the recognition that two separate entities exist, and that each is the lawful Government of that part of Korea in which it exercises effective control.
28.	In our view, the two Governments are equally sovereign, and therefore in determining the future of the peninsula, unified or otherwise, the two Governments should act with full respect for each other's sovereign rights. Peace must be agreed, but it needs to be an enduring peace, recognizing the realities that exist in the peninsula. Peace has been preserved under an armistice agreement for over 22 years. We would welcome any progress which could be made to strengthen the prospects for reduction of tensions and for lasting peace. We would be most concerned if the prospects for progress were set back by the dismantling of machinery which has proven its usefulness, without putting something no less effective in its place.
29.	When I visited Pyongyang and Seoul I made it clear that Australia would support either or both of the Korean Governments if either or both wished to join the United Nations.
30.	Might I turn to the question of the peaceful settlement of disputes. In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization this year, our Secretary-General made some pertinent observations about the evolution of the role of the United Nations in its primary function of maintaining peace and security. It was in similar spirit that at the last session of the General Assembly Australia proposed under agenda item 36 on strengthening the role of the United Nations a re-examination of the possibilities inherent in the Charter for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Our intention was to strengthen the application of the Charter and to bring again to the attention of the Members the variety of flexible procedures available to them in the Organization for the peaceful settlement of disputes, some of which deserve more attention than they have received in recent years. In accordance with the resolution adopted at the last session [3332 (XXIX)], the Assembly will be considering this year a report prepared by the Secretary-General. Australia hopes that this report will stimulate a useful debate from which Members will become more aware of the machinery available to them for the settlement of disputes.
31.	I should mention, too, another initiative which our delegation took at the last session of the General Assembly concerning diplomatic asylum and which was adopted as resolution 3321 (XXIX). A useful debate was held in the Sixth Committee and the debate will be resumed at this present session. It is clear from last year's debate that it will be a slow business to reach agreement on this subject, but the ultimate objective is a very important one, one we are fighting for, and we should like to see all States participating in this work.
32.	I have been pleased to note the remarks that have been directed towards the question of the law of the sea, because this is certainly a vital problem with which this Organization is dealing. The problem of the law of the sea affects not only immense political and strategic issues but also the economic future of all nations, whether coastal or land-locked. The new rules of international law now under discussion embrace not only the essential norms of sovereignty and the traditional freedom of navigation, but also questions of the exploitation of natural resources in an area which covers two thirds of the earth's surface. The new law must make a reality of the concept of the common heritage of mankind.
33.	The third session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, held at Geneva this spring, produced for the first time a single negotiating text, thanks to the initiative of the President of the Conference and the able work of the Chairmen of the three Committees. This text will be supplemented by a negotiating text, submitted by the President, on settlement of disputes. These texts have been studied by the Australian Government and discussion with other Governments has already begun. It is our hope that at the next session, in New York in March 1976, the Conference will agree on a negotiated text which can be accepted by Governments and which can become the convention of Caracas. In any event, we must press the negotiation to the earliest possible successful conclusion. As the Secretary-General reminded us recently, a modern law of the sea for peace and co-operatjon on the sea cannot be achieved by bilateral or regional agreements. A universal convention is essential.
34.	On the question of human rights, this Organization, over the past 30 years, has endeavored to define, to broaden and to express in legally binding instruments the principle of human rights as contained in the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately the United Nations has also had to express deep concern about many violations of human rights. We must press on with this work, however difficult, because the alternative is to fail to honor the principles affirmed in the Charter, by which we are all bound.
35.	The Australian Government attaches great importance to International Women's Year as a symbol of the need for change and improvement and as a great new departure in itself. The scope of activities in International Women's Year is very wide because it aims at the improvement of the status and role of women in the development process and in all aspects of life. At issue are the legitimate needs and demands of half the population of the world. Deep-rooted discriminatory practices and discriminatory social attitudes have placed women in a position of artificial inferiority. Women everywhere in the world must achieve freedom and equality.
36.	I could sum up all the points I have tried to make very simply. The Charter has shown that with all its imperfections it is basically a sound instrument which provides the statements of principle and the institutional framework which al! countries need if we are to live in peace and mutual respect. But the task of applying principles of the Charter and living up to them requires great and continuous effort. Unless that effort is made, this Organization cannot succeed, and a light will go out of the world. It is the firm conviction of my Government that this Organization must succeed and to that end we reaffirm the pledge which we made in San Francisco in 1945. We must not fail the peoples whom we represent and in whose name our Charter was written.
"
1409,51,1996,VUT,"﻿First of all, Sir, I offer you my delegation’s
heartiest congratulations on the occasion of your election to
the presidency of the fifty-first session of the General
Assembly. Your rich experience in bilateral and multilateral
diplomacy is, for my delegation, a guarantee for the success
of our work. My country, the Republic of Vanuatu, and
yours, Malaysia, enjoy friendly and cooperative relations.
I also wish to express my country’s thanks to your
predecessor, Mr. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, for the
commitment, competence and skill with which he guided
our work at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly.
I wish to express my country’s appreciation to the
Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for the
remarkable work that he has consistently done since the
very beginning of his term of office in the service of our
Organization. I reaffirm here my Government’s support for
the principle by which, according to tradition, Africa has a
right to a second mandate.
My Government has made its modest contribution to
disarmament and arms-control measures. This modest
contribution has been made in the areas of conventional
weapons and weapons of mass destruction alike. With
regard to conventional weapons, on 10 July 1996 the
Republic of Vanuatu provided the Secretary-General,
through the Centre for Disarmament Affairs, with
information on imports, exports and the re-exportation of
weapons covered by the Register of Conventional Arms
established by the Secretary-General under General
Assembly resolution 46/36 L of 9 December 1991. The
information I have mentioned is contained in the report of
the Secretary-General in document A/51/300 of 20 August
1996.
I wish to reaffirm the position of the Government of
the Republic of Vanuatu on the complete elimination of
anti-personnel landmines. Indeed, at the fiftieth session of
the General Assembly, the Republic of Vanuatu voted in
favour of resolution 50/70 O entitled “Moratorium on the
export of anti-personnel landmines”. As we all know, the
majority of the victims of anti-personnel landmines are
women and children.
In the area of weapons of mass destruction, my
Government has made its modest contribution through
measures at both the regional and international levels. Let
us take a look first at the regional level.
The Republic of Vanuatu acceded last year to the
Treaty of Rarotonga establishing the South Pacific
Nuclear Free Zone. I take this opportunity, on behalf of


the people and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu,
to congratulate the United States of America, the French
Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, which signed the Treaty last year. My
Government welcomed the ratification last September by
the French Republic of the Protocols to the Rarotonga
Treaty and pays tribute to its initiative of sending an expert
team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
to conduct a radiological study at the sites of French
nuclear tests in French Polynesia.
In the area of global nuclear disarmament, on 24
September 1996 I signed, on behalf of my Government, the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted by the
General Assembly on 10 September 1996. Moreover, my
country acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, opened for signature in Moscow, London
and Washington on 1 July 1968, and supports the indefinite
extension of that Treaty.
The Republic of Vanuatu, like other Members of our
Organization, took note of the Advisory Opinion rendered
last summer by the International Court of Justice, the legal
organ of the United Nations, on the legality of the threat or
use of nuclear weapons. This Advisory Opinion is an
additional commitment in favour of nuclear disarmament.
The major objective of measures taken and to be taken by
the Republic of Vanuatu in the coming years is to
demonstrate our commitment to the complete and general
disarmament of our entire planet.
I would like to express my Government’s views on
some regional conflicts, namely, those in the former
Yugoslavia in Central Europe, in the Great Lakes region in
the heart of the African continent, and in the Middle East.
Regarding the situation in the former Yugoslavia in Central
Europe, my Government welcomes the elections held on 14
September as an important step forward for the future of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the Great Lakes region of
Africa, my Government supports the efforts of our
Organization, in close cooperation with the Organization of
African Unity, to avert a widespread war in that region.
Finally, with respect to the situation in the Middle East, my
Government congratulates the Palestinian and Israeli
delegations on having decided last Sunday, 6 October 1996,
to resume discussions that should lead to a lasting peace in
that region.
In the area of international law, the United Nations,
through the International Law Commission, must continue
to play a major role in the codification of international law.
In this respect, the Republic of Vanuatu joins with other
Members of the United Nations in calling for the
convening of an international conference of
plenipotentiaries entrusted with considering the draft
statute of an international court prepared by the
International Law Commission and with concluding a
convention establishing an international criminal court.
In the area of human rights, in September 1995 the
National Parliament of the Republic of Vanuatu adopted
a law on the office of mediators. The mediator began his
work in late 1995. I take this opportunity to thank the
Government of Papua New Guinea, in the context of
cooperation between members of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group, for its valuable technical assistance in
helping my Government to implement fully and with
relative celerity the provisions of the aforementioned law.
Above and beyond the role of mediator, there is,
obviously, the fundamental law — the Constitution of the
Republic of Vanuatu — which guarantees the
fundamental rights and individual freedoms of all of its
citizens.
I wish to recall the statement made here by the
Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu at last year’s
commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption
of the Charter of the United Nations, in which he
reaffirmed the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu’s
support for the reform and rational management of the
United Nations system. I also take this opportunity to
express my Government’s opinion that the scale of
assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of our
Organization must faithfully reflect the capacity to pay of
the Member States of our Organization.
In the area of development, my Government will
participate in the special session of the General Assembly
next year devoted to the assessment of Agenda 21 and
hopes, with other delegations that have expressed this idea
here, that new commitments will be undertaken towards
the environment. In this respect, the Environment Unit of
Vanuatu’s national bureau of the environment, created in
1986 under the auspices of the Ministry of Natural
Resources, will work in close collaboration with the
environmental programme of the Oceanian region in
preparing the Pacific region’s contribution to the work of
the special session of the General Assembly.
Last year, through a decision of the Ministry of
Home Affairs and Decentralization to apply the law on
decentralization within the Republic of Vanuatu, my
Government reduced the number of provinces from 11
to 6. The purpose of this reduction was, first, to allow the
2


major islands to help the smaller ones; secondly, to allocate
financial and human resources to all of the provinces; and,
finally, to demonstrate the will of my Government to
decentralize administrative and public functions for the
benefit of provinces. In other words, it encourages
communities and individuals to participate in the economic
and social development of the Republic. In this regard, I
take this opportunity to thank the United Nations
Development Programme in its capacity as a multilateral
partner in the regional efforts of all Oceanian States and,
more particularly, for its valuable assistance to the
Government of the Republic of Vanuatu in drafting its book
on sustainable human development in Vanuatu. My
Government presented this book to the press on
23 September.
In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm here the faith of the
Republic of Vanuatu in the United Nations.











"
1417,51,1996,PLW,"﻿It is my distinct honour to
address the United Nations during this historic session,
which I am confident will be remembered for all time for
its adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty.
20


The Republic of Palau applauds and thanks those
countries that will be signatories to the Treaty, for we
believe that it does much to advance our goal of ridding the
planet of nuclear weapons. The Treaty, by banning further
testing, will help prevent the development of more
dangerous nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the Treaty will
help prevent other nations from obtaining existing nuclear
weapons. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty thus
clearly helps to make the world a safer place for us and for
all of our children.
The Republic of Palau’s commitment against the
creation and proliferation of nuclear weapons is long-lasting
and resolute. When the people of Palau adopted our
Constitution in 1978, we became the first country in the
world to become a constitutionally mandated nuclear-free
country. Indeed, protecting our citizens from these horrific
weapons of destruction is at the very heart and soul of our
Constitution.
While not every country will sign the Treaty, the fact
that the world’s five recognized nuclear Powers — the
United States, China, France, Russia and the United
Kingdom — have agreed to abide by the terms of the
Treaty and that the overwhelming majority of other nations,
including the Republic of Palau, have also agreed to abide
by its terms gives the citizens of my country and of every
other nation on Earth the hope that one day we will be free
from these catastrophic weapons of destruction and of the
threat they pose to each of us and to our global
environment.
Accordingly, I would like to thank all of those who
helped bring the citizens of the world this Treaty, including
the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test
Ban, Ambassador Ramaker of the Netherlands, and
especially our close neighbour and great friend, the
Government of Australia, which took the lead at the United
Nations in making this Treaty a reality.
Another of my nation’s primary concerns is the issue
of how to protect the environment while providing
sustainable economic development. This is a central issue
for small island nations in particular and for other
developing countries around the world. The Republic of
Palau is therefore very pleased by the recognition and
affirmation that human beings are at the centre of
sustainable development and that they have the right to a
healthy, productive and meaningful life in harmony with
nature.
However, to make sure that this affirmation becomes
a reality, action must be taken at all levels of government,
in particular at the international level. To help every
nation achieve this goal, developing countries, including
small island nations, must be provided the necessary
resources to enable them to implement the decisions and
recommendations of the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development, the Global Conference on
the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States and other significant international conferences.
The Republic of Palau, a small island nation in the
Pacific, cherishes its recognition as an independent
country and greatly values its membership in the United
Nations, which allows our voice to be heard on global
issues such as the importance of freeing the world of
nuclear weapons and protecting our global environment.
We believe that perhaps the most critically important role
of the United Nations is to provide a forum for nations
large and small to discuss, debate and reach agreement on
how best to serve economic, social, cultural and other
humanitarian problems. Consequently, we believe that
those countries which have made demonstrated efforts to
advance regional and global peace, security and prosperity
by establishing partnerships with other countries to further
these causes have much to offer the United Nations as a
whole and to its constituent Members individually.
In his inaugural speech to his country, United States
President Bill Clinton pointed out that it is very likely
that every problem we face has already been solved
somewhere in the world. The challenge for us all is to
communicate with each other so that we can discover
those solutions. The United Nations clearly provides the
forum for such dialogue and discovery to take place. The
Republic of Palau believes that a greater number of
voices invited to participate in these discussions can only
lead to better solutions to the myriad global problems we
all face.
The overwhelming support given to the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty aptly
demonstrates that, through many people working together,
the cacophony of historically divergent voices can be
harmonized for the benefit of all the peoples of all the
nations on Earth.











"
1471,51,1996,AUS,"﻿I should like to extend
warm congratulations to Mr. Razali on his election as
President of the General Assembly. As a close neighbour
of Malaysia, Australia will confidently rely on his
experience and sound judgement as he presides over this
important session of the Assembly.
I feel greatly honoured to be leading for the first
time the Australian delegation to a session of the General
Assembly.
A year ago, when the Assembly adopted the
Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary
of the United Nations, it made an important promise: to
give to the twenty-first century a United Nations that
would serve effectively the peoples in whose name it was
established. We must keep that promise, but to do so we
8


will need a clear view of contemporary circumstances and
of those which we can see unfolding into the twenty-first
century.
The landscape that was revealed at the end of the cold
war, just a little over five years ago, has many new
features, some of which are still not clear. What is clear,
however, is that we face new challenges and that we have
new opportunities that few of us would have imagined five
years ago.
The most compelling of these opportunities is to take
future steps in nuclear-arms control and disarmament. The
possibility of taking such steps is surely a principal
outcome of the end of the cold war. This was firmly
underlined last Tuesday when, in a single day, 67 countries
signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. That
number, only a week later, is now nearly 100. But beyond
this achievement lies another major opportunity, which is
to turn our national and international attention to enhancing
human security in all its aspects.
Our dynamic times have presented us with new
problems. Such problems include the major non-military
threats to security: the clandestine arms trade, the narcotics
trade, HIV/AIDS, the need to stabilize the rate of growth of
the world’s population and major threats to the
environment.
The elemental characteristics of such non-military
threats to security are that they cannot be defeated by
weapons. They cross state boundaries and they can affect
whole populations. These characteristics lead to one central
conclusion, that is, action on these problems must be the
subject of international cooperation.
Multilateral cooperation can, does and must take many
forms. But the role of the United Nations is unique because
of its universality and because of the rules we find in the
Charter of the United Nations.
It is for these reasons — the nature of the
opportunities we have before us, the problems we face and
the unique role and capability of the United Nations — that
we must keep last year’s promise of a United Nations fit
for the challenges of the twenty-first century.
Australia’s particular commitment to the United
Nations is founded on the belief, articulated as far back as
the 1950s by the then Foreign Minister, Richard Casey, that
the United Nations represents the practical effort of the
Governments and peoples of the world to attain the high
goals to which they are pledged through the United
Nations Charter: international peace and security and the
economic and social advancement of all peoples.
Australia has contributed readily to achieving those
goals. Whether by paying its financial contributions in full
and on time, by providing personnel to peacekeeping
operations or through its contributions to development
programmes, Australia has been determined to see the
United Nations succeed. I commit Australia today to
continuing such involvement in the work of the United
Nations.
At present, a window of opportunity in arms control
and disarmament is open to us. If we do not take it soon,
it will close. Large and sophisticated nuclear and
conventional arsenals continue to exist. In a number of
regions, suspicions remain close to the surface. The risks
of the spread of weapons of mass destruction have, in
certain respects, increased.
In Australia’s view, two tasks are fundamental: first,
building and strengthening international institutions and
instruments; and secondly, developing new thinking in
arms control and disarmament so as to push the
international agenda forward in constructive and realistic
ways.
To achieve progress with institutions and
instruments, Members of the United Nations need to work
together on at least six priorities. These priorities for
international cooperation are to make the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its enhanced
review process operate more effectively; to strengthen the
International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; to
achieve an early start for the Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons; to reach early
agreement on effective verification machinery for the
Biological Weapons Convention; to pursue the goal of a
global ban on anti-personnel landmines in conjunction
with a global approach to the problem of demining; and
to achieve a ban on the production of fissile materials for
nuclear weapons.
As we pursue these priorities in the multilateral
system, we should keep firmly in mind that progress in
regional security, particularly in regions of weapons-
proliferation concern, will make a crucial contribution.
The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is of
course the immediate priority. Its adoption by the General
Assembly and its opening for signature on 24 September
9


were major milestones for the international community. The
Treaty is a product of our times. It flows from a long and
commonly held global concern. Its death was something the
international community simply could not allow.
Australia was therefore prepared to take the lead in
bringing the Treaty to the General Assembly. The
overwhelming support for the resolution demonstrated the
strength of international feeling against nuclear testing. This
Treaty was wanted and needed, but it has also helped
change the international climate. We can now reasonably
hope and expect that nuclear testing will not be part of the
future to be faced by succeeding generations. In a world
with a mixed history on controlling the development and
spread of destructive weaponry, that is something of which
we can all be proud.
The Treaty must become universal. We urge all those
countries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the
Treaty as soon as possible so that it can be fully
implemented as quickly as possible. There is no merit in
the argument that says that, because there is more to be
done in nuclear-arms control and disarmament, we should
in some way scorn or reject a Treaty that bans all nuclear
explosions forever. This ban has intrinsic value. We must
now keep up the positive momentum generated by the
adoption of the Treaty.
This brings me to the second task: developing new
ideas. Because building institutions and strengthening
international instruments will not be enough, the
international community must also develop imaginative new
ways of guiding the world into the next century.
The Australian Government established the Canberra
Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons to
address the questions of whether a nuclear-weapon-free
world is feasible and, if so, the measures which could be
taken to attain that objective. I am delighted to confirm that
the Commission has more than met Australia’s
expectations. Its report will make a major contribution to
international thinking and discussion on nuclear
disarmament. The Australian Government will take it
forward by circulating it today in this Hall, will present it
to the Secretary-General tomorrow and introduce it to the
Conference on Disarmament in January.
The Canberra Commission report recommends a
political commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to the
elimination of nuclear weapons. That is the first and central
requirement. The report then sets out six immediate steps:
taking nuclear forces off alert; removal of warheads from
delivery vehicles; ending the deployment of non-strategic
nuclear weapons; ending nuclear testing; initiating
negotiations further to reduce United States and Russian
nuclear arsenals; and an agreement among the nuclear-
weapon States on reciprocal no-first-use undertakings and
of a non-use undertaking by them in relation to the
non-nuclear-weapon States.
The Commission also recommends three reinforcing
steps: action to prevent further horizontal proliferation;
developing verification arrangements for a nuclear-
weapon-free world; and the cessation of the production of
fissile material for nuclear-explosive purposes. The
Commission placed particular emphasis on the importance
of effective verification in the achievement and
maintenance of a nuclear-weapons-free world.
Having at last, after 33 years, met the challenge of
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the
international community must now push on with further
practical and realistic measures on nuclear-arms control
and disarmament.
As already indicated, one such measure is the
negotiation of a convention under which it would be
agreed that there will be no further manufacturing of
weapons-grade fissile material. This convention should be
sought now.
Any discussion of arms control and disarmament in
today’s world that failed to address the question of
landmines would be sadly incomplete. These hideous and
diabolically inexpensive weapons must be banned.
Australia will support efforts that will be made at this
session of the Assembly to take the next step towards the
negotiation of an international convention to that effect.
But in the meantime, there are in excess of 100
million of these maiming weapons distributed in the soil
of too many countries. Demining must proceed at a far
faster rate than has been the case in the past. There have
been technological barriers to increasing that rate and
Australia has therefore proposed that a technology
working group be established among interested and
capable countries with the purpose of designing the
equipment required for demining on a far larger and
quicker scale.
If there is any doubt about the need for this action,
I would place on record here that, if the current rate of
demining in Cambodia were to be maintained, that
country, which has struggled so hard to repair itself,
10


would not be free of these mines for a further 130 years.
This must be unacceptable to all. That is why the
Australian Government recently committed $12 million to
practical demining initiatives in the war-ravaged fields
within our own region.
Security Council reform is another vitally important
item on the peace-and-security agenda. The three key issues
to be tackled are expansion, transparency and the
effectiveness of sanctions regimes.
There is now a general acceptance that the Security
Council must be expanded and modernized if it is to
manage international peace and security more effectively.
Although Australia wants to avoid making the Council too
unwieldy, there can be little doubt that its membership
needs to reflect better current geopolitical and economic
circumstances. Expanding the membership is an important
element in achieving this and Australia believes that an
expansion up to a total Council membership of 25 States
would be reasonable.
This brings me to the more contentious point of
permanent as against non-permanent membership. Australia
has made clear that it supports the claims of Japan and
Germany to permanent membership. This is the very least
the United Nations can do to acknowledge their major-
Power status and the financial contribution they are making
to the Organization.
Australia also advocates permanent seats on the
Council for underrepresented regions. As to how that is to
be achieved, we remain flexible. Whether those seats are
filled by a single member or rotate among leading Member
States agreed on by regional groupings needs to be
discussed further, primarily by those regions concerned. We
also see scope for an increase in the number of
non-permanent members of the Council, again in the
interests of ensuring greater balance in representation.
I turn now to the need for greater transparency in
Security Council processes. Consultative mechanisms have
improved in recent times, notably between the Secretariat
and troop-contributing countries, but more needs to be
done. Australia is committed to trying to improve the way
in which the Security Council interacts with non-members
so that the Council’s activities become more responsive to
the United Nations as a whole.
More needs to be done, too, to build the Council’s
relationship with regional organizations. Good progress has
been recorded to date, but United Nations and regional
organizations should meet regularly in order to develop
further the appropriate division of responsibilities.
The Council also has an important role to play in
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and enhancing the effectiveness of the
non-proliferation regime.
Australia wants to see improvements in the
effectiveness of United Nations sanctions because we
recognize that the Security Council’s use of collective
sanctions continues to be an important and, at times,
contentious enforcement measure. The effectiveness of
sanctions regimes could be improved in three ways:
clearer drafting of Security Council resolutions; providing
specific objectives and realistic time-frames; and through
relevant sanctions committees providing clear
interpretative guidance on implementation. These are
changes that are essential for the Security Council’s
dynamism. We need to press ahead with them to ensure
that the Council reflects modern-day circumstances and
realities.
Our contemporary circumstances have opened up
new needs and prospects for peacekeeping and preventive
diplomacy. Initial post-cold-war hopes about the
capabilities of the Security Council have been tempered.
It has become clear that many conflicts are intractable.
Experience has taught us that it is difficult to reach
agreement on suitable approaches and to find enough
resources, particularly in the area of peacekeeping.
The Security Council must be realistic in the
implementation of its Charter responsibilities. It must
resist pressure to embark on missions before it has
completed adequate preparations, developed a focused
sense of the mission’s goals and agreed on a clearly
articulated mandate.
At this very moment, the United Nations is
confronted with major challenges in such diverse
situations as those in Cyprus, Burundi and Liberia.
Australia has been contributing personnel to the United
Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, for example, for
over 20 years and has been saddened by the recent
incidents of violence there. The time has come to resolve
that situation, which requires the assistance of all parties.
One very important area of reform for United
Nations peacekeeping is to establish an enhanced rapid-
reaction capability. There have been many proposals on
this issue, but the Australian Government believes that the
11


Canadian study, Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability for
the United Nations, contains some commendable
recommendations, including the development of a
deployable, operational-level headquarters to strengthen
planning for operations.
Australia welcomes recent moves by the Department
of Peacekeeping Operations to begin implementing
measures aimed at improving United Nations rapid-reaction
capability, but in taking these measures forward, the United
Nations should consult adequately with all Member States.
Australia is also keen to see the United Nations
develop the preventive-diplomacy agenda and it welcomes
the greater resources the Secretariat now devotes to such
activity. The Security Council, the General Assembly and
the good offices of the Secretary-General, as well as
regional arrangements and agencies, have important roles to
play in preventive diplomacy. Australia supports greater use
of Chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific settlement of
disputes. Article 33 is particularly important. The Security
Council can use it to undertake a leadership role by calling
on disputing parties to seek a solution using negotiation,
mediation and other peaceful means.
As I indicated at the beginning of this statement, one
of the chief results of the end of the cold war must surely
be an increase in our ability to turn away from military
concerns and to give a greater degree of attention to threats
to the security of individuals, as distinct from those threats
to the security of States that have dominated our thinking
in the past, important and basic though they have been and
remain.
In today’s world and in the world we see unfolding
into the twenty-first century, the security of far too many
people is threatened in ways no less immediate than the
threat of the gun. I have in mind narcotics, HIV/AIDS and
major threats to the environment. These threats cannot be
dealt with effectively by States acting alone. Sometimes
they require new international law, but more specifically
they require political will to defeat them and to foster
cooperation among nations to ensure maximum
effectiveness of action.
The United Nations is the ideal environment in which
to develop such cooperation. It is here that the world is
represented. We have here a tradition of debate, of
discussion, of identification of problems and of consensus.
We have the ability to make law when it is necessary.
Above all, we have pledged ourselves to defending and
providing a decent standard of living to the peoples we
represent.
There is also a regional role and, in that context,
Australia was pleased to have promoted the concept of a
regional HIV/AIDS ministers’ meeting at the Post-
Ministerial Conference of this year’s session of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations.
As we move towards the twenty-first century, it will
be crucial to the execution of that responsibility to ensure
that we have a healthy United Nations that is devoted to
international cooperation aimed at defeating the major
non-military threats to the security of the human family.
These threats are tragically evident to us today. They will
only become larger if we do not agree, now, to begin
cooperative action to defeat them. History will surely
judge our generation harshly if, having identified the
problems of human security, we fail for lack of will to
address their solutions.
Another great requirement of our times is the
economic needs of people and the promotion of
development. Much has been done through the United
Nations and its agencies to advance the development
cause. They have been pivotal to the emergence of a
multilateral approach in which institutions with special
competencies such as the specialized agencies, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
together with policy deliberative bodies such as the
General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council,
have complementary roles to play.
Development is about more than just economic
growth, however. There is also the need for internal
stability, sound environmental management, a vigorous
civil society and a lively democracy. The United Nations
is uniquely placed to build consensus on how to advance
these various elements of the development agenda.
In this context, Australia welcomes the constructive
outcomes achieved at the ninth session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) held in Midrand, South Africa, earlier this
year. The decisions taken there should help developing
countries benefit from the opportunities of economic
globalization.
We also underline the importance of encouraging
investment and technology transfers and providing trade
opportunities to stimulate economic development. Such
1


development is the only enduring foundation for
independence and economic and social well-being.
It is in Africa that these development challenges are
most stark. Rich in promise yet wearied by emergencies,
Africa stands today at a decisive juncture in its history.
African leaders seized the moment with the
Organization of African Unity’s 1995 Cairo Agenda for
Action, in which they called for immediate action to
implement the development strategies for which an
international consensus now exists. The United Nations
responded this year with the launch of a 10-year,
$25 billion United Nations System-wide Special Initiative
for Africa.
The Australian Government welcomes the Special
Initiative as a concrete demonstration of the international
community’s concern with Africa. The international
community cannot allow disease, poverty, war and
underdevelopment to become entrenched in the 53
nations — almost one-third of United Nations Member
States — that make up the African continent.
The world must continue to seek ways to break the
poverty cycle in Africa so that its potential for economic
development is realized. Sustainable economic development
is essential to overcome poverty, disease and conflict.
The United Nations system needs to give greater focus
and impetus to the development effort in Africa.
I now turn to the issue of human rights. Human rights
are important in international relations for two main
reasons: first, political instability and major conflict can
result where human rights are breached or are under threat;
and secondly, the freedom and dignity of individuals is, in
itself, of fundamental value to the world community.
The Australian Government aims for practical
outcomes that will improve the lives of individual men,
women and children. We recognize the importance of
dialogue and cooperation, based on mutual respect. In
addition to public and private diplomacy, Australia’s
approach to the improvement of human rights also
encompasses development cooperation.
Australia strongly supports the development of strong
and independent national human rights institutions. For
example, Australia provided financial support for a
workshop of Asia-Pacific national human rights institutions,
which agreed to establish an informal forum to work for the
strengthening and further development of such institutions
in the region. Australia has also provided financial
support to the United Nations for the creation of a
position of special adviser to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights on national human
rights institutions.
Finally, it is important to address the issue of reform
of the United Nations. Much work still needs to be done
to bring about greater efficiency and effectiveness in the
United Nations and its specialized agencies.
While Australia applauds the dedication and hard
work of the General Assembly Working Groups that were
set up in 1995, Member States must not lose sight of the
fact that to achieve real change, the Groups have to come
up with realistic and achievable recommendations. Those
recommendations must in turn lead to practical and
measurable outcomes.
It is important that the work of the groups be
focused and that their momentum be restored so that early
and positive outcomes can be achieved. We must all
commit ourselves to this end and to bringing about
structured change within the United Nations.
It is also crucial that the financial situation of the
United Nations be repaired. Australia believes that all
Members should pay their contributions in full and on
time. We therefore welcome recent moves by some
countries to pay their arrears.
It is time to establish a revised scale of assessed
contributions that more fairly reflects what Governments
can pay. The current minimum payment is too high for
many small-economy countries, and Australia would like
to see it reduced or even removed.
These are the reforms that Australia believes are
necessary to equip the United Nations for its role in the
twenty-first century.
It is in this overall context that Australia is deeply
committed to contributing to the United Nations goal of
maintaining international peace and security in an active
way. Serving a term as a non-permanent member of the
Security Council during 1997-1998 would enable
Australia to make a substantive contribution to that goal
and to work for a more effective, modernized and
transparent Council. That is why we have asked for the
support of Member States at the elections to be held a
few weeks from now.
13


Let me conclude by summing up what I have said
today. The United Nations is unique and needed, but it
must pursue, and work on the basis of, a relevant Agenda.
This is the central point. The United Nations must be put
to work on the agenda of the twenty-first century.
Much work needs to be done to tackle the key
challenges that face the United Nations. Only a sustained,
cooperative effort among all Member States will bring
success. Australia will make that effort.



"
1473,51,1996,PNG,"﻿On behalf of
the people and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I
congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to preside
over the General Assembly at its fifty-first session. The
warm relations that have developed between our two
nations make it a particular pleasure to welcome you to
your high office and to wish you well in carrying out
your duties. I would also like to record our sincere
appreciation for the wise leadership with which your
predecessor guided our deliberations during the historic
fiftieth session of the General Assembly.
The rapid approach of the year 2000 raises the
question whether — and how — we are going to try to
make the turn of the century a turning point for the
United Nations. Despite the many thought-provoking
speeches made for the fiftieth anniversary, I regret to say
that signs of fundamental and far-reaching changes
required remain elusive. Yet we live at a time when the
only constant factor is change. The preamble to its
Charter makes it quite clear that the United Nations itself
was — and is — intended to be an agent of change. If
our Organization is to remain relevant to the challenges
ahead, then it, and we the Members, must adapt and keep
on adapting, as the world continues to change.
Invented to raise humanity’s sights beyond the
horizon of destruction caused by world war, the United
Nations must be continuously reinvented in order to play
an effective role in a rapidly changing world. The United
Nations has in fact been successful at one kind of change:
adding to our agenda responsibilities and activities in
areas such as peacekeeping, peacemaking, human rights
and sustainable development. It has, however, been very
much less successful in rationalizing its operations and
administrative support.
Humanity needs a much more focused, trim and vital
United Nations. Without internal reform, the risk of
overload is only too real — and, arguably, overload is
already here. Even more importantly, we, the Members of
the United Nations, have to do more, much more, to
adapt key institutions to the changed and still-changing
circumstances of a post-colonial, post-cold-war world.
Almost everyone agrees what the main issues and
options are. Yet as far as its permanent membership goes,
the Security Council in particular remains, much as it has
always been, the product of decisions made before most
Member States became independent. Some of the
strongest critics of the cost and alleged inefficiencies
of the United Nations come from States that are among
the slowest in paying their membership dues. While
they criticize weaknesses in the Organization’s
performance, they are often among the most eager
4


advocates of giving it new assignments. Their
actions — and inaction — suggest that they confuse
cutbacks in the resources available to the United Nations
with real reform.
Like other members of the Non-Aligned Movement,
Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to reforming the
Security Council. While we recognize that those whom
existing arrangements most favour are well placed to delay
or block change, we firmly believe that the Council’s
composition should be altered. It must take better account
of the geographical distribution and sovereign equality of
Member States. Concerned that it seems to be taking longer
to reform than it originally took to form the United Nations,
Papua New Guinea’s voice and vote are emphatically for
change. We believe that the time for action is now.
Papua New Guinea has embarked on an ambitious
programme of domestic reforms, including both
constitutional and economic-policy changes. Having
legislated a new system of provincial and local-level
governments in order to improve the delivery of services to
our people, we are actively engaged in implementation.
Twenty-one years after giving ourselves a “home-grown”
Constitution, we are now engaged in a comprehensive
process of reform that is equally “home-grown”.
My Government is just as determined to bring about
comprehensive structural adjustment. Following decisions
to devalue and float our national currency, the kina, we are
now reducing the size of the public sector. We are making
the official interface with the private sector more
business-friendly and encouraging commercial enterprise.
While international agencies and foreign aid donors provide
valuable support, the impulse, direction and pace of reform
are emphatically Papua New Guinea’s own. Being a
member of the Government that led Papua New Guinea to
its independence, I cannot allow our national sovereignty —
or our Government’s ability to respond to our people’s
needs — to be compromised now.
Experience of the difficulties of reform at home has
reinforced my Government’s commitment to reforming the
United Nations. The principles remain the same. We
strongly support efforts to ensure that the world has a truly
effective, flexible and responsive Organization through
which to cooperate in meeting the challenges of the twenty-
first century.
The United Nations is founded on the idea that
security involves much more than military defence against
threats of armed attack. Conscious of the threats and
limitations on self-defence that we face together with
other small island developing countries, Papua New
Guinea has always regarded collective security as an
important key to national security. Diplomacy is the
means by which we seek to cooperate with all other
States committed to peace.
As the current Chairman of the Melanesian
Spearhead Group (MSG), I am pleased to report that we
welcomed Fiji as a new member at our Summit in June.
We also adopted a document — “Melanesia Beyond
2000” — which outlines our objectives and strategy for
the MSG’s second decade.
We have emphasized our commitment to cooperation
on a wide basis and have also agreed to a proposal on
weapons control. The South Pacific Forum is developing
the idea on a region-wide basis. Following the extreme
outrage that the South Pacific felt when France resumed
its testing programme in French Polynesia last year, I can
now report that the programme has ceased. The remaining
nuclear Powers with interests in our region — France, the
United Kingdom and the United States of America —
have signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty
(Treaty of Rarotonga). France has been readmitted as a
post-Forum dialogue partner.
As much as we welcome the developments during
the past 12 months, Papua New Guinea believes that
more is required before our region can be described as
genuinely nuclear-free. Outstanding needs include a
broader treaty, systematic monitoring of former test-sites,
cleaning up, compensation and the provision of alternative
sources of income for the people of French Polynesia.
The Treaty of Rarotonga is complemented by the
MSG’s Lakatoro Declaration on Denuclearization in
Oceania. Subregional and regional efforts are again
complemented by similar arrangements negotiated during
the past year in South-East Asia and Africa, as well as by
the much older arrangements that apply to Antarctica and
Latin America. Papua New Guinea welcomes the
Brazilian proposal to link these arrangements into a
comprehensive nuclear-weapon-free zone covering the
entire southern hemisphere. Having supported the recent
passage of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,
we would now like to see it extended to outlawing
simulations, limiting the development and acquisition of
new nuclear weapons and, ultimately, bringing about
complete disarmament.
5


The South Pacific Forum has expressed support for the
early conclusion of negotiations over a legal regime
covering civil liability for nuclear damage.
Committed to furthering cooperation against threats to
our region, the South Pacific Forum is working on an
arrangement through which member States can respond to
legitimate requests for assistance from one another’s
disciplined services, including police. The same
arrangement could also be used for consultations intended
to help prevent, manage and settle disputes. We continue to
broaden, deepen and diversify other areas of security
cooperation, including law enforcement.
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional
level, Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive
code of logging practice designed to promote the
sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich
renewable natural resource.
We are gravely concerned at the threat that climate
change poses to the very survival of low-lying atolls. Entire
countries in our region face the risk of extinction. Papua
New Guinea joins with other developing countries in calling
on the advanced industrialized countries to look beyond
their immediate self-interest and adopt specific targets for
reducing greenhouse emissions, an issue which generates
considerable emotion among us.
Together with other coastal States in the region, we
look to distant-water fishing nations for cooperation in
giving effect to the United Nations Agreement on straddling
fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks so that it does
not weaken existing regional arrangements.
In the wider Asia-Pacific region, Papua New Guinea
calls for a reduction of avoidable sources of stress,
uncertainty and risk on the Korean Peninsula, both for the
sake of the countries directly involved and because of their
potentially adverse effects on other countries.
Concerned about events earlier in the year, I repeat
last year’s call for the United Nations to do its best to ease
the tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Important regional organizations in the Asia-Pacific have
found ways of following the principle within the region.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution
recommending that the United Nations identify options for
Taiwan to take part in the activities of bodies answerable to
the General Assembly. The United Nations has an
obligation to assist in maintaining a secure environment in
which economic growth and other forms of development
can continue for the benefit of the peoples of the region
as well as their partners around the world. It is therefore
time to address the question of Taiwanese participation in
institutions and processes set up to further the universal
objectives of the United Nations Charter.
Respect for the national sovereignty of Member
States is basic to the United Nations Charter. Small island
developing countries tend to be especially vulnerable to
a wide range of possible threats. Their development, and
even their very survival, often depend on international
cooperation and law.
Having achieved national independence under United
Nations supervision, Papua New Guinea is firmly
committed to the United Nations Special Committee on
the Situation With Regard to the Implementation of the
Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial
Countries and Peoples. Despite criticism from certain
quarters, we were therefore pleased to welcome and host
the Special Committee’s regional seminar held in Port
Moresby in June. Together with all other members of the
Melanesian Spearhead Group and the South Pacific
Forum, we remain firmly committed to the orderly
decolonization of New Caledonia, with special safeguards
for the indigenous Kanaks. We will not accept illegitimate
attempts to delay or derail complete implementation of
the Matignon Agreements. Having reviewed the French
Government’s record elsewhere in the region, we ask
ourselves whether French Polynesia, as well as Walis and
Futuna, should be included in the United Nations list of
Non-Self-Governing Territories. The international
community has a duty to see that France meets its
responsibilities to the people of our region and a prime
responsibility must be the right of self-determination.
On Bougainville, my Government is firmly
committed to doing all that we can to resolve the crisis
that has racked the Bougainville Province in my country
since 1989. I therefore negotiated a cease-fire, arranged
a regional peacekeeping force and agreed to peace talks
in October 1994, only to find that the militant leaders
would not honour the agreements reached. Even so, my
Government has been prepared to talk to those who will
talk to us. We have established the Bougainville
Transitional Government and continue to provide
protection for people forced to flee from their homes by
the criminal actions of an armed and militant minority.
We continue to restore services and to encourage
reconciliation, but the mounting toll of destruction, injury
and loss of life caused by the militants gave the National
6


Government no alternative but to lift the ceasefire on 21
March this year.
Even now, rival gangs of armed criminals continue to
threaten the lives of innocent people, trying to destroy what
the people, provincial leaders and the national Government
are doing and reconstructing. They undermine all efforts to
maintain the rule of law. In a particularly barbaric attack on
8 September this year, 12 members of our security forces
were killed at the Kangu Care Centre in South
Bougainville.
Despite the worst efforts of the Bougainville
Revolutionary Army and its sympathizers abroad, my
Government is standing firm. We will not give them the
satisfaction of departing from our basic objective of
restoring peace and rebuilding all they have destroyed.
We appreciate the understanding displayed by the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights when it
considered the Bougainville situation earlier this year. It has
always been a complex domestic issue. In keeping with the
mutual respect for national sovereignty that is basic to
international law, Papua New Guinea calls on all other
States to refrain from statements and actions that send
misleading signals to those who violate our laws; to
cooperate in preventing smuggling and other illegal
violations of our borders; and generally to prevent outsiders
from interfering illegally in Papua New Guinea’s internal
affairs. In so doing, we add the reminder that it is not the
foreign meddlers who will suffer most from the effects of
the crisis — it will be the people of Papua New Guinea,
including the overwhelming majority of Bougainvilleans,
who consider themselves to be part of our nation and
entitled to the same rights as all other Papua New
Guineans.
Conscious of the violations that have occurred on all
sides and of the need to avoid any repetition, my
Government is in the process of trying to strengthen
existing arrangements by establishing a national commission
on human rights.
My Government has embarked on an ambitious
programme of structural adjustment, because we — and not
some outside body — think that we should in order to
ensure that development can be sustained for future
generations. While we accept external advice and appreciate
external assistance, we have not yielded to, and will not
give in to, external pressure. It is crucial that the official
conduct of such bodies not raise basic questions about
relations between these institutions and the sovereignty of
the member States that they are supposed to serve.
National and collective self-reliance are both means
of achieving and integral to the objective of sustainable
development. They are critical to maintaining and
strengthening the security and sovereignty of States.
National self-reliance is among Papua New Guinea’s
constitutional goals and directive principles. Collective
self-reliance through South Pacific cooperation is among
the commitments contained in my Government’s Pacific
Plan and implemented through our current national
budget.
My Government’s proposal that Papua New Guinea
should enter into a form of permanent association with
the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is
intended to further the process by which we cooperate
with neighbouring countries to promote collective
self-reliance. We appreciate the positive interest that
ASEAN members have expressed in the idea and we
strongly support closer cooperation between ASEAN and
the South Pacific Forum.
As the only Pacific island country directly involved
in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
(APEC), but by no means the only such country likely to
be affected by the process, Papua New Guinea has
proposed that APEC set up a scheme to help build
capacity among the 13 small island developing countries
in the region so that they are not left or pushed behind.
The proposal that we are now developing in greater
detail is emphatically not intended to be yet another
open-ended aid programme under a different name.
Rather, it is intended to help small island countries
manage their way through the transition to the
achievement of APEC’s vision of open-ended regional
free trade by the year 2020.
As an active participant in institutions established
under the Lomé Convention, Papua New Guinea would
like to encourage other member States to give early
consideration to the kinds of changes that would facilitate
development processes and objectives consistent with
World Trade Organization rules.
Conscious of the aid fatigue now spreading through
many advanced industrial countries, we urge Governments
and people of goodwill to recognize the time and effort
that development requires. With a few very honourable
exceptions, donor countries have not reached — and in
7


many cases have fallen far behind — aid targets to which
they agreed a generation ago.
Thus, not only has aid been reduced, but recipients are
even more locked and tied to donors’ own preferences. The
effect that the failure to honour commitments can have on
national forward planning can be very severe. It underlines
the need for a reduced reliance on aid and for the
development of a greater degree of self-reliance.
In view of the vital role that the business sector can
play in mobilizing capital for investment and trade, we
welcome schemes designed to assist in the development of
the private sector. We especially welcome the contributions
made to such schemes by the advanced industrial countries.
We cannot achieve all our reforms without the support
of world institutions. That is accepted. However, those
institutions themselves need to operate with greater
flexibility and to be more sensitive to the particular needs
of Governments to preserve democracy, the environment
and their people’s national identity and culture.
My Government takes a global view of Papua New
Guinea’s foreign relations and of issues on the United
Nations agenda. We encourage official agencies, business
and non-governmental organizations both to “Look North”
and to “Work the Pacific” for mutual benefit with close
neighbours. Conscious that we must not overlook
longstanding friends, we give high priority to reinforcing
core relationships. Our overall objective is to continue
reform at home in order to meet the challenges of global
change.
We will continue to support wider efforts at reform,
including those directed at and through the United Nations,
in order to meet the challenges of global change and
embrace the imperatives of reform in readiness for the
twenty-first century.









"
1503,51,1996,NZL,"﻿It gives me particular
pleasure to address the General Assembly at a session of
over which Malaysia has been elected to preside. Our two
countries are good friends, and Ambassador Razali is
personally known to and respected by us all. New Zealand
looks forward to a productive session under his leadership.
In just two weeks New Zealanders face a general
election. There are many subjects over which the various
political parties differ, but one thing remains quite clear: the
support of New Zealanders for the United Nations and the
rule of international law embodied in it.
For New Zealand, as for many other countries
represented here today — and especially smaller
countries — the primary purpose of the United Nations
remains to provide for a system of collective security. It
brings the nations of the world together in a grand coalition
to keep the peace, to help eliminate weapons of mass
destruction, to uphold human rights, to encourage good
governance, to protect the environment and to promote
economic and social development, including by
supporting the role of women.
Together, these activities, along with national and
regional initiatives, provide the underpinnings of the
system of collective security that we want to leave for our
children.
For New Zealanders, our confidence in the United
Nations was reaffirmed when, two weeks ago, the General
Assembly adopted the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty. It gave me much satisfaction to sign the Treaty
earlier today on behalf of the Government and the people
of New Zealand. Agreement on a test ban has been a
New Zealand objective for more than three decades and
one we promoted in this Assembly, together with
Australia and Mexico. It reflects deeply held convictions
on the part of all New Zealanders.
New Zealand has argued, and will continue to argue,
for a world without nuclear weapons. Our belief that
these weapons of mass destruction can and should be
eliminated has been reinforced by the experiences of our
region as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. I am glad
to say it is an era now happily behind us.
For New Zealand, the Treaty represents first of all
an end to nuclear testing in our region and worldwide.
But even more, it puts real obstacles in the way of any
State seeking to refine or develop a nuclear arsenal. We


have taken a significant step on the way to eliminating
nuclear weapons entirely. Now, however, we must look
ahead.
The International Court of Justice, in its recent
Advisory Opinion on the legality of the use or threat of use
of nuclear weapons, set out our obligation in this regard:
the obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a
conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament.
New Zealand believes that in 1997 all States, including
nuclear-weapon States, should pursue negotiations on a
phased programme of nuclear disarmament, with the
ultimate goals of the complete elimination of nuclear
weapons and a treaty on general and complete disarmament
under strict and effective international control.
We are better placed to make our contribution to such
negotiations because of the recent decision of the
Conference on Disarmament to admit New Zealand and 22
other countries as full members. As a reflection of the
importance we attach to its ongoing work, my Government
has now decided to appoint a full-time Disarmament
Ambassador to the Conference in Geneva.
Further steps towards a nuclear-free world are
recommended in the report of the Canberra Commission on
the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, released last month.
We hope that report will energize discussions at the
national level, particularly in the nuclear-weapon States.
The aspirations of many States to be free of nuclear
weapons have found expression in the establishment of
what are now four nuclear-weapon-free zones. Taken
together, the four relevant treaties have the potential to
cover some 114 nations and 1.7 billion people. My
Government has given considerable thought to ways in
which cooperation between nuclear-weapon-free zones can
be advanced. We are working with other Governments on
a draft resolution to be submitted to the Assembly at this
session, and New Zealand hopes it will receive wide
support.
The disarmament arena is only one where the United
Nations must continue to address serious challenges to our
collective security. When my Government took office in
October 1990, the international community faced the
challenge presented by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. In the
heart of Europe, Yugoslavia was on the path to political
disintegration. Few of us imagined then, however, the
nightmare of Bosnia, the genocide to come in Rwanda or
the mass starvation and anarchy in Somalia. In response,
during our term on the Security Council in 1993 and 1994,
a record 75,000 United Nations peacekeepers were
deployed around the world, and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait
was robustly countered by coalition action authorized by
the Security Council. New Zealand was part of that
coalition and is part of the current efforts to ensure that
Iraq complies with subsequent Council decisions. Recent
events show that we still need to be vigilant. Iraq must
recognize that there are limits to what the international
community will tolerate.
New Zealanders also serve in the former Yugoslavia
where, while the implementation of the Dayton accords
lies primarily with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), the United Nations continues to play an
important role. Similarly, our personnel serve in Angola
and the Middle East.
New Zealanders are staunch supporters of the United
Nations role in international peacekeeping, despite the fact
that the overall record through the first half of this decade
has been mixed. There were successes, such as Cambodia,
Mozambique and El Salvador, and there were the
disappointments and bitter frustrations of Bosnia, Somalia
and Rwanda. I hesitate to call those operations failures.
To me, that would be to overlook the positive things they
achieved in extremely difficult circumstances and the
contributions made by so many dedicated and able people.
Those operations will be failures only if we fail to learn
from them. I think we have learned.
We have learned that, first, the United Nations must
be given the resources required to do the job. Secondly,
the Organization must be careful about mixing
enforcement tasks with peacekeeping, unless our
peacekeepers are appropriately configured from the outset
for the higher level of threat.
Thirdly, the Security Council should be wary of
adopting resolutions to which the Organization cannot
give effect. This creates a very corrosive credibility
problem.
My Government also considers that the United
Nations must continue its efforts to develop a capacity to
respond more rapidly. We commend the proposal to
establish a rapidly deployable operational headquarters
team and, indeed, have offered to contribute a highly
experienced officer to it.
Demining remains an important focus for New
Zealand. Mines pose an unacceptable threat to
peacekeeping operations and are a longer-term
2


humanitarian and development challenge. The United
Nations must make every effort to ensure that the necessary
resources are available for demining activities.
We have more than doubled our annual instalment to
the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in
Mine Clearance. This is in addition to our continuing
contribution of expertise in demining in Cambodia,
Mozambique and Angola, as well as here at United Nations
Headquarters.
Finally, we do not think the United Nations can write
itself out of the script when operations involving a potential
enforcement dimension are contemplated. If it did so, it
could quickly become irrelevant. The threats to international
peace and security in the future are likely to be every bit as
difficult as those of the recent past. The United Nations will
need to be able to respond effectively, not simply as a
rubber stamp for great-Power actions.
The tragic events of recent days in the West Bank and
Gaza show that peace there remains elusive. New Zealand
calls upon all parties to desist from actions that might derail
the Middle East peace process. Painstaking efforts have
gone into that process, and it offers a real hope for a long-
term solution to the problems that have bedeviled that
region. It must be supported and not jeopardized.
Human rights are the foundation of freedom and
justice, and the achievement of universal respect for human
rights is an essential prerequisite for international peace and
security.
In New Zealand we work hard to ensure that our own
house is in order. We are committed to ensuring that the
rights elaborated in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, the Covenants and other core human rights
instruments are a living reality for all New Zealanders, and
we are prepared to speak out when we see human rights
being violated in other parts of the world. At its heart, our
international human rights policy is geared to finding
tangible ways of protecting and promoting human rights
and good government.
In the Asia-Pacific region we are pleased by the
progress the United Nations is making in nurturing human
rights frameworks. We are also encouraged by the new
levels of cooperation and interaction being achieved by the
human rights commissions of the region.
New Zealand also sees a need to support individual
countries, international and regional organizations and non-
governmental organizations in their work to improve
human rights and the quality of governance. To this end
the Minister for Foreign Affairs has today announced the
establishment of an international good-government
programme. This new programme will markedly expand
our ability to support good government and human rights
capacity-building activities. It will work in tandem with
the existing Commonwealth Good Government Fund.
Consistent with United Nations principles, New
Zealand has also participated actively in the Action Group
of Commonwealth Ministers for the promotion of
principles of good governance established at the
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting at Harare
in 1991 and reaffirmed at its Auckland meeting in 1995.
For my own part, I have been privileged to represent New
Zealand at several of the Action Group’s meetings and
during its recent mission to Gambia.
Such programmes, with the interlinked goals of
social progress and economic development, do not come
cheaply. The money spent on United Nations relief and
development greatly surpasses that spent on peacekeeping,
and so it should.
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 it
was recognized that substantial new and additional
funding would be required for sustainable development
and the implementation of Agenda 21, the programme of
action that will take us into the next century.
I am pleased to be able to say that by next year New
Zealand will have increased its official development
assistance by almost one third since Rio. There will be a
24 per cent increase in our funding for United Nations
development agencies this year.
1997 will see the five-year review of Agenda 21. At
the special session of the General Assembly next June,
one important task will be to assess the effectiveness of
the bodies and institutions that have been established to
advance the aims set out in Agenda 21. The issues are
many, and all are important. But we need to focus efforts
and produce real results.
In this regard, the Commission on Sustainable
Development should have a strengthened role. It should
be the forum in which States can work to streamline the
environment-and-sustainable- development agenda.
All these challenges facing this unique Organization,
and our regard for it, highlight of course the urgent need
3


for reform. In particular, the Security Council must be
made more representative of the Organization’s membership
as it is today, not as it was 50 years ago. Its decision-
making procedures must be brought up to date.
Finding a sustainable basis for the financing of the
Organization remains long overdue. New Zealand has
dedicated itself to reform of both the Secretariat and the
intergovernmental machinery, not least through our
vigorous commitment to the work of the Open-ended High-
level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United
Nations System. The report of that group provides a
blueprint for action during this session. We also support the
Efficiency Board, and have made available to it the services
of a New Zealand expert in public-service restructuring.
We believe that New Zealand’s record, not only as a
prompt contributor of assessments, but also as a country
that has demonstrated its commitment to financial reform,
places it in a good position to make an effective
contribution to the work of the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in which we are
seeking membership at this year’s session of the General
Assembly.
The drive for reform of the United Nations system to
make it an effective instrument of the international
community for the next 50 years means no part of it can
remain immune from scrutiny.
A good deal of attention has been focused on the
Security Council, the General Assembly and the Secretariat.
We believe there is also scope for increasing the
effectiveness of the International Court of Justice. It is 50
years since the ICJ was established as the principal United
Nations judicial organ. To mark this important milestone in
the international rule of law, we should now finally
schedule a conference to adopt the statute for the
international criminal court. The creation of a permanent
court that will bring justice to victims of genocide, crimes
against humanity, war crimes and other serious international
crimes is surely a priority for us all.
I am grateful to have had this opportunity to reaffirm
New Zealand’s commitment to this Organization, and to
multilateralism, as the means for building a better world.






"
1525,51,1996,MHL,"﻿I wish to take this
opportunity on behalf of His Excellency President Amata
Kabua and the Government and the people of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands to thank and to
acknowledge the leadership of the outgoing President,
Professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral, and also to
congratulate you, Ambassador Razali Ismail, on your
well-deserved election to the high office of the Presidency
of the General Assembly.
I am pleased to inform you, Sir, that at the recently
concluded South Pacific Forum meeting in the Republic
of the Marshall Islands, your country, Malaysia, was
invited to join the post-forum dialogue next year as a
partner, where we hope to further our cooperation.
In our capacity as Chairman of the South Pacific
Forum, I have the honour first to make some remarks of
a regional nature on behalf of the Forum members that
are also United Nations Members, followed by some
remarks of a more national perspective.
The South Pacific Forum held its twenty-seventh
meeting last month in Majuro, the capital of the Republic
of the Marshall Islands. The theme for this session,
“Pacific Solidarity for the Common Good”, highlights one
of the important building blocks of our regional
cooperation towards sustainable development. The Forum
leaders reviewed a broad range of measures in the area of
economic reform and development. These and other
important decisions of the South Pacific Forum leaders
are contained in the Forum communiqué, which has been
submitted to the Secretary-General and will be circulated
as an official United Nations document.
In his opening remarks to the Forum at Majuro, the
President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, His
Excellency Mr. Amata Kabua, emphasized the unity and
the harmony of the nations gathered at the meeting, which
traversed immense ocean barriers. The restraining pull of
national interests and cultural differences are all
harmonized — fine-tuned, so to speak — into a single sea
of unity. It is through this unity that seemingly
insurmountable obstacles or intractable problems can be
resolved. In deliberating on and reviewing their respective
performances together and charting the way towards a
prosperous and secure future for the region, the Forum
leaders gave deeper meaning to the theme of this year’s
session.
I wish to make some remarks about the outcome of
those discussions. Climate change is a global problem that
5


requires a global solution. The Forum has again highlighted
its concern over climate change and called for urgent action
in view of the second assessment report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which states
that the balance of scientific evidence suggests a discernible
human influence on the global climate. This report has
given us much to be concerned about, and the Forum
countries call on the international community to accelerate
negotiations at the next conference of the parties.
The international community needs to achieve
significant progress towards the goal of lowering
greenhouse gas emissions in the near future. The survival
of many small island developing States, as well as many
other developing States that are adversely affected in some
way by climate change depends upon our taking action. We
will all be adversely affected by climate change. For this
reason we reaffirm our full support for the alliance of small
island States protocol in the context of the discussions of
the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate, which calls for
stronger carbon dioxide reductions in a time-bound
framework.
During this session of the General Assembly we will
review progress on a number of related issues under the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
including fisheries conservation and management and
efforts to reduce the incidence of illegal fishing practices.
We will also reiterate the importance that our region has
placed on the effectiveness of an international legal regime
for oceans and their resources, including, in our view,
providing adequate financial resources to the International
Seabed Authority in Kingston, Jamaica.
The Forum leaders underscored the importance that
the Pacific fish stocks have for international trade and our
livelihood. We recognize that this important resource must
be managed sustainably to maximize its benefits to our
region. In this connection, the Forum leaders have
requested our regional experts to develop comprehensive
agreements for the sustainable management of the region’s
fisheries across the full geographical range of the stocks,
including the high seas, taking into account the Agreement
on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks
opened for signature here in New York last year. The
Republic of the Marshall Islands has offered to host a
second High-level Multilateral Consultation on the
Conservation and Management of Fisheries Resources of
the Central Western Pacific next year to advance this
process. This ministerial meeting will discuss a number of
issues, including restocking, greater involvement of the
distant-water-fishing nations in conservation and
management, data gathering on the range of the stocks,
and transshipments.
The Forum leaders are also committed to the review
and appraisal of Agenda 21, which will take place at the
special session of the General Assembly next year.
Mechanisms have been established for regional dialogue,
partnership and participation in the development of
concrete proposals for action regarding the progress made
since the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development in 1992. The Forum has asked its Advisory
Committee to coordinate these tasks and make
preparations to submit reports to that special session. In
this respect I wish to call on our development partners to
support the efforts of the Forum countries and our
regional organizations, so that the special session will be
a thorough and comprehensive review. But in this regard,
we caution against a proliferation of organizations and
meetings when the concerted efforts of the international
community should be focused on practical measures,
which will improve on the efforts under way at the
regional level. It is problematic for our administrations,
with limited resources, to cover too many meetings
dealing with the same topics, and we fear that
unnecessary duplication may occur as a result.
We will report to that session on a number of
initiatives, following on from the report submitted to the
Commission on Sustainable Development in 1996 by the
South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme
(SPREP). In our region we recognize the importance of
the multiple role that forests have, and the need for a
comprehensive approach by the international community
to the sustainable management and conservation of all
types of forests. For our part in sustainable forests
management, the Forum endorsed a South Pacific Code
of Conduct for Logging of Indigenous Forests in selected
South Pacific Forum countries. Also, in the light of the
fact that 1997 will be the Year of the Coral Reef in the
Pacific, we hope to include progress reports on the
implementation of coastal-zone-management strategies.
The international community took steps at the
Barbados Conference to acknowledge the special situation
and interests of small island developing States. We stress
the need to give particular attention to the comprehensive
Programme of Action produced at that Conference, and to
have the special needs of small island developing States
adequately addressed in the United Nations development
efforts. In its review of Agenda 21 the special session
6


should lay the grounds for further international cooperation,
national and regional initiative, and the mobilization of
resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of
small island developing States.
I wish to raise some of issues of political significance
for our region. The Forum commended progress by France
and parties in New Caledonia on the implementation of the
Matignon Agreements. It welcomed the recent reception
accorded to the Ministerial Mission from the Forum
countries by the French and New Caledonian authorities.
Forum countries encourage all parties to continue dialogue
in the search for a durable solution to the question of the
territory’s long-term future.
I wish to inform the General Assembly that the Forum
has reaffirmed its strong and unanimous support for
Australia’s candidature for the Security Council in this
year’s election. Furthermore, in recognition of the
importance of Japan as a constructive partner for the region,
the Forum also expressed strong and unanimous support for
the candidature of Japan at the same election.
The Forum expressed satisfaction at the permanent
cessation of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
This marked the end of all nuclear testing in a region that
had been subjected to both atmospheric and underground
testing for five decades. China’s recent announcement of a
moratorium on nuclear testing meant that all five nuclear-
weapon States were now observing testing moratoriums
long urged by the Forum. Earlier this month the General
Assembly took action to adopt and open for signature a
comprehensive test-ban Treaty (CTBT). This was an effort
fully supported by the Forum, and the resolution was
sponsored by all the United Nations members of the Forum.
We are pleased with the passage of resolution 50/78, and
urge all States to join with us in signing and ratifying the
CTBT as soon as possible, to facilitate the Treaty’s earliest
implementation.
We should recall the Advisory Opinion tendered by
the International Court of Justice on the legality of the
threat or use of nuclear weapons, which recognized that all
members of the international community have an obligation
to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion
negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its
aspects under strict and effective international control. The
Forum leaders urged all States concerned, particularly the
nuclear-weapon States, to continue meaningful negotiations
with a view to further significant reductions of nuclear
stockpiles in the near future as a step towards the ultimate
elimination of nuclear weapons.
They also warmly welcomed the signature and
ratification by Vanuatu of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free
Zone Treaty, the signature of Tonga, and the signing of
the protocols to the Treaty by France, the United
Kingdom and the United States of America. As a result
of these developments, all States within the Treaty area
have now given their support to the Treaty, and all five
nuclear-weapon States have undertaken to respect its
provisions. We welcome the ratification by France of the
protocols. The Forum also urged early ratification of the
protocols by the United Kingdom and the United States
of America.
The Forum leaders were encouraged by the
establishment since their last meeting of two nuclear-
weapon-free zones: in South-East Asia and Africa.
Leaders noted with satisfaction that these developments
represented progress with respect to the decisions
accompanying the indefinite extension in 1995 of the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In
this context, Forum leaders expressed support for an
appropriate resolution at this session of the United
Nations General Assembly whereby signatory States of
the southern hemisphere nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties
and other members of the international community could
affirm their support for these zones and cooperate in the
furtherance of the goals of these zones and of nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament.
The Forum again reaffirmed the existence of a
special responsibility towards those peoples of the former
United Nations Trust Territory administered by the United
States, the Marshall Islands, which was adversely affected
as a result of nuclear-weapon tests conducted during the
period of the trusteeship. This responsibility includes the
safe resettlement of displaced human populations and the
restoration to economic productivity of affected areas.
The Forum wishes again to raise concerns over
shipments of plutonium and radioactive wastes through
our region. These shipments must be carried out in
accordance with the strictest international safety and
security standards. All contingencies must be fully
addressed, and full consultation must be carried out with
the countries of the regions through which the shipments
will occur.
I now wish to make some comments on behalf of
my national delegation.
In regard to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty (CTBT), it is important that countries that were
7


severely affected by nuclear testing play a role in the 51-
member Executive Council being envisaged within the
CTBT framework to oversee all aspects of the
implementation of the Treaty. I wish to reiterate that the
Republic of the Marshall Islands stands ready to present its
candidacy for that Council, once established.
We are grateful to President Clinton and his
Administration for their transparent policy of disclosing
previously classified information relating to the nuclear-
testing programme in the Marshall Islands. We also wish to
thank our friends and supporters in the United States
Congress for their assistance. We hope that our cooperation
continues to improve and that the process of disclosure is
accelerated. All the information pertaining to the nuclear-
testing programme should be provided to my Government,
in order that we may fully comprehend the implications for
our planning for the health and well-being of our citizens
and our environment.
The Government of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands has recently learned that the damage caused by
nuclear-weapon-test programmes during the trusteeship is
far greater and more horrible than originally disclosed. The
radiation released by all 67 nuclear-weapon tests is
currently known to affect more atolls and more groups of
people than previously disclosed, as reported by the White
House Advisory Committee on Human Radiation
Experiments. The health, environment, medical, social and
economic consequences resulting from the effects of the
radiation released remains a major concern for the
Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. As a
result, at our current level of knowledge the costs related to
the effects of radiation make it very hard to properly treat
and care for the people who have, and continue to show,
radiation-related illnesses. This also applies to programmes
related to the rehabilitation of contaminated islands and the
safe resettlement of affected communities.
We cannot solve these problems on our own, and we
feel obliged to appeal to the international community. Our
concern continues to be that our situation has not been fully
addressed and rectified until now. We welcome the new
willingness of the United States authorities to constructively
work with the Republic of the Marshall Islands to address
the full range of outstanding nuclear issues, which have for
so long affected our relationship and the well-being of our
people. We acknowledge the assistance that has been
provided up to now, which includes efforts at clean-up and
resettlement. But much more needs to be done.
We reiterate the call that was made to the High-level
Open-ended Working Group of the General Assembly on
the Financial Situation of the United Nations to reduce
the so-called floor rate in the scale of assessments. This
is an issue of vital importance to all developing countries
with small economies, in particular a large number of
small island developing States and least developed
countries. The situation was firmly noted by the
Committee on Contributions in its last report:
“the current floor assessment rate of 0.01 per cent
resulted in a serious departure from the principle of
capacity to pay for a number of smaller Member
States.” (A/50/11/Add.2, para. 50)
We call on the Fifth Committee to take action on
this matter as soon as possible, and the time for this has
come at this session of the General Assembly. In our
view, this would have a beneficial effect for over 60
countries.
Another area of reform that is of great concern to us
is the expansion of the Security Council. The need for a
more democratic process and for allowing greater
participation in the work of the Council is something that
we all reaffirmed during the fiftieth-anniversary session.
However, we have to make more progress in
implementing our ideas in this regard.
This will be a very important year for the United
Nations in that we will take stock of many of our current
activities and lay the groundwork for many others. As
Chair of the South Pacific Forum, the Republic of the
Marshall Islands will spare no effort to ensure a
successful conclusion to this year’s agenda. The Republic
of the Marshall Islands has been an active participant in
this Assembly in the five years that we have been a
member. We have come a long way since the adoption of
our Constitution in 1979. We pledge our cooperation to
the President’s leadership and we look forward to
working closely with him and the members of the General
Assembly.







"
1560,67,2012,PLW,"﻿This year’s general debate began
with a Declaration by world leaders that our collective
response to all challenges must be guided by the rule
of law (resolution 67/1). Palau is very proud to join in
that Declaration, as our national story is inextricably
linked with the international rule of law. Not long
ago, Palau emerged as the last United Nations Trust
Territory, granted independence after more than 100
years and four successive colonial administrations. Our
unique road to freedom left us with a lasting legacy: a
strong partnership with the United States of America
and a constitution that guarantees the Palauan people
the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
Through independence, we have preserved our
heritage, our culture and our environment. That
preservation was marked this year by UNESCO’s
designation of the Rock Islands of Palau as 2012’s only
natural and cultural world heritage site. And, just last
year, the United Nations Development Programme
ranked Palau forty-ninth in the world in its Human
Development Index, a composite measure of life
expectancy, health, educational attainment and living
standards. We are very proud of that ranking for this
small, new country. It is a tribute to Palau’s success.
Having gained so much, Palau has worked to give
back to the international community and to make the
world a better place. Palau proudly deployed officers as
peacekeepers in Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands,
and continues to do so today in Darfur.
Upon first taking its United Nations seat, Palau
focused its energies on the odious practice of deep-sea
bottom trawling. And though it has taken some time
and considerable buy-in from others, the two consensus
resolutions 61/105 and 66/68 show that we can help
protect vulnerable deep-sea marine ecosystems and
biodiversity on a global scale.

In 2009, from this rostrum, Palau’s President,
Johnson Toribiong, launched the first volley in an effort
to save the world’s dwindling shark populations. He
declared the world’s first shark sanctuary in his general
debate address. The ocean’s vitality depends on healthy
shark populations. So we are grateful that States and
territories from across the globe have joined Palau in
committing to nurture shark sanctuaries. Today, almost
2 million square miles of ocean — an area approximately
nine times the size of Palau’s waters — are safe for
sharks.
Palau was also the first to sound the alarm on the
security impacts of climate change. With our Pacific
brothers and sisters, we moved early on to declare
climate change a security issue that demands the special
attention of every organ of the United Nations system.
That was a new and different way of thinking about
the problem. Some sceptically questioned whether Blue
Helmets would be able to hold back the rising tides.
But 18 months after we began, the Assembly
adopted consensus resolution 63/281, inviting the
relevant organs of the United Nations to intensify
their efforts to consider and address climate change,
including its possible security implications. That call
was heeded by Germany, when it took up the issue last
July as President of the Security Council. Thanks to
Germany’s efforts, as well as those of others on the
Council, we now have a historic presidential statement
highlighting the potential risks of climate change to
international peace and security.
Germany’s statement and resolution 63/281 have
not stemmed the rising tides, but they have helped to
change the way we understand and discuss climate
change. No longer can anyone question the impact of
climate change on energy security, on food security, on
water security or indeed on our territorial integrity. No
longer can anyone deny that rising seas and oppressive
droughts are displacing people across the globe. As
the United States Permanent Representative said
at last year’s Council meeting, to deny the security
implications of climate change would be pathetic.
The world has reached a crossroads on sustainable
development. We have recently concluded discussions
at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development and will soon delineate new sustainable
development goals, focusing again on small island
developing States. For Palau, that crossroads is an
opportunity to better integrate healthy oceans and
fisheries into the regulatory development framework.
Sustainable fisheries are Palau’s lifeblood. For
Palau, it has always been, and continues to be, a blue
economy or no economy. That is why we have limited
purse seine fishing, agreed with our neighbours to
close the doughnut holes between our jurisdictions, and
implemented an innovative vessel day scheme strategy
through the parties to the Nauru Agreement. That is
also why we have conserved 58 per cent of our in-shore
marine area through the Protected Areas Network,
banned bottom trawling and declared the world’s first
shark sanctuary.
We were honoured this year that the Protected Areas
Network Act and the Shark Haven Act received the 2012
Future Policy Award for outstanding maritime policy
and for contributing most effectively to the sustainable
management of the world’s oceans and coasts for the
benefit of current and future generations. We thank the
World Future Council, the Convention on Biological
Diversity, the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, the Okeanos Foundation for the Sea
and the Global Environmental Facility for conferring
their generous recognition and support through that
award.
Palau champions three straightforward principles
for global fisheries. First, global fisheries should be
fair. If distant-water vessels want to come for fish that
traverse Palau’s waters, they should respect our laws.
They should fish within our limits and recognize our
right to realize the benefits of our natural resources.
Illegal fishing is tantamount to piracy; it robs us of our
livelihoods and undermines our security.
Secondly, global fisheries should be sustainable.
We should use every means at our disposal to achieve
stock levels that will ensure healthy fisheries for
the long term. That includes closing fisheries when
necessary.
Thirdly, global fisheries should be accountable.
Reports show that 87 per cent of global fish stocks
are now fully exploited or overexploited. Those are
the worst numbers on record. Regional fisheries
management organizations, which stand in the shoes of
the General Assembly, should do better and should be
more transparent. We are encouraged that negotiations
this year enabled the resolution on sustainable fisheries
(resolution 66/88) to better reflect those three principles.  Palau is pleased to report on the success of a number
of key domestic initiatives, which we have previously
raised in the general debate. Palau has taken innovative
steps to reduce our emissions by solarizing our airport,
our Government buildings and our highways. By
2020, we will generate 20 per cent of our energy from
renewable sources. We have also created a successful
green mortgage programme to assist the financing of
greener homes. That programme, which began with
a small amount of financing from Italy, was recently
the subject of a workshop among 13 regional financing
institutions, with plans for expansion throughout the
Pacific.
Palau is also working to connect itself to the
world — literally. It is inconceivable to many of us here
in New York, but Palau remains without broadband
Internet. That means that no Palauan can watch
the streaming video of this speech. The Broadband
Commission of the International Telecommunication
Union tells us that broadband access is a prerequisite
to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and
that a 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration
increases a developing country’s gross national product
by 1.4 per cent. We are sure that a 100 per cent increase
would fundamentally improve Palauan health, business
and civic engagement. We continue to seek partners
that might help Palau to reach that goal.
Last year Palau underwent its Human Rights
Council Universal Periodic Review. The most repeated
recommendation by Human Rights Council members
was that we should establish a national human rights
institution. With the help of new partners, we are
translating human rights conventions into Palauan,
bringing the lessons of international human rights into
Palauan schools, harmonizing our national legislation,
regulations and practices with the international human
rights instruments, and supporting human rights
programmes and services in Palau through that formal
institution.
All those activities have been complemented by
the outstanding work being done to remove explosive
remnants of Second World War from Palau. As President
Toribiong stated from this rostrum last year, many of
those explosives are still live and are being discovered
near our schools, roads and utilities. With the help of
our partners, much of this unexploded ordnance is being
destroyed. We hope that anyone interested in our efforts
will attend our upcoming regional workshop in October
to see first-hand the successful model of cooperation
between Palau’s Government, non-governmental
organizations, donors and the local community that is
eradicating that scourge from our midst.
We would like to express our gratitude for the
strong support and friendship of our partners for
helping to get those and other important projects off
the ground. Palau thanks especially the United States,
Japan, Australia and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
Palau continues to believe that Taiwan’s meaningful
participation in the United Nations system will help to
further promote the system’s efficacy, goals and ideals,
including those of the International Civil Aviation
Organization and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Palau very much appreciates the President’s
choice of “Bringing about adjustment or settlement
of international disputes or situations by peaceful
means” as the theme for this year’s general debate. It is
as important as ever that we commit to upholding the
peace and condemn violence wherever it occurs. To that
end, Palau condemns in the strongest possible terms the
recent attacks on the diplomatic premises in the Middle
East. We agree with President Obama that such attacks
are “an assault on the very ideals upon which the United
Nations was founded” (A/67/PV.6,  p.  11). We must be
vigilant in protecting all diplomatic missions, wherever
they may be.
Closer to our shores in the Pacific, Palau is also
hopeful that tensions in the East China Sea will
dissipate, and that all of our neighbours can engage in a
more peaceful dialogue.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon cautioned the
world last week that we are wilfully blind when it
comes to climate change. We are awash in reports
telling us that the situation is dire. We have experienced
more than 100 consecutive months of temperatures
above global averages. Nine of the 10 warmest years
on record have occurred since the year 2000. Arctic
sea ice is at its lowest level in recorded history. Coral
reefs are disappearing at an alarming rate. Now, buried
in the recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change regarding the management of risk is
advice to policymakers in small island States that, in
certain cases, they may wish to consider relocating their
populations. We assure the members of the Assembly
that Palau has no intention of moving its people. Our
islands are their home. They are the essence of Palau’s
very being. I can state with every confidence that Palau will pursue every legitimate recourse available before
we concede hope.
The current situation at the UNFCCC is
unacceptable. After more than 20 years of negotiations,
we are running out of creative ways to say that countries
are being destroyed. Sadly, it seems that the most
vulnerable countries have become acceptable collateral
damage. The world knows the causes of climate change.
It is within our grasp to effect a solution. No army
stands in our way. If something is not done soon, all
the good, hard work to which Palau and the other island
nations of the world have dedicated themselves will be
for naught.

In conclusion, we know that the times we live in
are turbulent, but we must heed our leaders’ call to be
guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the
international rule of law. Palau will continue to do
its part by being a moral voice for what is right, and
hopefully, a model global citizen."
1602,67,2012,AUS,"﻿You now preside, Sir, over
a forum for every voice — an Assembly of all people and
nations, one for no country or bloc to dominate solely
or lead as one alone, where small and medium-sized
countries are truly heard. Australia warmly welcomes
your election.
The story of the United Nations is truly global,
encompassing all the people of the world. It is a story of
the progress of small and medium-sized countries, not
just of great Powers. It is a story of reconstruction after
world war and of the resettlement of massing millions,
of navigating the winds of change and of the end of
colonialism, bringing self-determination to the world’s
great majority, the billions of the global South. It is
the story of harnessing new sources of wealth and new resources through a revolution of rising expectations
and during decades of dictatorship, famine and war. It
is the story of bringing to justice the perpetrators of
the worst international crimes and of preventing the
worst human atrocities. Now, extending freedom and
harnessing new markets, it is the story of lifting billions
more out of poverty and oppression. That has been the
work of the United Nations for seven decades.
This year we assemble in the knowledge born of
those years, neither expecting perfection nor accepting
the status quo. We understanding that there is much that
we can do together, and more that we can do together
than we could ever do alone.
The United Nations articulates humankind’s
highest ideals. Even more, it makes practical progress
towards realizing those ideals in the world. There
is no better example of that than the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) — specific, measurable
targets of the highest human importance that are now
familiar to us all. Twelve years after 2000 and three
years from 2015, the progress we have made must
be just as familiar. The global economy has grown.
Hundreds of millions of people have lifted themselves
up. That first fundamental Goal, to halve the proportion
of the world’s population living in extreme poverty, has
now been achieved: 1 billion human lives transformed.
A decade ago 100 million children did not get to go
to school. That number has been reduced by fully one
third, and 33 million human futures have been entirely
remade.
But we must all acknowledge that there are vital
areas where the international community is failing to
achieve change. That is why I accepted the Secretary-
General’s invitation to co-chair the Millennium
Development Goals Advocacy Group alongside
Rwanda: to advocate for practical progress in the
coming three years. Where the world has fallen short
of ambitious goals, our response must be action, not
disillusion. That is what Australia will do. We will act.
We will help improve education. Australia’s
development spending on education doubled in the
past five years. We will be among the world’s largest
education donors in 2015. I am especially pleased to join
as an education champion in support of the Secretary-
General’s Education First initiative to mobilize global
support to help achieve education for all children by
2015. I am honoured to lend it Australia’s support.

We will help increase gender equality. I am proud
to announce that at the Pacific Islands Forum Australia
said that it would work alongside our partners in the
Pacific on an unprecedented gender initiative: Pacific
Women Shaping Pacific Development. Australia will
provide $320 million over 10 years to support women’s
political participation, to expand women’s leadership
and to spread economic and social opportunities in
the Pacific. That is a principle underpinning every
Australian aid intervention and initiative: empowering
women and girls.
We will help fight drug-resistant malaria. The
Secretary-General has made malaria one of his key
priorities for his second term. It is a priority we share.
Since 2000, the world has cut the number of deaths
from malaria by 26 per cent. Without those advances,
330,000 more people would have died of malaria last
year, the great majority of them in Africa. But malaria
itself is fighting back. New drug resistance in malaria
must be overcome. Later this year, Australia will hold
the Malaria 2012 meeting, bringing together political
leaders, civil society and the private sector to accelerate
efforts to control and eliminate malaria and combat
growing drug resistance.
While we are working hard to realize the MDGs in
the next three years, Australia is looking further ahead.
The year 2015 is a goal, but it is not a destination. Rather,
it must be a new point of departure for much new work.
Australia pledges to contribute to the important work
of the high-level panel on the post-2015 development
agenda.
Australia brings considerable national experience
in working with conflict-affected States and least
developed countries, especially in our own region. We
will seek to apply what we have learned in our work since
2000 to the world’s plans for beyond 2015. First, peace
is an essential foundation to development, and building
peace is vital to the progress of societies recovering from
conflict. Peacekeepers today must be peacebuilders,
not just stopping conflict but enabling development.
Secondly, there can be no poverty alleviation without
the creation of wealth and jobs. Growth alone is never
sufficient; but to achieve development in the interests
of all people we must create jobs and wealth. Thirdly,
we cannot make poverty history unless we also consign
to history the argument that environmental protection
and human development are conflicting global goals.
Climate change threatens the security of the food supply that guarantees development. New, clean sources of
energy deliver a new source of economic growth.
Australia is one of the world’s most successful
multicultural and multi-faith nations. The Australian
experience proves a deeply important fact. There is
nothing natural or inevitable about violent conflict over
religious belief. We must reaffirm that again today.
The denigration of religious beliefs is never acceptable.
Australia seeks to be an example of freedom for all
faiths, and we support that in the wider world. However,
our tolerance must never extend to tolerating religious
hatred and incitement to violence. Whether such
attitudes lead to attacks against members of religious
minorities or diplomats or to attacks against houses of
worship or diplomatic missions, the perpetrators of all
such violence must be brought to justice and all such
incitement must be condemned. Australia condemns
violence and we work for peace.
We proudly do our full part in the work of the
United Nations for peace and security. We stringently
observe Security Council resolutions aimed at
curtailing weapons proliferation activities, like those
of North Korea. We take the leading role in the United
Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste. We lead
the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands,
which operates with the United Nation’s endorsement.
And we have been the largest non-NATO contributor
to the United Nations-mandated International Security
Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Australia will bring
that record of service to the international community
to our service on the Security Council, should we
have the privilege to be elected by the United Nations
membership in October. There and beyond, our work
and the work of every nation for peace must continue.
As we meet, the Syrian Government is turning
the instruments of State power against the very people
whom State power ought to protect, employing heavy
weapons and ground-attack aircraft against civilians
and engaging in systematic human rights abuses.
Syria’s neighbours — in particular Jordan, Turkey,
Lebanon and Iraq — are burdened by growing numbers
of refugees and are delivering vital help to desperate
people.
The United Nations has done important work
already. Australia is doing its part to help through
humanitarian aid. We must do everything we can to end
the suffering of the Syrian people and to rebuild Syrian
society. Those who are committing crimes against humanity must be held accountable. The international
community must unite behind Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,
the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations
and the League of Arab States for Syria. We urge the
members of the Security Council to do so and to act
decisively.
The international community must also unite in
guarding against the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. It is now six years since the Security
Council first expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear
weapons programme. Iran still refuses to take the urgent
steps necessary to build confidence that its nuclear
programme is exclusively peaceful. In contravention
of successive International Atomic Energy Agency and
Security Council resolutions, Iran is moving closer to
having the capacity to produce weapons-grade material.
We therefore stand with the world, united in
sending a strong signal, through Security Council
sanctions, that Iran must change its behaviour now. A
nuclear-armed Iran would be a major threat to regional
and global security, especially given the shocking and
aggressive statements about Israel by Iran’s leadership.
There remains the opportunity for diplomacy, backed
up by robust sanctions, to persuade Iran to change its
course. Iran must take this opportunity for change, and
the nations of the Assembly must press it to do so.
There must also be change in the Middle East peace
process. Australia shares the frustration of the parties
at the current impasse.
We understand the strong desire of the Palestinian
people for national self-determination. Australia
is resolutely committed to the establishment of a
Palestinian State that is both independent and viable.
That is why we provide significant support to the
foundations of a future Palestinian State and build its
infrastructure and economy. More than $300 million in
aid has been provided for the period from 2011 to 2016.
We commend the genuine progress President Abbas
and Prime Minister Fayyad have made in building
the institutions and infrastructure for statehood. And
no one can doubt Australia’s close and continuing
friendship with Israel. Our support for the right of
Israel and its people to exist in security and peace is a historic commitment in Australian policy, and it will
endure.
We urge a return to direct negotiations and that
those negotiations be between the two parties. That is
the only durable basis for achieving a two-State solution.
The present impasse must be overcome. Both sides
need to make compromises and avoid provocations. It
will take sacrifice on both sides to settle complex and
difficult issues such as settlements, borders, security
and Jerusalem. The Israeli and Palestinian people
deserve no less.
Australia’s ideals in the world are those of the
United Nations, and Australians know the practical
value of the United Nations work. That is why Australia
seeks to serve in all the work of the United Nations and
on the Security Council. We are a strong democracy,
welcoming all the peoples, languages and religions
of the world. We are a country of the Asia-Pacific, a
neighbour to developing countries, with a perspective
of both the North and South. We are a State with a
decades-long tradition of capable and committed work
in the United Nations. We contributed to the first
United Nations peacekeeping force in 1947, and we lead
contemporary peacebuilding in our own region.
We support the development of new norms to
enable the United Nations and its States Members to
act to prevent atrocities and to make the perpetrators of
the worst crimes accountable for them. We act as a first
responder to humanitarian need, as a donor who stays
the course and as a partner in rebuilding after conflict.
Australia embraces the high ideals of the United Nations
and takes a practical approach to achieving change. The
work of the United Nations is a historic task in which
Australia wholeheartedly joins."
1615,67,2012,NRU,"﻿Allow me to congratulate
Mr. Jeremić on his assumption of the presidency of the
General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and also
to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Nassir
Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for his effective leadership during
the sixty-sixth session. The President can be assured of
my delegation’s full support and cooperation during his
tenure.
This body was a very different place when Minister
Paul-Henri Spaak, another presidential predecessor,
opened the first session of the General Assembly. The
world had just emerged from the most devastating
carnage it had ever seen, and the United Nations
had the enormous task of stitching civilization back
together again. Finding common purpose among the
original 51 Member States promised to be a Herculean
effort — a similar endeavour had faltered only a decade
earlier — but the stakes were far too high for failure to
be an option. Accordingly, the Organization embarked
in earnest on the long process of strengthening the
rule of international law based on the principles of
non-aggression and the sovereign equality of all nations.
It is a testament to the success of those early
efforts that the membership of the United Nations has
swelled to 193 countries and the past 67 years have
been a period of relative stability. While the benefits
of multilateralism during this time were often shared
unequally, as were the costs, the promise of a more
stable and secure future for all imbued the United
Nations with the legitimacy it needed to pursue its
ambitious mandate. But we must never forget that the
legitimacy underpinning our essential work here is not
a birthright; we must earn it. When our words become
hollow, that legitimacy is threatened.
The work of our early predecessors was one of
construction. The task at hand today, perhaps even
more challenging, is one of restoration. We are awash in
unfulfilled promises stretching back decades. Barring
a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, multilateralism
has for the most part deteriorated into a scramble for
finite resources, a destructive fight for a bigger piece
of the economic pie, sugarcoated with empty rhetoric.
Look at the beginning of any international agreement
and you will find reaffirmation upon reaffirmation of
our non-binding commitments to live up to our lofty
ideals. Perhaps their greatest value is as a reminder of how often very little has been achieved. Our words
must have meaning if our multilateral institutions are
to remain effective in addressing emerging global
challenges. Once again, the stakes are too high for
failure to be an option.That dynamic could not be more
evident than it was in the climate change negotiations.
This summer, we were treated to a new round of truly
terrifying news. Arctic sea ice dropped to its lowest
extent in recorded history, shattering the previous
record by a jaw-dropping 18 per cent. Some scientists
are now predicting that the Arctic Ocean could be
ice-free during summer in as little as five years. The ice
melt is already wreaking significant havoc on weather
patterns around the globe and has probably contributed
to the historic heat waves that struck many places this
year.
Just last week, a new study found that half of all
coral reefs could be lost with a temperature rise above
1.2 degrees Celsius. The scientists further concluded:
“There is little doubt... coral reefs will no longer be
prominent within coastal ecosystems if global average
temperatures exceed 2 degrees Celsius...” That would
be devastating for the economies of small islands and
coastal communities around the world, not to mention
the staggering and irrevocable loss of biodiversity
that would be incurred by our shared natural heritage.
More and more studies are concluding that the door to
limiting temperature rise to even 2 degrees is rapidly
closing, if it has not closed already.
Meanwhile, greenhouse-gas emissions continue
to climb higher each year, with no end in sight. Small
islands may be the canary in the coal mine, but we all
are staring a global catastrophe right in the face.
It is revealing just how much our ambition to
address the crisis has been downscaled in just three
years. The fifteenth session of the Conference of the
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, held in Copenhagen, was the
conference to save the world. The United Nations
Climate Change Conference, held in Cancún, Mexico,
was the conference to save the process. The Conference
of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to
the Kyoto Protocol, held in Durban, South Africa, it
seems, was the conference to save the rest for later.
Instead of increasing the urgency of our work to
respond to the growing climate crisis, we have instead
seen the steady dismantling of the international
regime and a concerted effort to delay additional
action until 2020. Such an outcome is unacceptable. If
multilateralism is to have any credibility, then we must
move to an emergency footing, and those countries
with the greatest capacity must immediately begin
mobilizing the significant resources necessary to
remake the energy infrastructure that powers the global
economy. That must begin at the eighteenth session of
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change in Doha with the reprioritization of pre-2020
mitigation ambition and the mobilization of means
of implementation, including finance, technology and
capacity-building.
Nauru’s delegation will arrive in Doha prepared
to make its contribution to the global effort. We have
adopted a very ambitious renewable energy goal of
50 per cent by 2015. We think we can achieve it, but
we will need climate financing from international
sources to do so. As with most developing countries,
obtaining the means of implementation will be the key
to unlocking our ambition.
The ultimate objective of the Convention on Climate
Change is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level that
averts dangerous interference with the climate system so
that ecosystems can adapt naturally, food production is
not threatened and economic development can proceed
in a sustainable manner. We should stop pretending that
this is still within reach.
We must realize that we have polluted the
atmosphere so much that many dangerous climate
change impacts are now unavoidable. Therefore,
the United Nations system must begin analysing and
addressing the security implications of climate change.
Climate change will become an increasing driver
of conflict in the future if we do not take steps now.
Increased competition over dwindling natural resources,
food and water insecurity, and forced migration are
just a few of the security issues that climate change
is expected to exacerbate. For that reason, the Pacific
small island developing States (SIDS) have called for
the appointment of a special representative on climate
and security, supported by adequate resources, to
begin analysing the security threats of climate change
and to work with interested Member States to build
their resilience. In addition, the Secretary-General of
the United Nations should be requested to conduct an
assessment of the United Nations system’s capacity
to respond to the various security implications of
climate change. Member States, particularly the most
vulnerable, must have confidence that the international community has the tools and resources to respond to
the crisis.
Some countries have been sceptical of Security
Council involvement in climate change. That is
understandable because the Council’s current
composition does not accurately reflect the diversity
of United Nations membership. The time has come for
this to be remedied. However, reform should not be
limited merely to membership. The Council must also
provide a forum for addressing the security challenges
of all countries, not just those of concern to the most
powerful.
The United Nations sustainable development
initiatives have been graced with an abundance of
lofty rhetoric but few resources. Many countries,
including my own, are not on track to meet their
Millennium Development Goals, and in some cases
have suffered setbacks because of the recent global
economic downturn. At the same time, the f low of
official development assistance from some channels
has diminished, further jeopardizing our ability to
achieve our MDGs.
We often forget that oceans cover 70 per cent of
the Earth’s surface and that healthy marine ecosystems
are vital to the sustainable development and sustainable
livelihoods of small islands. For many of us, the only
valuable natural resource we have is our fish. It forms
the cornerstone of our efforts to eradicate poverty and
provide livelihoods for our people. For us, fishing is
not just another economic sector — it is often the only
significant economic sector, and we must jealously
guard our modest natural wealth so that it can provide
for many generations to come.
While the outcome document of the United Nations
Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio had
few concrete deliverables, it did capture the Pacific
SIDS vision of a blue economy. If fully implemented,
the new provisions could help stem the steep decline
in fish stocks. We welcome the recognition of ocean
acidification as an emergent threat, and we must work
collectively to build the resilience of marine ecosystems
to climate change impacts. The commitments made in
Rio must be backed by real resources so they can be
translated into concrete results on the ground.
Rio also infused new energy into making islands
a model for sustainable development by agreeing to
convene the third Global Conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island Developing States, which is to be held in the Pacific in 2014. The Conference will
provide an opportunity for the international community
to make good on the promises of the Barbados
Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for
Implementation by setting specific goals and mobilizing
real resources. We call on the international community
to provide support for the Conference and to summon
the political will necessary to make it a success. It was
agreed at the first Earth Summit that the sustainable
development of SIDS would be the first test of the
global partnership. We must demonstrate to the world
that this partnership means something.
A central aspect of that work must be enhancing
the international system to better target the unique
combination of challenges faced by SIDS, which
should include the creation of a formal SIDS category
at the United Nations. It is clear from 20 years of
experience that the current arrangements for improving
the sustainabIe development prospects of SIDS are
ineffective. We must demonstrate that the multilateral
system is nimble enough to evolve in response to the
shortcomings that have been identified.
Nauru welcomes the attention that the theme of
this year’s general debate brings to the need to address
disputes by peaceful means, and it commends the
efforts made by Taiwan and China to reduce tensions
and increase cooperation. I call on Member States to
support continuing dialogue between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait and the parties concerned in the East
China Sea dispute to recognize Taiwan’s positive role
in consolidating peace and stability in East Asia. Nauru
urges a rapid and peaceful settlement of the situation
in South Ossetia and Abkhazia in a manner that treats
those affected with dignity and that respects their rights
as a sovereign nation.
Nauru continues to support the right of Israel to live
free from the fear of terrorism. We also acknowledge
Palestine’s right to statehood as part of a two-State
solution, which can be achieved only through peaceful
means.
The challenges facing the international community
are great and can be solved only by concerted
multilateral action. President Jeremić’s task and ours
is to begin the process of rebuilding the Organization.
That process must restore the integrity of the institution
entrusted with the protection of human dignity. It
was accomplished once before in the aftermath of a
catastrophe. This time, our goal must be to prevent one.
I pledge Nauru’s full support in that endeavour."
1647,67,2012,NZL,"﻿I bring greetings
from the South Pacific. For the past year, New Zealand
has had the privilege of chairing the Pacific Islands
Forum, a regional body that represents some of the
smallest and most vulnerable States on this planet. For
us that has been an important responsibility.
Because we are a small country with modest
resources, we choose to focus much of our attention
on our own region. Over 60 per cent of our official
development assistance is spent in our own
neighbourhood. Serving as Chair of the Pacific Islands
Forum has caused us to reflect on the role of regional
organizations, and also on the extent to which we all
depend on the United Nations for solutions to challenges
that are truly global in character. I say with some
confidence that we have been making good progress
in dealing with those challenges that are capable of
regional solutions.
But I must also say that we need and expect more
from this institution. The Pacific Islands Forum has
16 members, of which 16 are small island States. I was
pleased this week to attend the first meeting between
the Secretary-General and Pacific Islands Forum
leaders, which I hope will mark a new era of enhanced
high-level engagement between this Organization and
our region and a greater understanding of our needs.
The Pacific has had its share of stability and
security challenges in recent times. As a region, we
have done reasonably well in dealing with them. Most recently it has been in Solomon Islands that a regional
initiative has been required. The Regional Assistance
Mission to the Solomon Islands has involved a truly
regional approach, with the participation of police
and other personnel from every member of the Pacific
Islands Forum. I am pleased to report that the security
element of that initiative has been significantly scaled
down and will soon be fully withdrawn. But there is
also more that this Organization, particularly the
Security Council, can do to acknowledge and support
regional leadership on peace and security matters in the
Pacific and elsewhere.
Concerns about democracy, the rule of law and
human rights are not mere abstract considerations within
the Pacific. Those principles have been challenged in a
number of States, most notably, in recent years, in Fiji.
In that respect, I am pleased to report that progress is
being made towards the holding of elections in 2014,
and that support has been forthcoming to ensure that
such elections are free and fair.
Stability and security issues are not the only
priorities for our regional body. In our year as Forum
Chair, New Zealand chose to focus on a number of
development priorities, two of which I wish to mention
in my remarks today.
For many of the poorer States within our region,
their fisheries resource is the major economic asset they
hold. Yet due to illegal fishing practices, unreported
catch and inadequate management practices, those
countries have received far too small a return on that
resource. Because of the highly migratory character
of the tuna resource, this is truly a matter requiring
regional management. Solid progress is being made
in such areas as improved surveillance, the training
of monitors and improved management practices, both
to protect the last really healthy fishery on the planet
and to ensure that its owners receive a fair share of the
resource they own.
One of the highest priorities within our region
is the need for practical initiatives in the area of
renewable energy. Ours is a region heavily dependent
upon fossil fuels for the generation of electricity. The
cost of expensive imported diesel in most small Pacific
economies is absolutely crippling. The climate change
impact is obvious.
After a decade of climate change conferences and
hundreds of millions of dollars in so-called climate
change initiatives, one might be forgiven for imagining that the Pacific, overendowed as it is with good sunlight,
would by now be positively festooned with solar power
plants. Sadly, I must report that that is not in fact the
case. Indeed, one of the most striking features of our
region has been the complete lack of progress in putting
lofty climate change rhetoric into any form of renewable
energy practice.
In our year in the Chair of the regional body we
have set out to correct that serious shortcoming. A
small but important illustration lies in our work in
the tiny Tokelau Islands. Until now, Tokelau has been
100 per cent dependent on fossil fuels for the generation
of electricity. By the end 2012, Tokelau will be over
90 per cent resourced with renewable solar electricity.
Good progress has also been made in Tonga, where
I recently participated in the opening of a solar power
plant supplying around 20 per cent of the electricity
requirements of the main island, Tongatapu. And we
are working with the Cook Islands Government, too,
to assist in meeting their bold aspiration to 50 per cent
renewable electricity by 2015, mostly through solar
initiatives.
These New Zealand-funded programmes are
an important part of our overall commitment to our
region. Our parting legacy from our year as Chair
of the regional body is a renewable-energy pledging
conference to be held early next year, with the objective
of matching donors, suppliers of concessional and
commercial finance, and others with the renewable
energy plans of our Pacific neighbours. Here I should
acknowledge the European Union’s commitment in
co-leading this initiative, as well as the support of the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the
Governments of Australia, the United States and other
generous supporters.
While there is much that can be achieved by
regional action, we must acknowledge that sometimes
regional solutions are just not enough. That goes right
to the very heart of the reason for the existence of this
Organization. My point is most vividly illustrated
today in relation to Syria. It would be difficult for
me to overstate the level of frustration of the people
I represent with the complete inability of the Security
Council to act in relation to Syria. And it would be
even more difficult to overstate the extent to which the
Security Council is at risk of losing its credibility in the
eyes of reasonable and fair-minded people through its
inability to act. People in my country ask a very simple question:
If 25,000 deaths, countless thousands injured and
many more displaced and homeless are not enough to
get the Security Council to act, then what does it take?
Just what does it take? I welcome the leadership that
the Arab League and Arab States have shown on this
issue, and we have seen similar leadership from them
on other difficult issues in their region. And I welcome
the fact that the General Assembly has been looking
for opportunities to be more engaged. In the absence of
leadership from the Security Council, 1 suggest that the
Assembly must find ways to play a more activist role.
But from all of this, the case for Security Council
reform has become utterly compelling. Indeed,
increasingly, the future credibility of the United
Nations may depend on it. If we are to make progress
in this area we will need to see Members move past the
extravagant attempts to maximize individual positions
and try to find some meaningful, practical reforms that
actually hold the prospect of widespread support.
I represent a small nation of practical, constructive
people. And it is because we seek practical,
constructive reform that our Government supports the
so-called intermediate solution: the creation of a new
category of seat for the group of larger countries that
feel underrepresented in comparison with the five
permanent members of the Security Council (P-5), but
seats that they would have to win in open elections
so as to make them fully accountable to the broader
membership.
I do not intend in these remarks to discuss any other
specific proposals we would like to see considered, with
one exception. There are now compelling reasons for us
to ask the P-5 to voluntarily accept restrictions on the
use of the veto. To go further and to seek its abolition is
pointless; it simply will not happen. But to ask the P-5
to acknowledge and respect the genuine concerns of the
wider membership by voluntarily accepting a curb on
the exercise of the veto is an entirely reasonable and
achievable objective.
My country was one of those that led the opposition
to the veto when the Organization was being established;
indeed, it was the only Charter issue that was forced to a
vote. The permanent members argued at that stage that
the veto was necessary in order to protect their vital
national interests. Yet today we routinely see the veto
exercised in circumstances that have little to do with
national interests. My request to the five permanent members is simply that they stick with what they said
to us back in 1945. And my challenge to them today
is to consider a process by which they collectively and
voluntarily agree to confine their use of the veto to
those issues that clearly and directly affect their vital
national interests; and also that they voluntarily agree
not to use their veto in situations that involve mass
atrocities.
While on the topic of the Security Council, I
would like to take the opportunity to urge the Council
and the relevant organs of the General Assembly to
respond positively to the requests from the Economic
Community of West African States for support in
dealing with the conflict in Mali and the Sahel. Too
often we have seen the Council fail to respond in
a timely way to requests for help — in Rwanda, in
Guinea, in Darfur and in Somalia. Too often it has been
a case of too little, too late. In all of these cases we have
seen good leadership from within the African Union,
and that leadership deserves a timely and constructive
response from New York.
Many of those here will be aware that New Zealand
is an energetic candidate for election to the Security
Council for the term from 2015-2016. I can assure the
Assembly that it will hear more from us on these topics
over the next two years. We are a small country with
a big voice and an approach that is fair-minded and
constructive.
In the past few days. the Assembly has heard from
both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.
We are now on notice that the issue of Palestinian status
in the United Nations will come before the Assembly
during this session. We look forward to seeing the text
of a draft resolution and to engaging in the consultations
that have been signaled to us. I said earlier that New
Zealanders are practical and constructive. They are also
fair-minded people; they expect to see their Government
bring all of those attributes to the consideration of such
a resolution, and that we will surely do. Having said
that, let me also be clear that we see such a resolution
as a very poor substitute for the direct discussions that
should occur between two leaders who live half an hour
down the road from each other.
In his address to the Assembly earlier in the week
(see A/67/PV.12), Prime Minister Netanyahu set out
clearly the grave implications for the Middle East, and
for the global community more generally, of a nuclear
breakout in the region. Like other Member States, New Zealand believes Iran must be told to step back from
a course that risks further dangerous escalation of the
situation. We hope the international community will
stand firm in sending that sort of message. In return,
however, I suggest that it is fair for the international
community to make a request of Prime Minister
Netanyahu. And that is to put the settlements on hold, at
the very least while negotiations proceed, and to engage
in the direct talks with his Palestinian counterpart that
represent the only basis for a durable solution to this
issue, and an essential step in removing the seeds of
wider conflict within the region.
I would like to remind the Assembly that these are
very difficult times for Governments around the world.
Budget economies have affected foreign ministries,
my own included. It is only fair that we should in
turn ask this large institution to find economies and
improve working methods in order to deliver better
value for our taxpayers. Smaller countries, like New
Zealand, depend more than most on good multilateral
institutions. We need a United Nations that is modern,
efficient and able to meet changing needs. We all need
a Security Council that is more responsive to the needs
of the wider membership and more effective in dealing
with the significant challenges that we all confront
today."
1651,67,2012,VUT,"﻿Vanuatu wishes to
associate itself with other delegations in congratulating
the President and the members of his Bureau on their
election to lead us through this sixty-seventh session
of the General Assembly. I am indeed profoundly
delighted, as Mr. Jeremić assured us in our meeting
earlier this week, that he will do his utmost to assist
with and bring to the forefront the issues that confront
the Pacific island States and other marginalized
nations. We trust that with his guidance, this session
will conclude with successful outcomes.
Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,
Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who, with strong
leadership and diplomatic finesse, led us to great
outcomes during the sixty-sixth session of the Assembly.
Our world has seen unprecedented disputes and
conflicts, most of which have spanned successive generations. The theme of the sixty-seventh session,
“Bringing about adjustment or settlement of
international disputes or situations by peaceful means”,
should therefore lead us to focus on finding lasting
solutions to the numerous ongoing conflicts in various
parts of the world that are causing vulnerable people to
suffer. Members have the solemn responsibility to steer
this multilateral gathering towards deeper consideration
of the founding goals of the Organization, which are
to encourage and create a more secure and peaceful
world in which diverse cultures and civilizations can
coexist without having to resort to force and violence
to achieve their goals.
This rostrum can testify to all the speeches that
have been delivered by the world’s great leaders on a
vast array of issues that affect humankind. Many of us
representing politically independent nations here have
shared the journey and the litany of heartaches and
dreams deferred of many of our global citizens, whose
human rights to larger political and civil freedom are
still bound by the tentacles of imperialism and the
legacy of colonialism. Even now, for the remaining
colonized territories, this rostrum represents the
pinnacle they so greatly aspire to reach one day.
Since 1980, the Republic of Vanuatu has repeatedly
called for the United Nations to strengthen its efforts
towards achieving the full decolonization of territories
still controlled by administrative Powers. I call on the
independent, free nations of the world to complete the
story of decolonization and to close that chapter.
At this juncture, I urge the United Nations not
to reject the demands for French Polynesia’s right to
self-determination and progress. In the same manner,
negotiations for the self-government of the indigenous
people of New Caledonia must continue. We encourage
the parties to ensure that the process towards achieving
self-government will stay on track.
I also call upon Members to ensure that collective
action is taken to lift the embargo on Cuba. We, the
Members of the United Nations, must revive our
political motivation and courage, dispel our feelings of
animosity, and ensure that United Nations resolutions
on that issue are fully implemented. Our actions must
not detract from the universal values of love and respect
for people, no matter how insignificant they may be to
the powerful nations. I hope that one day we will at last
be able to echo the message of freedom to many of our
friends who still suffer from the burden of conflicting
ideologies.

Last year, I reiterated to this Assembly our serious
concerns over the denial of a country’s right to exercise
its full political freedom and inherent cultural rights
over its maritime territories. Since we gained our
independence 32 years ago, our territorial dispute with
the French Republic over the southern two islands of
Vanuatu, Matthew and Hunter, has been a reminder
that we must continue to uphold the notion that the rule
of law should not be used by powerful nations as an
instrument to coerce weak and small nations, especially
in territorial disputes.
The French and the Vanuatu Governments met in
Paris in April to commence dialogue on the issue of the
territorially disputed islands. We take this opportunity
to thank the French Government for finally opening its
door to dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to resolve
that outstanding international dispute. We acknowledge
the procedures outlined within the United Nations to
ensure that such disputes are amicably resolved.
As a small island State surrounded by the vast
Pacific Ocean, Vanuatu is exposed to the notorious
illegal transshipment of and trade in illicit arms. The
international arms trade has continuously lacked proper
and coherent regulation and is responsible for the loss of
innumerable lives. Like many other countries, we call
on the United Nations to take a much firmer approach
in expediting the conclusion of an arms trade treaty,
which would provide greater security and control over
such illegal activity. That is an issue of paramount
importance to all countries exposed to the illegal trade
in arms and light weapons.
My country has consistently argued that the
mechanisms and criteria for assessing graduation
eligibility must not be isolated from the permanent and
inherent vulnerabilities of our countries. It is unrealistic
for United Nations agencies to assess progress and
make projections without taking into consideration the
matter of permanent vulnerabilities and the capacity
to sustain growth in our countries after graduation. I
wish to further state that, according to the World Risk
Report 2011, Vanuatu scored highest on the World Risk
Index as the country with the greatest disaster risk, due
to its high exposure and weak coping capacities. The
findings of that report are critical, and we therefore ask
that the United Nations Committee for Development
Policy carefully weigh its arguments and reassess the
vulnerability graduation criteria.
I would also like to state that, prior to another
triennial review of the least developed country (LDC) category, the United Nations will need to ensure that
proper resolutions are adopted by the General Assembly
to ensure that small island States graduating from LDC
status continue to enjoy certain preferential treatment,
even after graduation, to offset the vulnerability factor.
Let me take this opportunity to invite the members of
the triennial review to visit my country to establish
first-hand information and ascertain the findings of
the World Risk Report prior to escalating the process of
graduation in 2013.
Our own experience has shown that the different
ways that multilateral organizations and institutions
categorize member countries can affect the f low of
development assistance. For instance, Vanuatu, together
with 15 other countries, was selected several years ago
from among the Pacific island countries to benefit from
the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funding
of the Government of the United States of America. At
the time of our selection, Vanuatu was graded as a low-
income country and, by the eligibility criteria of the
MCC, was automatically qualified for and benefited
from $66 million to build two major national roads on
two different islands in the country. I wish to express
our appreciation to the United States Government for
its assistance.
However, when the Report on Countries that are
Candidates for Millennium Challenge Corporation
Account Eligibility for Fiscal Year 2010 was released,
Vanuatu failed to qualify. The reason was simply that
the MCC was using World Bank criteria and graduated
Vanuatu from the status of low-income country to that
of low-middle-income country. In other words, the
World Bank’s criteria may be totally different from the
LDC criteria defined by the United Nations. I therefore
wish to call on the United Nations, especially the
Economic and Social Council, to ensure that the LDC
definition and criteria used by United Nations agencies
are compatible with those of the international financial
institutions.
The vast Pacific Ocean is our heritage and the
prime means of livelihood of the people living in its
island countries. Like other Pacific Island countries,
Vanuatu continues to be exposed to and threatened by
the negative impacts of climate change, such as coastal
erosion, coral bleaching and ocean acidification. At the
Forty-Third Pacific Islands Forum in the Cook Islands,
the Forum leaders noted that many challenges remain in
realizing benefits from the pledged new and additional
targets of the Copenhagen Accord. In that respect, I would like to seize this opportunity to express our wish
for United Nations assistance in facilitating effective
responses to global climate change, particularly through
the prompt implementation of adaptation measures, as
well as mitigation efforts, climate change financing,
capacity-building and international negotiations.
While we tend to direct our main focus of attention
towards global climate change, we must address other
matters, such as environmental pollution, with the
same exigency and rigor. The potential for permanent,
irrevocable damage to the environment by marine
pollution has been constantly highlighted by the
scientific community and should not be tolerated.
The future growth of international maritime traffic
will further exacerbate the situation. Vanuatu urges
all remaining States that have not yet done so to
expeditiously sign and ratify the 1972 London
Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, as well as the
1996 Protocol thereto, and to promulgate and enforce
legal regimes, both in the domestic and international
arenas.
At this point, I would like to reiterate the
unnecessary risk to which we expose our children and
ourselves by not taking a firm precautionary approach
with regard to marine geoengineering practices,
such as sub-seabed carbon sequestration and ocean
fertilization. In our global efforts to combat climate
change, the strict promotion of and adherence to only
those responses that are environmentally sensible is
our crucial responsibility, and I am not only speaking
on behalf of a small island nation when I recall that,
by forgetting the essentiality of the oceans as the
very foundation of life on Earth, one neglects a vital
guarantor of mankind’s future survival.
As I conclude this speech, I have to make a last
appeal to all assembled leaders. I urge them to take
immediate action upon their return to their home
countries to initiate the change that needs to come about
if we wish to preserve a planet capable of providing our
sons and daughters with a bright future. If the leaders
of the industrialized countries want to achieve the
proposed 1.5° C target, they have less than eight years
left to close a vast mitigation gap. Who if not they can
or will implement the required measures for that crucial
change? This may well be their last chance. In their
hands lie the hope and destiny of the world’s nations.
It is a responsibility that they must assume not only for
their own people, but for humankind as a whole. I am grateful for the opportunity to express my
views in this forum. Long live our aspirations to create
a better and a more secure world for everyone, and may
God bless the United Nations."
1682,67,2012,MHL,"﻿I bring the Assembly the warm
greeting of “Yokwe” from the Marshall Islands.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands was born first
in the hearts and minds of the Marshallese people, but
we also forged our nationhood under the auspices of the
United Nations f lag. The United Nations is truly our
second home. Our unique story, from United Nations
Trust Territory to Member State, deserves ref lection
by the international community, two decades after we
were welcomed as a United Nations Member.
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will
be reviewed in three years’ time. The Marshall Islands
is now firmly committed to making stronger progress,
especially with regard to achieving full access to
adequate education and decent employment and to
ensuring a sustainable environment. The MDGs are
not distant figures or statistics. The MDGs are in the
faces of our Marshallese children; the MDGs are in our
classrooms and hospitals. One of the most immediate
and necessary steps is to better integrate our bilateral
and regional development pathways with the MDGs, to
ensure that all efforts move in the same direction and
towards the same common goals.
As the Asia-Pacific region rises in the global
spotlight, so also must the Marshall Islands. Our
national future is still within our grasp, and our future
need not be so difficult if we and our partners undertake
the hard actions needed to change it.
Today, the Marshall Islands commits to being a key
success story in the Pacific. We will move with specific
actions to make firm and measurable progress towards
the MDGs and towards economic independence resting
on an expanded private sector, especially in regard to
our primary drivers of fisheries and tourism. We simply
have no other alternative but to rewrite our future.
We look to the future with targets in mind instead of
generalities. I have asked my Government for specific,
quantifiable development goals. I have also asked my
Government to list the necessary actions, to be taken by
ourselves and by our partners, needed to achieve them.
Today I am encouraging bilateral partners, especially
our closest partners, as well as the Secretary-General and the Pacific Islands Forum and its regional agencies,
to respond. Next year I hope to present the Assembly
with a report not about our plight but about our progress.
It is easy, and indeed rightful, to place blame on
the international community, especially concerning
climate change and fisheries, spheres where the open
political assurances of our partners too often fall victim
to their own self-interest once the negotiating doors
close. Yet the ultimate burden for achieving greater
national success must be on the Marshall Islands
Government and the Marshallese people. However
unfair multilateral outcomes may be to the smallest
nations, we must and will do whatever is in our national
power to assure a viable future. Nothing will stand in
our way.
The Marshall Islands is far from alone. Many
nations in the Pacific islands region share similar
challenges. Our collective Pacific progress must be a
key pillar of the 2014 global conference on small island
developing States, to be held in the Pacific. The next
summit of the Pacific Islands Forum will be held next
year in the Marshall Islands, and this meeting will
reveal firm and dramatic progress not only towards
basic social and environment goals, but also how a very
real expansion of public-private partnership will be
jump-started in the Pacific.
Since 1954, Marshallese leaders have visited the
United Nations to address the ongoing impact of the 67
nuclear tests conducted on our lands during our status
as a United Nations Trust Territory. That is our first
foreign policy issue, and it is more than a historical
legacy. It is a contemporary reality for our local
communities. The United Nations authorized many of
those tests through two resolutions, in 1954 and 1956,
which also made assurances of our basic human rights
and our full and safe return to our land, while today too
many Marshallese remain nuclear nomads, still unable
to safely resettle. While I acknowledge the important
efforts taken to date, the half-life of radioactive material
remains for generations, and much more needs to be
done.
But today, for the first time since the trusteeship
resolution of 1956, the United Nations has finally spoken.
Earlier this month, Mr. Calin Georgescu, Special
Rapporteur on human rights and toxic wastes, presented
his report regarding the nuclear testing programme
in the Marshall Islands (A/HRC/21/48/Add.1) to
the Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Special Rapporteur has presented significant findings that
indicate that the pain, mistrust, progress and failures
of the Marshallese people over decades have a human
rights dimension and that the international community
must respond with more than silence. The Marshallese
people have paid too heavy a price for the only instance
in which the United Nations explicitly authorized the
use of nuclear weapons.
I urge all relevant actors — the United States and
the wider international community and its agencies — to
join with the Marshall Islands and the Pacific Islands
Forum members in welcoming the Special Rapporteur’s
specific recommendations as a way forward to ensure
progress on regaining the very human rights that
should never have been lost. The Special Rapporteur’s
report must not be allowed to only collect dust on the
shelf; it should instead be a foundation for new efforts,
particularly with key international agencies. We have
no more time for well-worn accusations. The Marshall
Islands must not fail to advance the human rights of its
own citizens. Where old solutions have not worked, we
must not fail to find new ones.
We are not only a small island State, but truly a
large-ocean nation. Our sustainable fisheries represent
a primary pathway to the very economic strength
and social development I have just called for today.
Yet our aspirations are too often undermined by the
narrow commercial self-interests of those nations at the
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission that
might otherwise seek to embrace us as close political
partners. For us, our collective Pacific development is
not an isolated issue bound in technical jargon. It is the
very hope and economic survival of our entire nation,
and indeed the whole Pacific region. We realize only a
penny of true benefit for every dollar of fishing activity,
and despite scientific warnings, pressure on key fish
stocks has only increased, not diminished. Decades of
global lip service at the United Nations to sustainable
development seems to be lost on some of our fishing
partners.
The parties to the Nauru Agreement have become
a watershed political movement, recently achieving
certification of a sustainable fishery by the Marine
Stewardship Council, which is perhaps the largest such
fishery in the world. In the Pacific, we are already
deep into advancing the very sustainable development
measures agreed to at the United Nations Conference on
Sustainable Development (Rio+20), and we are growing
our own Pacific-driven commercial brand. It remains to be seen if key distant-water fishing nations will
continue to join us in forging a landmark sustainable
fishery or if they will choose to be left on the sidelines.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands is among
the low-lying nations in the world, and sea-level-rise
projections of more than a metre pose complex risks to
our future statehood, risks that we are only beginning
to unpack and address. Last year’s watershed agreement
on the Durban Platform, prepared at the 2011 United
Nations Climate Change Conference, has moved the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) into a new chapter of a single,
legally binding protocol applying to all nations by 2020.
It has also redoubled urgent efforts needed to close the
global mitigation gap. The time for endless North-
South division is now over, and the all-too-predictable
finger-pointing must end.
But the world can no longer wait for negotiators.
We must do more than pat ourselves on the back if
we are serious about reducing the risks to our future.
More action is needed by all nations and all actors in
all possible settings and negotiation forums. As the
Marshall Islands, we have a national energy plan and
UNFCCC target to cut our own emissions, boost our
efficiency and pursue new technology, such as ocean
thermal energy conversion, which can make us a
carbon-negative nation. I ask the rest of the world, will
it also meet us in increasing that ambition? Will it come
soon enough?
Climate adaptation poses perhaps the most complex
challenges for a low-lying nation, but we must overcome
them nonetheless. We cannot rely only on an uncertain
architecture of global climate finance to address the
very critical adaptation efforts that will be necessary
for our continued survival. In the large scale — up to
$100 billion a year — of the future Green Climate Fund
and other efforts, our relatively modest needs can easily
be overlooked. Our increasingly urgent needs on the
ground can no longer be met with paper studies and
disconnected pilot projects. Yet the Marshall Islands is
at present heavily reliant on international assistance. We
have little other means to provide for adaptation. The
growing belief, however wrong, that we must finance
some of our own adaptation efforts is perhaps the most
compelling reason to rapidly expand our private sector.
We must also create financial security through the debt
for adaptation swap being pursued by the Marshall
Islands and other small island nations. The United Nations cannot fail the needs of the most
vulnerable nations and must better harness the efforts
of all necessary actors. The Marshall Islands urges
other nations to facilitate the meaningful participation
of Taiwan within the United Nations system and the
international community. Taiwan should be able to
participate as an observer in the UNFCCC and the
International Civil Aviation Organization, as it does
in the World Health Assembly, and its potential for
meeting the MDGs should be recognized.
The international community must not fail to act,
not only to address long-term threats, but also to ease
the most immediate security concerns. Recent tension
in the broader Pacific Rim is an important matter for
the Pacific Islands region, which can grow only when
there is security and stability. I urge that those issues,
including that of the East China Sea, be peacefully
addressed through an inclusive dialogue involving all
key actors.
The smallest nations in the world, many of which
are in the Pacific, are beginning to play important and
unique roles on the international stage. But nations
such as the Marshall Islands also depend greatly on
firm multilateral action. Accordingly, they must be able
to rely on the United Nations and its Members for more
than symbolism. It is decisive and bold leadership that
are so urgently needed in this international hour."
1685,67,2012,PNG,"﻿Papua New Guinea
congratulates Mr. Jeremić on his recent election as
President of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh
session. Our country pledges its support to him in that
role. I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency
Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, for the valuable work
that he has done in the past year.
Papua New Guinea recently celebrated its 37
years of independence, on 16 September. Prior to that,
despite various challenges, our country successfully
completed its general elections in a fair and peaceful
manner. Those elections culminated in the convening
of our ninth National Parliament and the formation
of a new Government. We thank our close friends
and development partners that have assisted us in the
election process, including Australia, New Zealand,
Japan, South Korea, China, the United States, Great
Britain, the European Union, the United Nations and
the Commonwealth.
As a young developing nation, we are proud of our
Constitution-based and evolving democracy. While our
people have subsisted on the island nation of Papua New
Guinea for many centuries, our short modern history
continues to be a testament to the will of our people to
maintain and consolidate our burgeoning democracy in
line with the rule of law. In today’s world, that is the
basis on which a just and fair society is built and on
which societies have been built.
Papua New Guinea’s key development priorities in
the next five years are contained in our Medium-Term
Development Plan 2011-2015. That seeks to achieve a long-term national road map under our Vision 2050.
We need to strengthen our economy for it to be more
resilient to global market shocks by diversifying
trade and investment and by reviewing development
cooperation, ensuring that our people’s basic needs are
met.
Papua New Guinea is also increasing investment
in our children’s future, security and success by the
provision of free and quality education from the
elementary to the secondary level and by further
subsidizing education from Grade 12 to the tertiary
level. We believe that that will help us to achieve
Millennium Development Goal 2 on universal primary
education, which will enhance our nation-building
process.
We are also rehabilitating and developing our major
infrastructure, such as roads, airports, ports, schools
and hospitals, as key drivers of sustainable development
in our country. We are increasing support for funding
to ensure the delivery of basic health-care and social
services countrywide. That includes the revitalization
of our institutional and human resources capacity to
take the country to a higher development level, which
is our national development priority.
Our Government has prioritized combating
corruption at all levels of society. In doing so, we have
adopted the principle of zero tolerance. In that respect,
our country is setting up the Independent Commission
against Corruption to enhance implementation of the
United Nations Convention against Corruption. We
believe that such legislation and policy efforts will
improve good governance, resulting in the effective
delivery of basic services and the provision of access to
opportunities for participation in national development
by all relevant stakeholders.
The economy of Papua New Guinea is growing at
an annual rate of 8 per cent. Our improved economic
performance is underscored by political stability, sound
macroeconomic management and the development of
the first large liquefied natural gas project. The revenue
from that project is likely to increase the growth of our
economy, doubling the revenue base by 2014. We intend
to share that wealth with our Pacific neighbours in the
appropriate manner. In that context, a sovereign wealth
fund has been set up to professionally manage the
revenue from the liquefied natural gas project and other
extractive industries. We plan to reinvest that revenue
for the future of our country.

We believe that a strengthened economy will
improve our social indicators, particularly by
addressing our literacy levels, high maternal and infant
mortality rates, law and order enforcement, the ageing
public sector workforce and the declining state of our
country’s infrastructure.
Papua New Guinea supports the Secretary-
General’s five-year action agenda on sustainable
development, enhanced human security, enhancing the
core values of the international community, supporting
nations in transition, and working with and for women
and young people, which was launched on 25 January.
Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a strong
United Nations presence, through which various
development programmes have been implemented. We
highly value the contribution of the United Nations in
that regard.
We have also been implementing the One United
Nations initiative since 2006 as a self-starter country.
So far, that is working exceptionally well for our
country. We are also grateful that the United Nations
has heeded our call and has synergized its development
assistance framework 2012-2015 with our Medium-
Term Development Plan. However, we can do more. We
urge donor partners to abide by the principles of the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra
Agenda for Action. Through the Pacific Islands Forum,
we have adapted the Cairns Compact in order to better
coordinate development assistance and to ensure the
effective delivery of aid.
We welcome the proactive engagement of the United
Nations with the Pacific region and thank the Secretary-
General for his visit and ongoing commitment. We
are encouraged by that and by the fact that contacts
with the United Nations system and personnel will be
strengthened in the Pacific Islands region.
The challenge for Papua New Guinea is to ensure that
the development of our natural resources is sustainable
and that the benefits are effectively translated into the
improved livelihoods of our people. That, in turn, will
assist us in meeting our Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), especially the 22 indicators and 90 national
targets that we have set ourselves. We acknowledge
that it will be a challenge to attain all the MDGs by
2015, but note there has been measured progress in
the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, which
is MDG 1, and the reduction of child mortality, which is MDG 4. So for our part, our country is taking full
ownership of the MDGs.
With the support of our development partners such
as the European Union and the United Nations, Papua
New Guinea is conducting a trial of the Millennium
Village concept this month. We recommit ourselves
to working with our international partners, including
the United Nations, and we reiterate that the MDGs
need to be the priority while we discuss sustainable
development goals for the long term.
Papua New Guinea continues to scale up its
efforts to further strengthen human rights protection
and advancement in the country. We are working
closely with United Nations agencies and our other
development partners in the furtherance of these
objectives. To date, we have reported to the Human
Rights Council on work done relating to the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women in July 2010. We have also reported to
the Human Rights Council under the universal periodic
review process. Additionally, the 2012 report of the
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its
causes and consequences (A/HRC/20/16) and the 2010
report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
are being considered by our Government this year.
Papua New Guinea is committed to gender
empowerment and equality. We recognize women and
girls as not only key national development partners
but also persons whose inherent human dignity must
be respected and safeguarded. This is a central pillar
of our Constitution and a core value of our national
development road map. A testament to the success of
this measure is that more girls are enrolling in primary
and upper levels of education with an increasingly high
retention rate. Women are also increasingly employed,
recognized and given greater responsibilities in
our public and private sectors. In fact, we achieved
a historical milestone this year, and one which is
unprecedented in our political history, in that, for the
first time, three women were elected to the national
parliament. This positive trend is increasing in our
country at all levels.
We also recognize the critical importance of
protecting our women and girls from violence and
discrimination. Papua New Guinea is taking a
proactive approach through education, advocacy
and legislation to prevent gender-based violence. We have made violence against women and girls a crime
punishable by law. Partnership with all stakeholders,
including our development partners and civil society,
forms an important part of the gender empowerment
and equality issues in our country. In this context, we
commend the funding, substantially from the Australian
Government, that was announced at the margins of the
Pacific Islands Forum in Rarotonga in August 2012, as
well as that from other development partners, including
New Zealand, the United Nations and the United States
of America.
Having acceded to the Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities, Papua New Guinea is now in
the process of ratifying the Convention. Our country is
working with our Pacific Islands Forum member States
to host the Pacific Islands Forum Disability Ministers
Meeting on 3 and 4 October 2012 in Port Moresby.
We are also working towards setting up an
independent national human rights commission and, at
the same time, we are in the process of withdrawing
the seven reservations on the 1951 Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In this
context, we are partnering with Australia to address
human trafficking and human smuggling issues in our
region.
The theme that was chosen for the High-level
Meeting during this session, the rule of law at the
national and international levels, is timely and
commendable. Papua New Guinea fully subscribes, as I
have said, to the principles of the rule of law.
Papua New Guinea also fully subscribes to
disarmament and non-proliferation to secure a peaceful
world. We urge nuclear nations to denuclearize and
those thinking of going nuclear to refrain from doing
so. The Pacific region remains a nuclear-free zone, and
we urge other Member States that have yet to sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty, which prohibits nuclear
weapons in the region, to do so.
We remain concerned about the continued
proliferation of small arms and light weapons. In
this context, we call for the recent impasse on the
negotiations on a global arms trade treaty to be ended
as soon as possible.
Papua New Guinea supports the Group of Seven
Plus forum for its efforts to strengthen peacebuilding
and State-building in fragile and post-conflict countries
and commend Timor-Leste for their leadership. As part
of our national commitment to fostering global peace
and security, Papua New Guinea has commenced its
contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping force
and is looking to expand that contribution.
We remain committed to the United Nations
sustainable development agenda, especially on climate
change, with respect to mitigation and adaptation.
We are committed to working closely with the global
community under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change and subscribe to the
Rio+20 outcome declaration, “The future we want”
(resolution 66/288, annex).
Papua New Guinea recognizes the pivotal role
of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) for
sustainable development. As a founding member of
GGGI, Papua New Guinea pledges to work together
with other stakeholders to ensure the desired outcomes
through the Institute. In this context, we pay tribute to
the work that has been done by the Republic of Korea.
In conclusion, we support the call made by the
Secretary-General for the reform of the United Nations
system. We also again call for the reform of the Security
Council in both the permanent and the non-permanent
categories of members, in order for it to reflect the
geopolitical realities of today."
1714,67,2012,KIR,"﻿I bring warm greetings from the
people of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am privileged to
address this body once again. I join with those who
have gone before me in congratulating Mr. Vuk Jeremić
on assuming the presidency of the Assembly at its
sixty-seventh session. We find ourselves in challenging
times. The work ahead of us during this session reflects
those challenges. I am confident, however, that, under
his able leadership, this Organization will continue its work to improve the quality of life for all members
of our global community, in particular those who are
most vulnerable.
Let me also take this opportunity to acknowledge
with appreciation the commendable leadership of his
predecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, during
the most recent session of the General Assembly.
I also recognize the unwavering dedication of our
Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. With his hand
on the tiller, he continues to steer our Organization
through the complex realities and challenges facing
our world today towards our objectives. In particular, I
would like to acknowledge with deep appreciation his
personal commitment to the issue of climate change
and the plight of the most vulnerable. We in Kiribati
welcomed the Secretary-General to our country
last year, during the first visit ever by anyone in his
position to our part of the world. We were grateful for
the opportunity to show him firsthand the challenges
of living on the front lines of climate change.
In the President’s opening statement yesterday
(see A/67/PV.6), he reminded us that the core function
of the Organization is the maintenance of peace and
security. It is important that we all reflect on what we
have done as individuals to achieve a more peaceful,
secure and better world. We must ask ourselves if
what we are doing is in the collective interest of all the
peoples of this world or of just a select few. We must
look at our efforts as leaders of this global family and
ask ourselves if we are doing the right thing for our
children and their children. I firmly believe that, with all the information
available to us today, we should know exactly what
needs to be done. We know what we have to do but,
for whatever reason, we lack the courage, the fortitude
and the vision to do it. We lack a sense of responsibility
for each other. We are not willing to step out of our
comfort zone and make the necessary sacrifices for the
security and future of all members of our international
community.
It is never too late to do the right thing. History
shows many examples where global action has resulted
in global good. We have managed to secure a relatively
more peaceful world. We have been able to address
some of the major injustices of the past. We have come
together to face down those who seek to achieve their
objectives through terrorist means. However, we must
remain vigilant, as new and emerging forms of security
threats and injustices are cropping up to threaten our
global family.
This will be the seventh time I have had the honour
to address the Assembly in my nine years as President
of my country. Each time I have sought to convey the
same message. Each time I have spoken of the real
and existential threat to my nation. Each time I have
reminded the Assembly of the need for urgent action
to address climate change and sea level rise so as to
ensure the long-term survival of nations like Kiribati.
I frequently find myself watching my grandchildren
and wondering what sort of a future we shall be leaving
them. For their sake, climate change is an issue that I
will continue to talk about for as long as I have breath in
my body. This is a critical issue for the survival of our
people and for all of humanity. It remains the greatest
moral challenge of our time.
Whether or not we are willing to acknowledge it,
climate change and sea-level rise are the result of the
unsustainable use of our planet’s resources. Economic
growth at all costs must not be our mantra, particularly
when it is those who will benefit the least from this
growth who will pay the ultimate price. The Earth is
not ours to do with as we please. We are merely trustees
for future generations, and we ignore this reality at
their peril.
The Organization was founded on the fundamental
principle of sovereign equality. Security issues
affecting each of us must be given due recognition.
We are grateful that the General Assembly agrees that
climate change is a matter warranting the attention of the Security Council. I applaud the commitment of our
Secretary-General to this particular security threat, but
he needs the support of all nations to take the necessary
action to address it.
We must step up our collective efforts to mitigate
global greenhouse-gas emissions. We continue to urge
major greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part. We also
urge development partners to provide the appropriate
level of resources and technology to enable us to deal
with the current and future impacts of climate change
and sea-level rise.
While we are taking adaptative measures to ensure
that Kiribati remains habitable for as long as possible,
we are also preparing for a future when our islands
may no longer be able to sustain our population. We
are looking to improve the skills of our people to a
level where they will be able to compete for jobs in
the international labour market. We want our people to
have the option to migrate with dignity, should that be
a necessary choice in the future, and all the science is
telling us that that is a real possibility.
We note some positive progress made at the recent
climate change talks in Bangkok, building on the
decisions made in Durban last year. However, action
has been too slow in coming. We inch along, when
it is great strides that are needed. On those issues
where we have consensus, we believe the international
community must move to implement agreed action
without delay, while we continue our discussions on
those matters that remain contentious. If we wait for
agreement on everything, then it is going to be a very
long wait and a long process.
It should not come as a surprise that we are off-
track on many of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). While other countries are focusing
their resources on their efforts to meet the MDGs, we,
the most vulnerable countries, continue to spend a
disproportionate level of our limited resources fighting
the onslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on our
homes, livelihoods and public infrastructure. That is a
costly exercise that we cannot afford. We continue to
rely on the goodwill of our partners and members of our
global community in that regard.
We are a nation of water. We are a very-large-ocean
State. We believe that, given the right support, we
can achieve sustainable development through the
utilization of the available resources of our vast
exclusive economic zone. We believe that, in so doing, we can reduce our reliance on development assistance.
I also believe that we may even be able to do away with
development assistance altogether, if we are provided
with the support we need now to develop our capacity
to harvest and process our own resources.
Fisheries remain a major economic resource for my
country, providing between 40 and 50 per cent of our
revenue. Our aspiration is to maximize returns from
that resource, given the current rate of return of between
5 and 8 per cent after landed value alone. We have
started establishing our fish-processing plant through
a public/private partnership. Seabed mining is another
potential source of revenue. However, we are mindful
of the need to take a precautionary approach towards
that particular industry, given the potential damage it
could cause to our pristine marine environment.
We acknowledge the fundamental role of our
environment as a pillar of sustainable development.
Maintaining the health and biodiversity of our oceans
and ecosystems will be critical. Our contribution to
those efforts is the Phoenix Islands Protected Area,
which was once the world’s largest marine protected
area. We have set aside that area as a haven for
marine biodiversity, and that is our gift to humanity
in recognition of the value of protecting our common
heritage.
Ocean conservation is beyond the resources of
any single country. Collaboration on cross-border
initiatives is therefore essential to advancing our
efforts in that regard. At the recent Pacific Islands
Forum meeting in the Cook Islands, the United States
and Kiribati announced plans to collaborate in building
links between our adjoining marine parks in the
Phoenix Islands, under the umbrella of the Phoenix
Ocean Arc. That effort is our joint contribution to the
Pacific Oceanscape Framework. We want to take this
opportunity to invite the international community to
partner with us in that endeavour.
Our message to the international community is that
conservation of biodiversity and marine ecosystems
in the Pacific is not only important to the sustainable
development of Pacific island people. It is also of vital
importance to the rest of the global community. The
international community needs to support those efforts,
not as a hand-out but as an investment for this planet’s
future generations.
In June, we met in Rio de Janeiro to review our
progress 20 years on from the 1992 Earth Summit. Twenty years ago, we agreed that the protection of our
global environment was critical for our future survival
and that the pursuit of development must be based on
the long-term sustainability of our natural resources.
Unfortunately, our track record in delivering on our
undertakings has not been good. In fact, in many
respects, our environment is worse off today than it was
20 years ago. The fine balance keeping our planetary
ecosystem together has been adversely affected by
our pursuit of individual benefits at the expense of the
collective good. While some members of our global
family continue to benefit from the unsustainable
exploitation of resources, others are having to pay the
ultimate price. We do not believe that there is justice
in that.
We renewed our commitment in June to achieving
the future we want. That future will require our
Organization to evolve to reflect the realities of our
time, a time in which new and emerging security
threats and injustices, such as climate change, are
challenging the credibility of our international system
of governance; a time in which the future survival
of some nations is seriously in question; and a time
when all those countries with the ability to do so must
contribute to the prevention of such a calamity or be
forever judged by history. If we are to provide a secure,
peaceful and prosperous future for our children, then
we must go beyond business as usual and deliver now.
In fact, we should have delivered yesterday.
We accept the reality that, during these uncertain
times, there is a need for the United Nations to remain
as relevant and responsive as possible to the ever-
changing needs and challenges of this world. In our
discussions earlier this morning, I was most encouraged
to be assured by the Secretary-General’s commitment
to ensuring that our Organization will undergo reforms
in order to become more efficient, more transparent
and more accountable. We also welcome the Secretary-
General’s proposal to strengthen partnerships with civil
society and the private sector.
In fact, I believe that such a partnership must begin
at the community and national levels before extending
to the regional and international levels.
The fundamental fabric that binds us together as
a family and as humanity is unravelling at the seams.
Maintaining security and ensuring the survival of
people in conflict areas, particularly in the Middle
East and North Africa, remain a major challenge to our
Organization. Let us pray for the sake of those on the front line of the major global challenges that a greater
understanding and stability will prevail.
It is gratifying to note the continued easing of
tension and the improvement of relations across the
Taiwan Straits. We also welcome the inclusion of
countries such as Taiwan in the international activities
of the World Health Assembly. We hope that a
similar understanding will prevail in respect of other
international institutions and processes so that Taiwan
can participate and contribute meaningfully for the
good of humanity.
As we chart the path towards the future that we
want, we must address the fundamental threats to the
very existence of the members of this family of nations.
As a family, we must guarantee the survival of the
members of our community. Climate change must be
resolved before it is too late for those countries on the
front line and, indeed, the whole of humanity.
We need compassionate, visionary and responsible
leadership at this time in order to direct our path
towards a more secure and just future. We owe it to
our children and their children’s children to act and act
soon. So let us pray that God will give us the common
sense to do the right thing for the future of humanity."
1776,52,1997,VUT,"﻿I am privileged today to be able to congratulate
the President, on behalf of the Government of the
Republic of Vanuatu, on his election to preside over the
Assembly at a period critical to the life of the
Organization and its role in future relations between our
countries and peoples. I should like to assure him of the
full support and cooperation my delegation and my
country will lend him and his country, Ukraine, during his
mandate.
I should also like to take this opportunity to express
the warmest congratulations of the Government and
people of Vanuatu to the President of the preceding
session, Ambassador Razali Ismail of Malaysia, on the
role he played during a period in mankind’s history that
15


will be noteworthy for a series of events that were
important both on an international level and on various
regional levels.
This is also a special opportunity for me to welcome
the new Secretary-General of the Organization, Mr. Kofi
Annan, and to reiterate the support of the Republic of
Vanuatu for him in carrying out his mandate as Secretary-
General and, in particular, for the new initiatives he has
taken and committed himself to take in the process of
dialogue and consultation with all Member States with
regard to the future of the Organization.
After more than 50 years of existence, the United
Nations today finds itself facing an economic and
international political situation that is increasingly complex
and particularly more difficult for small developing
countries in general, and especially so for the least
developed small island countries, like the Republic of
Vanuatu.
This situation should be recognized as one of the
major challenges to the international community and one
that must be dealt with through more committed
international cooperation, particularly favourable treatment
being given to meet the specific needs of those countries
and populations that are its victims.
For the Republic of Vanuatu, the highest priority
remains the economic development and social well-being of
its population, more than 80 per cent of whom live in rural
areas or on islands far from the administrative and
commercial centre.
The maintenance of political stability and social
harmony in a country depends and will continue to depend,
first and foremost, on the country’s orientation and
economic development process. The rhetoric of certain
development partners in trying to make their technical and
financial assistance contingent on the political commitment
of government leaders and on the maintenance of peace is
futile with regard to the Pacific region. Such rhetoric tends
rather to challenge the very integrity of these leaders and
their commitment to socio-economic development in their
respective countries.
Genuine international cooperation must not only be
based on the high-priority socio-economic needs of the
developing countries and on the interests of the donors; it
must above all be anchored firmly in respect for the
principles of sovereignty and mutual acknowledgment of
the competence of the national political authorities in the
exercise of their functions in office. In the framework of its
restructuring and in the context of new international
challenges, the United Nations is called upon to play a
leading role in international cooperation on the basis of
these new elements.
In this regard, the Government of Vanuatu most
warmly welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative to
establish a special development account for the
developing country Members. I also wish to recall the
importance and role of regional and subregional forums
in the process of establishing and strengthening
international cooperation. In our part of the world, the
South Pacific Forum and the Melanesian Spearhead
Group are concrete examples of such cooperation and
their initiatives deserve the recognition and support of the
international community.
On 24 October 1995, during the commemoration of
the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the
United Nations Charter, the head of the delegation of
Vanuatu declared from this rostrum the support of the
Republic of Vanuatu for the reform and rational
management of the United Nations system. Today, I
reaffirm the support of my Government and congratulate
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the courage and
determination that he has demonstrated in drafting and
implementing this crucial reform. I fully share the
Secretary-General’s point of view when he emphasizes in
his report that “Reform is not an event; it is a process”
(A/51/950, para. 25).
It is well known that, throughout today’s world,
reform is also the sine qua non for a State’s sustainable
economic and ecological growth and development.
Indeed, the global challenges that States must face require
the constant review and ongoing reform of development
policies and of the institutions of state, in order that the
latter may become instruments and tools adapted to and
honed for the accomplishment of specific tasks, while
contributing to the vision of development that we have set
for ourselves.
Seventeen years after attaining its independence, my
country, Vanuatu, has made great social and economic
strides. However, the disproportionate challenges facing
a small island State such as Vanuatu determined us to
initiate a reform programme early this year. This global
reform programme, as we call it, covers the formal and
informal economic sector as well as the public sector, in
the broad sense of that word. With our reform, we would
equip our country with the means to meet the major
development challenges of the twenty-first century and to
avoid or reduce the effects and risks, natural and
16


otherwise, that stalk all developing countries and small
island States in particular.
This vision of the future that we have crafted for our
country requires the creation of dynamic economic
conditions in which the private sector is the major
protagonist. In most cases, attempts by Governments to act
directly in the production of goods and services have purely
and simply failed. It also requires the establishment and
development of appropriate institutional machinery for
technical and financial assistance that will promote the
creation, development and growth of private enterprise
while placing greater responsibility in the individual.
As the General Assembly is aware, it is not enough to
create conditions for the development of a dynamic private
sector that is a driving force for growth if we seek
development that is economically and ecologically
sustainable and fair. Indeed, in our case, we consider the
reform and revitalization of the State as another sine qua
non of this sustainable and fair development.
Hence, public administration must be made more
effective and freed from any adverse political interference,
allowing us thus to reestablish transparency, confidence,
stability and the security of private investment. Our reform
is designed above all to eliminate existing injustices and not
to create others, which would represent failure and
backsliding. With our reform, we seek equitable
development that takes into account the development needs
of our children and of generations to come. The
redistribution of the benefits of reform and the situation of
women, children and other disadvantaged groups must be
seriously considered in the implementation of this reform.
Guaranteed fairness requires the assignment of the
highest priority to education through the allocation of
available resources. Only an up-to-date and high-quality
education will equip each individual with the necessary
skills and allow him to satisfy his basic needs and maintain
his dignity.
It must be clear to all that the decision of the
Economic and Social Council on 18 July to graduate my
country, the Republic of Vanuatu, from the list of least
developed countries was a surprise. I take this opportunity
to reiterate the position of the Government of Vanuatu, as
reflected in the official correspondence between my
Government and the Secretary-General, the President of the
Economic and Social Council and a certain number of
friendly countries Members of the United Nations.
While recognizing the sensitive nature of this
question, the Government of Vanuatu solemnly calls on
this Assembly to consider putting off the question of
graduation to the year 2000, when the indicators for
identifying least developed countries will be finalized by
the Committee for Development Planning.
My Government recently launched a global reform
programme and will need the full support of the donor
community in order to implement our reform and give our
country the infrastructure indispensable to our growth.
Similarly, during the Global Conference on the
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States held in Barbados, it was decided to develop
indicators for the vulnerability index appropriate to this
category of United Nations Member.
In this context, we consider the decision of the
Committee for Development Planning to be premature
and in no way reflecting the spirit of that United Nations
resolution. Moreover, with more than 80 per cent of our
population living in the countryside on food-producing
subsistence agriculture; a well-paid expatriate population;
and official development assistance equal to the State’s
annual budget and representing 20 per cent of our gross
domestic product, we feel that the Committee for
Development Planning’s decision can only stem from a
lack of adequate information.
We do not understand why least developed countries
in the same situation as Vanuatu are treated differently
and demand that we receive exactly the same treatment as
any that, like us, meets two of the current identifying
indicators for least developed countries, as laid down in
the Committee’s report.
(spoke in English)
As recognized by the Rio Conference and the Global
Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small
Island Developing States, held in Barbados, the issue of
environment and its close association with the concept of
development has become highly complex and sensitive.
The convening of international conferences and the
formulation of international treaties such as the
Framework Convention on Climate Change are a clear
demonstration of the significance of environmental issues
in our development efforts.
Small island countries like Vanuatu and other Pacific
island countries have taken some tough decisions to
17


introduce restrictive measures internally in support of the
international call for environment protection. They have
also committed their Governments and nations to the
principle of instituting a legally binding instrument which
would guarantee the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
to an internationally accepted level.
To the Pacific island countries, particularly the low-
lying nations, a failure to fully address the issue at hand
and to reach an acceptable solution could put into question
the commitment of the international community, and could
constitute a great security risk for our islands and our future
generations.
The Republic of Vanuatu recognizes the United
Nations initiatives and engagement in the globalization and
liberalization of trade. The building up of the multilateral
trading system since 1995 is a manifestation and reflection
of the United Nations effort and desire to create a global
and uniform trading environment that is conducted and
based on the new rules and obligations provided in the
Marrakesh Declaration.
My country has embarked on a wider process of
consultations to seek membership of the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The challenges and opportunities
offered by this new regime are considerable, and therefore
weaker economies like ours require time to adjust to their
economic policies in order to accommodate the prescribed
obligations and requirements of the multilateral trading
system.
In this context, we would like to develop a common
approach through the United Nations system, as well as the
European Union, as our partners, in coming to terms with
the demands and obligations of the newly established
multilateral trading system. While all of us, in particular
small islands and least developed States, recognize the need
to come to terms with the World Trade Organization, we
cannot and should not allow ourselves to be unduly
pressured by its demands on these matters where we need
to protect our trade preferences and interests.
What we perceive to be negative and of less relevance
to us in the World Trade Organization must be changed
according to our interests. There needs to be scope for all
the small and vulnerable States to be accorded sufficient
time to undertake reforms in trade and investment
competitiveness with a view to creating a positive impact
on the economy, particularly in their efforts to source
private capital flows and foreign direct investment.
Allow me at this point to refer to the future relations
between the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific States
(ACP) and the European Union when the current fourth
Lomé Convention expires in the year 2000. After some
25 years, it is important to take stock and reflect on the
challenges, opportunities and weaknesses of the
Convention by reviewing the existing framework of
cooperation. From a wider ACP perspective, there is
generally a stronger desire and willingness to retain and
strengthen the existing framework of cooperation in the
areas of political, economic, trade and development
assistance.
I would like to take this opportunity to strongly urge
the international community, through this fifty-second
session of the General Assembly, to recognize that there
are realities which continue to warrant the need for
continuity of the partnership between the ACP States and
the European Union beyond the year 2000.

In conclusion, allow me to reaffirm my
Government’s support for the process of reforming our
great Organization which was begun by Mr. Kofi Annan
in order to enable it to deal successfully with the
challenges of the twenty-first century."
1810,52,1997,MHL,"﻿I wish to take this
opportunity, on behalf of the Government of the Republic
of the Marshall Islands, to congratulate Mr. Hennadiy
Udovenko on his election and to commend the President of
the fifty-first session of the General Assembly for a job
well done.
My delegation has stressed the importance of
sustainable development ever since we first became a
Member of the United Nations. Our convictions and our
support were most recently reiterated by His Excellency
The Honourable Imata Kabua, President of the Republic
of the Marshall Islands, at the special session of the
General Assembly to review Agenda 21. It is, and will
remain, the cornerstone of the Government’s policy, but
I must recall the sentiments that we have often voiced:
sustainable development is not the easiest path to travel
for a small country like the Marshall Islands. There are
numerous obstacles which we must face and which are
impeding our progress. Please let me try to put this into
better perspective.
Population growth in the Marshall Islands and in
many parts of the Pacific is of great concern to our
Governments. It has been as high as 4.2 per cent but now
appears to be slowing down to 3.5 per cent. This is
nevertheless far too high a figure for our small country to
sustain. With rather limited resource bases to begin with,
it is difficult to imagine what job opportunities will have
to be created for new generations. We are already facing
problems with layoffs in the public sector. Granted, it was
much too large. It was at one point almost 60 per cent of
the work force but is now down to 43 per cent. This is
still a very high number, and we are looking into all sorts
of methods of increasing private sector investment to
increase private sector employment.
But population growth also has a negative impact on
our local environment. There is a growing trend of
migration to the two main urban centres of the Marshall
Islands — Majuro, the capital, and Ebeye, close to the
United States base at Kwajalein. These areas are
becoming increasingly crowded, and there is an urgent
need to find local solutions. There is a great need to
improve urban conditions, but at the same time we also
wish to reduce the rate at which the urban centre
population grows.
In a democracy like ours, it is difficult to try to
impose any restrictions; instead, we have tried to look
into incentives. One idea that has been tried is job
creation in the outer islands. We have long been aware of
the potential that the outer islands could have if there
were only more investment in sustainable development
projects.
Population growth is causing difficulties for the
country in many diverse fields, but Government and local
authority action is making some progress. Our youth and
church groups in particular are taking up this issue as a
main concern for the future. But this is only one of many
problem which we have to face.
22


We have by no means given up on the struggle to
achieve sustainable development and the improvement of
living standards in the Marshall Islands. On the
Government side we are first of all looking at how existing
structures can be reformed and how better to utilize our
resources. We are interested in any innovations that could
help us. But it is increasingly clear that if we are to break
out of destructive cycles and move away from
unsustainable patterns, then we must all work together.
There will continue to be a need for external assistance to
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, but this can and must
be channelled in a more appropriate manner.
Last year we reported that the damage caused by
nuclear-weapons testing in the Marshall Islands was far
more extensive and devastating than previously understood.
We now know that many more islands and groups of
people were affected. The testing programme in the
Marshall Islands helped the international community
understand the effects of nuclear weapons on people and
the environment. This knowledge was a contributing factor
to the prevention of nuclear war during the cold-war era. In
the Marshall Islands, we believe that we played a
significant role in bringing about the end of the cold war.
We share the commitment of the United Nations to world
peace, security and disarmament.
There is little question that the nuclear-testing
programme in the Marshall Islands was the defining
experience of the Marshallese people in this century. The
67 nuclear-weapon tests conducted in our country and the
tests conducted on our neighbouring Pacific islands
contaminated every inch of our environment and exposed
each one of our citizens to radiation. As a result, my
Government is desperately seeking resources to address the
direct medical and environmental consequences of radiation
exposure, since we do not have sufficient funds. We are
also struggling to deal with the indirect problems of the
displacement of, and the lack of adequate medical care for,
the affected population. It places an additional burden on
our already constrained medical care resources.
We cannot solve these problems on our own, and we
feel obliged to appeal to the international community. We
certainly appreciate all efforts to address our problems
made by our former administering authority, and we are
encouraged by recent indications that the United States is
willing to address outstanding concerns. Yet present efforts
to address lingering consequences are inadequate.
Marshallese people have the basic human right, like all
people throughout the world, to a healthy and clean
environment. We are justified, therefore, in asking
assistance in restoring our lands and returning our
displaced populations to a safe environment.
In this regard the United Nations has an important
role to play. We are encouraged that the International
Atomic Energy Agency is in the process of conducting a
survey in the northern areas of the Marshall Islands. But
another body, the United Nations Scientific Committee on
the Effects of Atomic Radiation, could in our view have
a much greater role. We have noted the terms of
reference of that Scientific Committee, and we see no
reason why it cannot undertake studies that could in the
future assist those populations that are suffering from the
effects of atomic radiation. In our view it must go beyond
a simple academic understanding and have a role that
would allow more interaction with affected countries. I
was also a little puzzled by the brevity of the Scientific
Committee’s last report — only one page. We would like
to request that the Committee expand its scope of work,
to see how it could look into areas, like the Marshall
Islands, affected by nuclear tests. We would be willing to
assist the Scientific Committee in obtaining, for its
consideration, documents and declassified information
pertaining to nuclear testing and its effects on people. My
delegation intends to review this issue in the Fourth
Committee.
My country, all low-lying atolls, with no mountains,
is also facing a most serious threat of sea level rise.
While we are here discussing this issue, the effects of
erosion, storms and tide surges are already being felt in
the Marshall Islands. We are of the firm opinion that the
scientists working with the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) have by now made such a
convincing argument about this troubling issue. This
consensus has been reflected in the acceptance by all
Governments concerned of the Second Assessment Report
of the IPCC. As a result of this acceptance of the
scientific proof, we would have expected, at the very
least, that the developed countries would agree to
undertake so-called no-regrets measures. Such measures
seek to improve efficiency and reduce waste, and to
develop alternative sources of energy. My Government
fully supports such initiatives, as they seem to us to be a
perfectly sensible way to begin addressing climate change.
But we are finding that there is resistance even to such a
modest idea aimed at trying to halt this irresponsible
waste of natural resources and fossil fuels. I have been
hearing reports that in the negotiating process there are
still those countries that seek to undermine the process
itself for their own short-term gains. I can only say that
my Government is saddened by these countries’ attitude.
23


For this reason, a Pacific regional expert group has warned
that we may have to look at our migration options, rather
than adaptation options. Are we willing to see the
disappearance of whole countries for the sake of short-term
economic gain?
A recent newspaper ad campaign here in the United
States has further attempted to add confusion and doubt in
regard to the scientific evidence, and is also spreading
alarmist doomsday scenarios for the economies of the
developed countries. This is simply a misrepresentation of
what is being discussed and of what has been proposed, as
well as what is likely to be the result if we do not act now.
I was further amazed at seeing television ads stating similar
misleading information. The question that appears to be
raised is that the developed countries will pay a heavy
financial price for ineffective measures. The suggestion here
is that climate change is a preposterous plot by developing
countries to dominate the industrialized economies. But
climate change would be costly to us all. The destruction of
small island developing States and other low-lying areas
will only be the first marker as the flood gates open for
full-blown climate change. There should be no
misconception that there is any other option except action
to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I wish to
state our position, supported by scientists, economists and
concerned people, that inaction will result in a disaster for
mankind. What we need as the first step are significant,
legally binding cuts in the greenhouse gas emissions of the
industrialized world.
Please allow me to state our gratitude to and full
support for the Secretary-General in his efforts and
proposals to reform the United Nations. His report has been
studied by our officials, and we have concluded that we
must give the Secretary-General our full backing on his
vision for a reformed United Nations. I have some
experience with the difficulties of bringing reform to an
unwilling system, and we understand fully what he is going
through. But reform is crucial if we are to have a forward-
looking and effective United Nations, a United Nations that
can assist us developing countries in our search for
sustainable development. All the national efforts of
countries like the Marshall Islands require an international
support structure that is conducive to sustainable
development goals. The United Nations has a crucial and
vital role, and we must maintain its leadership and
coordination function.
Reform of the United Nations requires that the
Member States recommit themselves to their treaty
obligations to negotiate in good faith and find the mutually
beneficial steps that we need to take. I wish to reiterate
the support which my Government has given to the
proposals that have come out of the Committee on
Contributions as a good starting point for financial
reform. Let us take these modest first steps, and then in
the next phase we can finish the reform.
Reform will also have to involve the expansion of
the Security Council. We have stated our support for
various proposals in past general debates, and we have
been involved in the working groups. Last week the
Prime Minister of Fiji reiterated their proposal to give
more prominence to the Pacific as a subregion of the
Asian Group. This is an idea that we wholeheartedly
embrace. It has captured a very important facet of the
reasons why we need to have expansion — that is, to
facilitate the participation of all countries in the Security
Council. Our countries would feel much more
comfortable with the decisions of the Security Council if
we had a better opportunity to be a member. There is also
a need to review the use and extent of the veto power,
and whether there should in fact be any new permanent
members of the Security Council. It may well be that a
more equitable rotation structure would suffice.
These are some of the most pressing issues before
this session of the General Assembly. The connection
between what occurs in the international community and
the impact the results have on individual countries should
be made clearer. The sustainable development process
that we wish to work towards requires a great effort on
the part of the Marshall Islands Government and
citizenry.
Similarly, the international community as a whole
must be involved in charting a more democratic and
cooperative future in this singular world organization. We
feel that we deserve the support of the international
community for our own efforts, and we pledge to work
constructively with the United Nations system and donor
community.










"
1858,52,1997,PNG,"﻿On behalf of the
people and Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish to
join previous speakers in conveying our felicitations to you,
Sir, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-second
session of the General Assembly. The Papua New Guinea
delegation is confident that you will guide this session to a
successful conclusion.
May I also take this opportunity to express my sincere
gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador
Razali Ismail of Malaysia, for his energetic, visionary and
outstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-
first session of the General Assembly.
At the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations,
world leaders reaffirmed their resolute commitment to
uphold the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter
of the United Nations. They pledged their support for the
pivotal role of the United Nations in building international
cooperation and partnership in development and in
engendering trust and confidence among nations and
peoples in order to foster world peace and security.
No human institution is perfect, and the United
Nations is no exception. It has nonetheless withstood the
test of time. The shortcomings of our collective
endeavours have necessitated efforts for constructive
reform and measures directed at strengthening and
reinvigorating the United Nations, our paramount
Organization.
Papua New Guinea has always believed, and
continues to believe, in the utility of the United Nations,
and in this context commends the Secretary-General, His
Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his bold initiative in
proposing for our consideration a comprehensive reform
package aimed at making the United Nations more
responsive to the changing international situation.
In his proposal, the Secretary-General emphasized
that the principal objective of the reform is not only to
make the United Nations efficient and effective but also
to improve its delivery system and operational coherency
through management innovations. Papua New Guinea
fully supports these principal objectives of the proposed
reform package. The overall direction of reform should
and must be tailored towards strengthening the United
Nations system in order to better serve the needs and
aspirations of its Members. It makes eminent sense for us
to move from merely debating issues to determining
practical steps and strategies that would make our
Organization more responsive and capable of meeting the
ever-changing challenges of globalization and
modernization as we enter the next century.


These changes are necessary to enhance public
confidence in the United Nations and to improve its
capacity to build partnership between Governments and
civil society. This will enable the Organization to meet the
daunting challenges of economic development faced by our
global community and those posed by the political and
ideological differences afflicting nations today.
The proposed reforms stem in part from the need to
ensure the operational viability and sustainability of the
activities of the United Nations. Papua New Guinea is fully
aware of the predicament of the United Nations — starved
of much needed financial resources for its operations to the
point of being insolvent. We cannot allow such a situation
to persist.
We agree with and applaud the role of the
Organization in development — in framing structures and
policies that will enhance the technological capacities of
developing countries and improve their effective
participation in international markets, including their access
to credit and their ability to acquire information
technologies.
Regarding priorities, Papua New Guinea is gravely
concerned at the lack of full implementation of a number of
initiatives and programmes undertaken by the United
Nations, in particular with respect to such critical areas as
the empowerment of women, child care, the protection of
our global environment, poverty eradication and sustainable
development.
It is critical to be aware that organizational reform
alone cannot guarantee the effective delivery of services.
The United Nations needs more than bureaucratic and
technocratic innovations. It needs our concerted action. It is
therefore imperative that we as Members commit ourselves
to encouraging the development of genuine partnerships and
seriously take urgent and practical measures to remove the
obstacles and barriers that exist between developed and
developing countries.
In addition to its traditional role in the maintenance of
peace and security, this paramount international body must
be equipped and strengthened to do more in framing
international treaties and standards and in encouraging
international norms and practices that will bring about
equitable economic development and social justice for all
peoples. Equity and justice in all spheres of development
should be our ultimate objective.
Consistent with the reform process, we see merit and
value in revising the regional groupings within the context
of the United Nations to reflect present geopolitical
realities. In this regard, we support the calls made by
New Zealand and others in the South Pacific region for
the consideration of their inclusion in the Asia-Pacific
grouping.
I now turn to the question of the reform of the
Security Council, which is an important decision-making
organ of the United Nations on global security concerns.
As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Papua New
Guinea fully supports the declaration adopted by the non-
aligned Ministers at the twelfth Ministerial Conference of
the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries — held in New
Delhi, India, in April 1997 — and reaffirmed more
recently in New York on 26 September last. The
composition and modus operandi of the Security Council
must reflect the changes that have taken place since its
formative years, and, more importantly, must mirror
current geopolitical and economic realities.
Papua New Guinea believes that the reform and
expansion of the Security Council should be guided by
the principle of the sovereign equality of States and
equitable geographical distribution. It should also take
into consideration the need for transparency,
accountability and democratization of the working
methods and procedures of the Security Council,
including its decision-making processes.
The reform of the Security Council should be
comprehensive and based on universal values in order to
enhance its legitimacy. More importantly, the reformed
Security Council should allow for equitable representation
by developing countries. On the question of permanent
membership, we reiterate our position on the inclusion of
Japan and Germany from the industrialized States and
also support the fair representation of developing
countries as additional permanent members, particularly
those that have the capacity and ability to contribute to
world affairs.
Papua New Guinea strongly supports the view that
there should be no distinction in terms of the privileges
accorded to permanent members, particularly in relation
to the exercise of the veto power. In other words, all
permanent members of a reformed Security Council
should enjoy the same privileges so as to maintain
geopolitical equity and balance.
2


It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the
contradictory positions of some of our members, who
purport to be champions and defenders of human rights
issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that
directly deny genuine democratic representation and the
rights of people to govern themselves in a manner
consistent with their political aspirations.
Having achieved decolonization in many parts of the
globe — of which the United Nations can be proud — we
would be failing in our noble duty if we were to ignore the
concerns and aspirations of the peoples of the remaining 17
Non-Self-Governing Territories, some of them in the South
Pacific, which are still struggling to establish their own
political autonomy, and even to exercise their right of self-
determination. Given the importance we attach to this issue,
Papua New Guinea is gravely concerned that recent
initiatives in relation to the United Nations programme on
decolonization have seriously eroded the importance of the
political essence of that programme and have impacted
negatively on it. We hope that this anomaly can be resolved
quickly and amicably.
Papua New Guinea wishes to recall that many of us
represented here would not have taken our place in this
forum had we not been allowed the opportunity to exercise
that right. We therefore urge this body to adopt a more
serious and aggressive approach to the implementation of
the decolonization programme of the United Nations. At the
recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Rarotonga,
Cook Islands, the States members of the South Pacific
Forum reaffirmed their support for the decolonization
process.
The Non-Self-Governing Territory of New Caledonia
continues to be of great interest to the South Pacific Forum,
and we have over the years followed developments there in
relation to the Matignon Accords. Early this year we
mounted, with the help of the Government of France and
the authorities in New Caledonia, a Forum ministerial
mission to the Territory. We are pleased to note that all
parties to the Matignon Accords appear to be satisfied with
the progress made in implementing the Accords. Papua
New Guinea continues to recognize the right of the people
of New Caledonia to self-determination and urges all
parties in the Territory to maintain their commitment to
reaching a negotiated solution as a successor arrangement
to the 1988 Matignon Accords. This negotiated successor
solution must take into account the wishes of all
communities, including concerns on the changing
demographic composition of New Caledonia.
The economic prosperity and political developments
and changes in the Asia-Pacific region continue to be of
interest to Papua New Guinea. As a special observer of
the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),
we were heartened by the initiatives taken by ASEAN
leaders to bring the belligerent parties in Cambodia to the
table for urgent negotiations for peace and security. It is
our hope that the people of that ancient civilization will
return to their daily lives in a peaceful and secure
environment once more.
The ongoing difficulties in the Korean peninsula and
the competing territorial claims in the South China Sea
continue to concern my Government, because they all
have a bearing on the overall maintenance of regional and
international security, as well as on other forms of
cooperation.
While we do not understate the importance and
value of our diplomatic relations with the People’s
Republic of China, we have, however, on a number of
occasions urged both Beijing and Taipei to resolve their
fundamental differences with the aim of maintaining an
amicable coexistence.
In view of the changing international climate
characterized by global interdependence, it is important
for all peace-loving States to make every effort to
minimize areas of hostility that could seriously undermine
international peace and security. The United Nations
therefore has an obligation to assist in maintaining a
secure global environment in which economic growth and
other forms of development can continue to thrive for the
benefit and common good of all peoples of the world.
In its efforts to attain economic prosperity, Papua
New Guinea has had to engage all economic entities in
our trade and commercial relations. Consistent with our
obligation to assure our people of a better future, we
intend to expand our economic ties with trading partners
that have demonstrated their willingness to assist without
our having to compromise various aspects of our existing
relations with our partners.
It is in this regard that we recognize Taiwan as a
dynamic economy and trading partner without
compromising our one-China policy. Since Taiwan
participates in such organizations as the Asian
Development Bank, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council, the World Trade Organization and
the South Pacific Forum as a dialogue partner, I cannot
3


see any reason why we should not deal directly with
Taiwan on trade and economic matters.
The world has witnessed once again the derailment of
the peace process in the Middle East. We call on the
leaders of both Israel and Palestine to cooperate with
United Nations efforts to reach an amicable solution to
avert further violence, and to focus on the path to peace.
Papua New Guinea strongly believes that the rights of the
Palestinian people over their homeland and their freedom to
establish their own Government and identity are paramount
among the conditions that could lead to enduring peace.
We are encouraged to see positive signs of
appeasement in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless, given the tense
situation that exists in that region, we urge those in
positions of authority, including all leaders in that part of
the world, to resolve their differences peacefully to prevent
further bloodshed. In this context, we are heartened to see
the Organization of African Unity playing a critical role in
the endeavour to bring about peace and stability in the
Great Lakes region. The crisis in Sierra Leone needs urgent
attention, and we join the Secretary-General’s call to the
leaders of the military junta and support his continuing
efforts to encourage them to respect the rule of law and
make every effort to restore democracy in that country.
On the regional front, Papua New Guinea is taking a
major initiative in setting up the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (APEC) regional centre in Port
Moresby. We would like to offer our gratitude for the
support given by the States members of the South Pacific
Forum in our efforts to set up this centre. The objective of
the APEC centre is to assist in the area of capacity-building
in the economies of 13 small island developing States in
our region as we prepare to meet the challenges of
globalization and liberalization. We are also grateful for the
support provided by the United Nations Development
Programme.
At the recent summit of the Heads of the South
Pacific Forum countries, the leaders reaffirmed our
commitment to maintaining a nuclear-free zone in the South
Pacific consistent with the overall objectives of the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We
welcomed the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty and reiterated our support for banning the
transboundary movement of radioactive and other hazardous
wastes in the region, and in particular for the Vienna
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the
draft Convention on Supplementary Funding.
In this context, we welcome the ratification by the
United Kingdom of the protocols to the South Pacific
Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, known as the Treaty of
Rarotonga. We are still hopeful that the United States of
America will do likewise, and call upon it to do so at the
earliest possible opportunity.
At the last session of the General Assembly, we
sought and forged new agreements, including our
relationship with the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons. We also expressed our support for an
international convention to ban all anti-personnel mines,
and have participated in the Ottawa process, most recently
at Oslo. Like other members of this body, Papua New
Guinea is making the necessary arrangements to become
a party to that historic Treaty when it opens for signature
later this year.
In a few months we will usher in the International
Year of the Ocean. Like other South Pacific Forum
countries, Papua New Guinea has an affinity for the sea
which cannot be overstated. It is, for the greater part, the
source of our livelihood.
We urge the United Nations to continue to play a
major role in ensuring global awareness of sustainable
use, conservation and management of marine resources.
In this regard, we call on the international community to
coordinate efforts to implement the priorities agreed upon
during the special session of the General Assembly on the
environment and sustainable development. We are gravely
concerned that much of the outcome of the special session
will remain the province of historians and academics, if
not given practical effect. We urge that greater attention
be given to the special needs and concerns of the small
island developing countries.
An environmental issue of great importance and
relevance to Papua New Guinea and other small island
States in the South Pacific region is the impact of
greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing rising sea
levels and changing weather patterns in many member
countries, especially low lying island nations.
This issue was given priority attention at the recent
South Pacific Forum meeting in Rarotonga, Cook Islands,
where the Forum countries expressed deep concerns about
the insufficient progress made by the countries which
contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
As a member of the South Pacific Forum, Papua
New Guinea strongly urges all countries concerned to
4


make additional efforts in meeting commitments under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(FCCC). We also urge all parties to the FCCC to consider
fully the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) draft
protocol during the ongoing negotiations, especially at the
forthcoming Kyoto conference, in order to pursue the
greatest possible level of net reduction in global greenhouse
gas emissions by means of a legally binding protocol or
other legal instrument.
On Bougainville, let me reassure this body that Papua
New Guinea, as I stated earlier this year in the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights, remains fully
committed to a peaceful and enduring resolution of the
crisis. It is absolutely clear that the people of Papua New
Guinea, including the majority of Bougainvillians, want
peace and will pursue a peaceful solution by every available
means. As in the past, we will continue to give the people
of Bougainville every opportunity to participate fully in the
reconciliation process.
My Government is mindful of the effects of the crisis
on our region, particularly of the spillover effects on our
close neighbours. We wish to take this opportunity to thank
the neighbouring countries in our region for their assistance
in the peace process. I would like to acknowledge the
contributions of Australia and, in particular, New Zealand,
in initiating and facilitating the peace conference of all
Bougainvillian leaders which resulted in the signing of the
Burnham Declaration last July. A follow-up meeting —
Burnham Talks II — between Bougainvillian leaders and
representatives of Papua New Guinea’s Government is
currently under way in New Zealand. We are optimistic and
confident that we can resolve the crisis within the
framework of the Papua New Guinea Constitution.
Let me also take this opportunity to thank, on behalf
of my Government and people, the previous and current
Governments of the Solomon Islands and their people for
their tolerance and understanding, particularly when they
have had to bear the full weight of the spillover effects. I
want to thank them also for agreeing with us to put in place
in the last 12 months two important bilateral treaties: the
comprehensive framework treaty guiding bilateral relations
and the basic border agreement. These treaties set the
parameters within which our bilateral relations are
conducted, including the legal mechanisms for consultation
and dialogue relating to a more effective management of
our common border, which is critical to the containment of
the Bougainville crisis, including its spillover effects.
My Government also offers its gratitude to the
leaders of the South Pacific Forum for recognizing
Bougainville as an integral part of Papua New Guinea,
and for their acknowledgment of the peace efforts
concerning Bougainville by all parties involved, including
Bougainvillians and their leaders, the Papua New Guinea
Government, and the Governments of the Solomon
Islands, Australia and New Zealand.
In conclusion, let me echo what other speakers have
said before me. As we prepare to meet the dawn of the
next millennium, let us commit ourselves to building
genuine partnerships in development that will ensure a
secure environment for our present and future generations.
We do not and should not expect guarantees, but we
shall look far and wide in our search for safeguards. We
do not want and shall not seek handouts; however, we
demand equity and greater participation to foster and
expand opportunities for our peoples.
It is only through the development of genuine
partnerships and the enhancement of equity and justice in
global trade and investments that we can improve the
socio-economic conditions of our people, ensure their
prosperity, and guarantee the safety of our global
environment, without which there is no hope for the
attainment of enduring peace in our societies today and in
future. Only when such peace has been attained can we
truly say that we have lived up to our obligations, for the
interests and common good of humanity.





"
1887,52,1997,AUS,"﻿Let me begin by
congratulating Mr. Udovenko on his election as President
of the General Assembly at this fifty-second session. The
country and the Group he represents have seen great
changes in the last decade. It therefore seems particularly
fitting that he is presiding over a General Assembly
which will lay the foundation for significant changes to
the United Nations itself — changes which must equip it
better for the new and potentially more cooperative
international environment in which we find ourselves.
It is thus not only right but necessary that reform is
the major theme of the United Nations at present, and of
this General Assembly in particular. We would like to
thank the former President of the Assembly, Ambassador
Razali, for the outstanding contribution he made to
pursuing the reform agenda during his presidency, notably
16


in his capacity as Chairman of the General Assembly
Working Groups.
Today I want to concentrate on three issues in
particular: reform of the United Nations; reorienting our
approach to human rights so as to promote cooperation and
institution building, creating durable structures to give
substance to the goals set out in the Charter of the United
Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
other international human rights instruments; and
reconfiguring the traditional United Nations groups better
to reflect the regional groupings of the contemporary world.
In dealing with reform, my purpose is to build a world
for the next generation, and I am inspired by the hope and
aspirations of the next generation.
In that context, I am pleased that we are joined in the
General Assembly today by Mr. Perry Cross, a
distinguished and courageous young Australian who is
leading the fight against paralysis. He exemplifies the
Australian belief that individuals with a will and a practical
focus can make a difference in fighting barriers and
reforming structures which are representative of an earlier
era.
Australia wants to work with you, Sir, and with the
Secretary-General and all Members of the United Nations,
to ensure that by the end of this session of the General
Assembly further, substantive progress has been made in
the three critical areas of reform: financial reform and
resolution of the crisis surrounding the United Nations
budget and scale of assessments; reform of the Security
Council; and reform of the Organization.
When I made my first statement to the Assembly last
year, I stressed the need to move ahead urgently with
reform and the reinvigoration of this important
Organization, to ensure its future effectiveness and
relevance. This year reform has been given real impetus by
the new Secretary-General, whose appointment Australia
warmly welcomed. Both in March and in July this year he
announced significant organizational reforms aimed at the
renewal of this body. I have enthusiastically supported these
initiatives. We must now build on them.
We share the Secretary-General’s conclusions about
the shortcomings of the United Nations. The Organization’s
mission, as enshrined in the Charter, has been repeatedly
reaffirmed and remains valid today. But the machinery and
the working methods to pursue that mission need thorough
review and revision. We agree that there is too much
fragmentation of structures, too much rigidity within
bodies and too much emphasis on bureaucracy and
process.
I would like to highlight in particular the reforms
suggested to the United Nations structure and to the
Secretariat. The integration of 12 secretariats and entities
into 5, and the proposed consolidation of five
intergovernmental bodies into two are particularly
welcome. They will help streamline and remove
unnecessary bureaucratic structure and duplication from
the Secretariat. It is an approach we commend also to the
specialized agencies as Member nations seek to streamline
and even merge some of these bodies.
Important steps are proposed in reforming the way
the Secretariat works. We applaud the removal of 1,000
staff posts and the cutting of administrative costs by one
third to which the Secretary-General has committed
himself. We also wish to see all Secretariat staff move to
fixed-term, renewable contracts to allow for greater
employment flexibility in the Organization. We support
the introduction of a merit-based promotion system and
performance appraisal in the place of a system where
seniority plays a disproportionate role. We also encourage
management to improve training opportunities for junior
as well as senior staff.
These reforms will not only make the United
Nations work better, but also provide real savings. These
savings will be available for programmes, programmes
which benefit all of us, but especially support the
developing Members of the United Nations. Thus it is a
package which is in the interests of all, and deserves
support from all. We believe the Assembly needs to
provide broad endorsement of the package as a whole
early in this session to allow the reform process to
proceed, even if some details are negotiated subsequently.
But I acknowledge that for reform to succeed and
for the United Nations to carry out its mandate adequate
resources must be made available to run the Organization.
Australia continues to meet all its financial obligations in
full and on time and without conditions, and seeks the
same commitment from all our fellow Members. We
continue to believe that the negotiation of financial
reforms would be facilitated by early settlement of all
unpaid contributions. The adoption of a responsible negative-
growth budget and a new scale of assessments which
accurately reflects relative shares of national income and
thus the principle of capacity to pay will also be key
issues at this year’s session. It is important that the result
17


ensures the burden of supporting the Organization falls
fairly on Member States.
Australia remains committed to an expanded, more
representative and transparent Security Council, better able
to tackle the challenges of the twenty-first century. It
should include as permanent members important Powers
able to make a major contribution to international peace and
security, particularly at this time Japan and Germany. It
should also include permanent seats for under-represented
regions as well as additional non-permanent seats.
Middle Powers such as Australia have made a
significant contribution to the United Nations since its
foundation, notably in disarmament, development,
peacekeeping and human rights. We are concerned that the
interests of small and medium-sized countries not be
forgotten in this exercise. In this context, and because of
our long-standing historical concerns about the veto, we
would like to see an expansion of the Council accompanied
by a new understanding on the application of the veto. We
would also support a review of any new arrangements after
10 years so that countries like Australia and all other
members of the international community have a further
opportunity to examine the size, composition and working
methods of the Council.
I am optimistic about what can be achieved by the
United Nations if we can bring about some essential
reforms which would make the Organization function more
efficiently and effectively. Let me mention one of the areas
in which the United Nations has proven it can function
effectively: as a forum and catalyst for international arms
control and disarmament efforts.
In recent years we have witnessed several landmark
developments in this field, notably the indefinite extension
of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
and the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty. The General Assembly was the forum, one year
ago, for the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty, and Australia is particularly proud to have been
able to play a role in that historic event.
There are many challenges ahead as we work with,
and through, the United Nations to reduce global stockpiles
of conventional and non-conventional weapons and to make
the world a safer and more humane place. Let me single
out two. The immediate commencement and early
conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off
treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international
community as the next major goal for nuclear non-
proliferation and disarmament efforts, most recently by
the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty —
which now has more members than the United Nations
itself — at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth
Review Conference in 2000.
The Canberra Commission on the Elimination of
Nuclear Weapons also identified an agreement to cease
the production of fissile material for nuclear explosive
purposes as an important step towards the elimination of
nuclear weapons. Capping the amount of nuclear material
available for nuclear weapons use by extending
safeguards coverage over currently unsafeguarded,
sensitive nuclear facilities would in itself be a significant
achievement for international peace and security, quite
apart from its significance as a step towards the ultimate
elimination of nuclear weapons.
As I said to the Committee on Disarmament in
January this year, the achievement of a fissile material
cut-off treaty is a priority objective for Australia, and I
now commit Australia to redoubling its efforts to achieve
a cut-off treaty at the earliest possible date. We must not
allow ourselves to be put off by the obstacles that
currently face the achievement of this goal.
The effective elimination of landmines as a weapon
of war is another important task facing the United Nations
collectively and its members individually. I have been
gratified by the gains made to date, through the Ottawa
process, through the Inhumane Weapons Convention,
through national and regional measures and, perhaps most
important, through enhanced contributions to demining
and mine-victim assistance programmes to address the
terrible human toll of anti-personnel landmines. We owe
it to the victims of anti-personnel landmines to continue
working through all avenues to achieve a real and lasting
solution to the global landmines problem.
The elimination of landmines is one necessary step
in creating a more humane world, a world where
individual human rights can demand proper respect. But
further measures need to be taken involving the
establishment of durable national human rights institutions
to advance the goals to which our international human
rights treaty commitments aspire. We are encouraged by
and support the proposal to integrate human rights issues
more fully into a range of United Nations activities. In
our view, the linkages between respect for human rights,
good governance and sustainable development are
important. The fact that all four Executive Committees
established by the Secretary-General will take human
18


rights issues into account in their deliberations should
ensure that more effective coordination is possible across
United Nations activities. We warmly welcome also the
steps taken by the Secretary General to reform and
reinvigorate the Secretariat’s organizational structure to
support human rights, particularly the consolidation of the
Office of the High Commissioner and the Centre for
Human Rights into a single office. His appointment of the
former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, as High
Commissioner for Human Rights is an excellent choice. We
pledge ourselves to support her in her task.
Another important recent development at the
international level has been the negotiation of a draft statute
for an international criminal court. Australia is strongly
committed to the early establishment of the court as a
major human rights objective. We urge all nations to
support by consensus the proposed resolution at this
General Assembly calling for the convening of a diplomatic
conference in June 1998 to finalize and adopt the statute of
the court.
As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we pay tribute to
the universal standards the Declaration has helped to
establish. Let us never forget as well that the Declaration,
along with the two International Covenants, and the whole
body of treaty law and practice that has since developed,
was reaffirmed by all nations at the Vienna World
Conference on Human Rights in 1993.
Australia is a nation committed to the advancement of
human rights and regards human rights issues as integral to
its diplomacy. However, the Australian Government does
not want the important area of human rights to become an
unproductive battleground or an environment for
sloganeering. What we seek is results, not rhetoric, with the
outcome being genuine improvements in human rights. The
real basis for a sustained improvement in the quality of
human rights needs to be through domestic reform founded
on working institutions that guarantee participation and
accountability. Reform of the institutions of civil
governance must come from within. It is not something that
can be imposed from outside, for if there is not the political
will and the people with the knowledge and a commitment
to making those institutions work, then they will simply
founder. Almost all nations have dark moments in their
history where abuses have occurred, where vigilance has
failed. Abuses and corruption are most likely to disappear
when there are institutions established to bring light into
this darkness.
All too often, however, instead of working patiently
to encourage and help others to build these institutions,
countries have tended to address issues of human rights
by criticism alone. There is no doubt that in the 52 years
since the United Nations was established the world has
witnessed many egregious and vile acts committed for the
most inhumane of reasons, and deserving the strongest
condemnation. However, the condemnatory approach
alone has only limited practical value.
We need to recognize that in practical terms
protecting human rights must primarily be done at the
national level. The international human rights system,
which we have worked hard to build, inevitably has a
broad focus and a limited ability to assist States to
implement agreed standards. Regional human rights
mechanisms also have a role, and we should do what we
can to encourage their establishment and strengthening,
including in the Asia-Pacific. However, it is clear that the
ability of each State effectively to protect human rights
depends to a significant degree on the strength of its own
institutions, including a representative legislature, an
accountable executive and an independent judiciary. A
vigorous civil society is another important element in
creating a culture of human rights.
A critical element that has often been undervalued in
the national implementation of human rights standards is
the importance of effective institutions as a means to
achieving good governance. It is this institution-based
good governance that offers a real hope of eradicating the
randomness and violence that can characterize systems
where there is neither popular participation nor genuine
accountability.
Good governance creates the environment in which
civil and political rights are respected and protected. Good
governance also promotes an environment for sound
economic management and sustainable use of resources to
increase prosperity. These conditions are important to the
protection of economic, social and cultural rights.
At the same time, the exercise of civil and political
rights through participatory processes is essential to good
governance because it helps ensure governmental
accountability and effectiveness. The interlinkages are
such that action in one area of human rights has a
positive reinforcing effect on other dimensions of human
rights, making all human rights indivisible.
Accountability, participation and effective institutions are
three fundamental principles necessary for the protection
of human rights.
19


It is with all this in mind that Australia gives priority
to institution building in the human rights field. One of the
most significant developments in recent years has been the
spread of national institutions for the promotion of human
rights. Such institutions, able to work with Governments
and civil society, can reflect to a significant degree the
different cultures and local conditions of the societies in
which they are established, while remaining consistent with
international human rights standards. Moreover, it is worth
noting that the General Assembly has endorsed a set of
minimum standards for such institutions — the so-called
Paris principles. Despite considerable early scepticism,
recent experience has been very positive, and many
Governments and non-governmental organizations are now
looking positively at independent national institutions as an
important means to promote and protect human rights. The
generally positive view of the work of national institutions
held by most States was reflected in the adoption by
consensus of Australia’s resolution on this subject at this
year’s session of the Commission on Human Rights, with
an increased number of co-sponsors.
Developing countries are showing rapidly increasing
interest in establishing or strengthening existing national
human rights institutions, as a constructive way to take
positive action at the national level, bearing in mind
national circumstances, to promote respect for human
rights. Important examples of human rights institutions
recently established in my part of the world that are making
a difference on the ground include those in India and
Indonesia. I was encouraged recently by the statement of
Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister that he intends to
press ahead to establish a human rights commission in the
near future.
We will also watch with expectation the development
of the proposed Cambodian national human rights
commission. A credible and independent human rights
commission, along with a genuinely independent national
electoral commission, could make an important contribution
to protecting stability and promoting the observance of
human rights in Cambodia in the lead-up to what we
strongly hope will be free, fair and credible elections in
May next year.
The work of national institutions in individual
countries can be strengthened through subregional and
regional arrangements which provide a framework for
exchanges of views and experiences. Australia is a strong
supporter of the development of such arrangements in the
Asia-Pacific region. Since an inaugural meeting in Darwin
in 1996 there has been a steady consolidation of links
among established and emerging Asia-Pacific human
rights commissions. The 1996 meeting saw the
commissions of Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and
India — later also joined by the Philippines — establish
a regional network of human rights commissions, the
Asia-Pacific Forum of National Human Rights
Institutions, with a supporting Secretariat based in and
financed by Australia.
The aim of this network is to strengthen cooperation
among national human rights institutions, including
through information sharing, staff exchanges, technical
cooperation and an annual regional meeting. It also assists
other regional Governments wishing to establish such
institutions. The most recent regional meeting has just
been held, in New Delhi. It attracted participation from
the founding human rights commissions as well as that of
Sri Lanka. Other regional countries from Asia and the
Pacific attended as observers, some of which are
considering the establishment of their own human rights
commissions.
A most effective area of United Nations operations
in this field has been the work of the Special Adviser to
the High Commissioner for Human Rights on National
Institutions, Regional Arrangements and Preventive
Strategies. The United Nations work with a number of
Governments, including in our own region, is at an
important stage. Australia was therefore pleased to
provide additional financial support this year to enable the
United Nations to continue to support national institutions.
We welcome the Secretary-General’s commitment in
his report on the work of the Organization to
strengthening cooperation on issues of democratization
and good governance. We note his comment that
“This past year has seen a dramatic increase in
activities relating to the establishment of national
institutions for the promotion and protection of
human rights.” (A/52/1, para. 30)
We are heartened by this development and by the
responsiveness of the Secretary-General. His report
clearly reflects the need I am stressing here for support
for national institution-building to be at the centre of
United Nations human rights endeavours.
Earlier this year I announced the establishment in
Australia of a Centre for Democratic Institutions. This
Centre will be devoted to the provision of practical
support for the consolidation and strengthening of
20


democratic institutions in developing countries included in
Australia’s aid programme. It exemplifies a cooperative
rather than a conflict approach towards promoting human
rights, and it will be the flagship of our good governance
initiatives. The focus of the Centre’s training programmes
will be on electoral, parliamentary, judicial and human
rights institution-building and the processes by which
broader society, notably the media and community groups,
can contribute to democratic decision-making. It will also
facilitate visits and secondments of appropriate participants,
such as Parliamentarians, senior administrators and other
influential persons to relevant Australian organizations.
While human rights remain at risk, our values are
compromised and international stability is jeopardized. The
protection of human rights to promote the dignity of the
individual is too important a matter for symbolic gestures
alone. It is only through the pursuit of practical and
effective efforts to promote human rights that we show our
real commitment to the welfare of individuals and society.
And it is vital to such practical outcomes that we orient our
approach to human rights to emphasize cooperation and the
creation of durable structures.
If I may stay briefly with the subjects of practical
outcomes and durable structures, the nations of the world
are facing today the threat of climate change and will need
to agree later this year in Kyoto on sustainable responses to
that threat. At the recent South Pacific Forum, Australia,
along with other Forum countries, acknowledged deep
concern about the impact of increasing concentrations of
greenhouse gases on rising sea levels and changing weather
patterns, especially low-lying islands. Australia, along with
others, is working hard to ensure that the Kyoto meeting
delivers a sustainable environmental outcome. We stand
ready to play our part, although, as we have made clear in
these negotiations, we have no intention of imposing upon
Australians an unfair and disproportionate cost in
addressing this global problem.
Before concluding, I should like to address the third
and final reform issue I said I would be raising. Australia
believes there is an element missing in the present
discussion on reform. I am referring to the existing electoral
group system, which dates back to the last major reform of
the group system in 1963. Since the size of the United
Nations has nearly doubled since 1963, mostly with new
nations from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, this issue needs
to be addressed again.
The present configuration contains many conspicuous
anomalies and inequities which constitute powerful
arguments for reform. The substantial disparities in the
size of the various groups and the inadequate level of
representation available to the many subregions, including
in our own geographic region of East Asia and the
Pacific, has long been an evident source of frustration.
Comparisons between the size of the African and East
European Groups — embracing 53 and 21 members,
respectively — demonstrate the legitimacy of
dissatisfaction with the status quo in this regard.
This widespread sense of under-representation is
exacerbated by the social and political diversity of the
larger groups and the limited extent to which a single
member can be said to represent the group as a whole.
While we have our own ideas, Australia does not believe
it would be helpful to prescribe any rigid formula for
reconfiguration of the group system. We acknowledge this
is a sensitive issue on which there are many views. But
I believe it is time we began to think about and discuss
this matter, as we seek to equip the United Nations for
the future.
Ultimately, reform of the United Nations means one
thing. It means a more efficient organization capable of
delivering practical outcomes to the people of the world.
If we are to achieve that reform, then we must focus on
cooperation, not conflict. We must build institutions
which will guarantee effective vigilance, and above all
else we must have the courage to abandon the ideas and
structures of the past and embrace the changes which
bring the future.




"
1888,52,1997,NZL,"﻿May I begin by
congratulating the President on his election to preside over
the General Assembly at its fifty-second session. We are in
good hands as we begin our work during what the
Secretary-General has called “the reform Assembly.”
I know, too, that my Foreign Minister, on whose
behalf I am speaking, would want to warmly congratulate
the outgoing President, Ambassador Razali Ismail of
Malaysia, on his efforts during the past 12 months. It has
been a challenging time, and he has demonstrated the
decisive leadership we all expected of him.
Two years ago, at the fiftieth anniversary of the
United Nations, world leaders undertook to give the twenty-
first century an Organization equipped, financed and
structured to serve effectively the peoples in whose name
it was established. With the year 2000 now only 27 months
away, we are still far from that goal. This is a matter of
great concern to New Zealand. We firmly believe in the
United Nations as a vehicle to a better life for the world's
citizens, and not just for those who live now. We have a
responsibility to strengthen the Organization for our
grandchildren and beyond. We must not let them and
ourselves down by allowing an unreformed United Nations
to slide into increasing irrelevance.
We do not pretend the process of reform is easy or
finite. As the Secretary-General has said, “Reform is not an
event; it is a process.” [A/51/950, para. 25] Our own in
volvement on the intergovernmental track, including co-
chairing the Working Group on the Strengthening of the
United Nations System and the Working Group on an
Agenda for Development, has given us a good appreciation
of the complexities involved in producing positive outcomes
acceptable to 185 Member States.
We know the Secretary-General faces the same
issues with his 16 July package. As with any package, it
is inevitable that some Member States will find fault with
individual elements. But we are firmly of the belief that
the package should be viewed as a whole. This will be
for the greater good of the Organization. Difficulties with
individual elements of the package should not be allowed
to unpick the overall good which is in it. We appeal to
Member States to acknowledge this reality and to give the
Secretary-General their generous support. It is small
countries like New Zealand, and developing countries,
which, as we see it, stand most to benefit from what the
Secretary-General is trying to achieve.
To reform and strengthen the United Nations
effectively, we see a need to redistribute resources away
from administration and into areas which are important
for those of us who place a high priority on the United
Nations itself. We support efficiencies, not cost-cutting.
The crucial difference between the two is that one
approach seeks simply to save money without regard to
the impact on the Organization. We cannot support this.
The United Nations is too important to us to allow such
a downgrading.
An approach based on efficiencies allows us to
reinvigorate the United Nations by reinvesting the money
saved from outdated administrative practices. This is
central to the Secretary-General's package. In particular,
the proposal for a “development dividend” channelling
resources freed by administrative efficiencies into
strengthening the development activities of the United
Nations is most welcome. We can certify from our own
national experience that the sort of management reforms
proposed in the package do indeed lead to a reduction in
administrative overheads, allowing more to be delivered
in terms of substantive programmes.
At a time when development funds are diminishing,
the significance of this step should not be lost. New
Zealand is a country that is increasing its overseas aid —
by 40 per cent since the 1992 United Nations Conference
on Environment and Development, the Rio Summit. Our
contributions through the United Nations system have also
increased by nearly 50 per cent over the last five years.
But the global trend is the opposite, particularly among
the larger traditional donors. It is becoming harder and
harder for Governments to meet their Charter commitment
to promote the economic and social advancement of all
peoples. One of the modest outcomes of the last two
years of reform efforts within the United Nations has
been the elaboration of an Agenda for Development
19


reaffirming the primacy of development, setting objectives
and recommending ways of achieving them. But, with the
best will in the world, implementing that Agenda will come
to naught in the absence of adequate funding.
The Secretary-General's reforms are designed to
deliver more for development. Equally important, they are
designed to boost confidence in the United Nations,
confidence which two weeks ago was given tangible form
by Mr. Ted Turner's billion-dollar grant to assist United
Nations agencies in key development activities. That
generous offer has given the Organization a real boost and
could be a catalyst for leveraging further private-sector
funds for development. We must support the Secretary-
General's efforts to make the United Nations the best
vehicle for delivering such assistance.
Member States need to trust the Secretary-General to
fulfil his responsibilities under the Charter: to give effect to
the policy directions which they set. We need to be clear
and realistic in the priorities we set for the United Nations.
We cannot mandate the Organization with more and more
new tasks and somehow expect these to be achieved within
current resources. And, having set the priorities, we must
resist the temptation to micro-manage. This will involve a
sea-change in the way Member States have become
accustomed to operating. The Fifth Committee still makes
decisions about staff numbers and placement within the
Secretariat, administrative decisions that in any modern
organization would be the responsibility of its managers.
We know that the transitional process of change will
not be easy for those working in the Secretariat either.
But — and we are conscious of our own experience in New
Zealand in instituting public-sector reform — the
managerial and results-based budgeting proposals in the
July package will improve work performance and will
deliver greater job satisfaction to those working for the
United Nations. The Organization's most important resource
is its people. The package recognizes the vital importance
of investment in staff. If the best and brightest are to be
attracted to and retained by the United Nations, they must
be recruited, trained, promoted and paid according to
procedures which are as good as the best employed by
Member States.
It is also important to stress here the loyalty owed to
the Secretary-General by those who work for him. He has
the right to expect their full support for his leadership and
for the initiatives he puts forward. Anything less would be
dishonourable, would subvert due process and would
potentially disenfranchise Member States. It could not be
tolerated.
I referred earlier to the intergovernmental track. It is
worth touching on the key issues of Security Council and
financial reform.
On the former, New Zealand will judge specific
proposals for enlargement of the Security Council by the
yardstick of democracy and the representativeness of the
institution as a whole. Increasing the proportion of
permanent to non-permanent members runs counter to this
principle. Nor could a package on Security Council
reform be acceptable to us without substantive proposals
opening up and modernizing the workings of the Council.
Sunshine, an American jurist once observed, is the best
disinfectant. Member States must continue to participate
in the debate in the search for a consensus solution.
On financial reform, New Zealand is strongly
concerned about the crisis facing the United Nations. It is
true that there are problems with the scales of assessments
for both the regular and the peacekeeping budgets. The
present floor has a negative impact on smaller, vulnerable
nations, such as the South Pacific island countries, New
Zealand's neighbours. This is just one example of the kind
of problem that needs to be addressed.
But those who want to see changes made to the
scale need to offer genuine inducements, not threats. We
cannot accept that any Member State is entitled to
withhold payments unilaterally or that the assessment of
those countries that will not pay their dues should be
picked up by others. All assessed contributions must be
paid in full, on time and unconditionally. It is a violation
of international legal obligations to do otherwise. This
must be regarded with the utmost seriousness by Member
States. It undermines the Organization's ability to operate.
It penalizes, through damage to the Organization, those
Member States that abide by their obligations. When the
State responsible for the largest percentage of arrears
owed to the United Nations is also the richest, and when
that State in addition attaches conditions to the payment
of only a portion of what it owes, it is understandable that
these actions should generate real scepticism in this
Assembly.
This sorry state of affairs must be resolved quickly.
But it can be resolved only on the basis of a credible
commitment that all conditions will be eliminated now
and that all payments will be made on time. And that
means in January each year.
20


I would like to raise another reform issue which has
not featured prominently in discussions to date, namely
United Nations regional groupings. It seems to us that this
is an issue that deserves examination. The groupings are in
need of revision to bring them up to date with present-day
geopolitical realities. It is anomalous, for example, that our
Pacific island neighbours, members with us of the South
Pacific Forum grouping, belong to the Asian Group while,
for historical reasons, New Zealand belongs to the Group
of Western European and Other States. The fundamental
importance we accord our membership of the institutions of
the South Pacific Forum, of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council and of the Regional Forum of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and our
relationship with ASEAN itself, should be able to be better
reflected in the regional groupings. We accordingly see
value in a reconfiguration of New York electoral groupings
to bring them more in line with those used elsewhere in the
United Nations system, where New Zealand in most cases
sits with our South Pacific partners and our East Asian
neighbours.
Developments in other regions will result in further
anomalies in the present structure. We see at a future stage
some long and complex negotiations over regional seat
allocations for a revised system of regional groups. New
Zealand of course will join with others in negotiating new
and equitable allocations of seats. While we look forward
to the outcome of that process, we realize that it will not
come overnight. In the meantime, and as a matter of high
priority, my delegation is working to forge a closer
relationship with the Asian regional group in New York.
I would like to close my statement by focusing once
more on the utmost importance of Member States' giving
positive endorsement to the Secretary-General's package at
this General Assembly, as New Zealand will be doing —
not only because it provides a positive and concrete start to
a reform process, but also because the alternative of not
supporting the Secretary-General will, in our view,
seriously undermine the credibility of the United Nations.
For two years the United Nations has been involved in
the current reform exercise. But none of us can pretend that
reform is an end in itself, or that introspection is an
ongoing excuse for inaction. The United Nations exists to
deliver concrete, substantive assistance to the hundreds of
millions most in need. No amount of self-analysis is a
substitute for that. Moreover, sustained emphasis on
introspection will erode the Organization's capacity, and
possibly also its will, to perform the tasks for which it was
created.
The challenge now is to embrace the bold
programme of reform outlined by the Secretary-General,
to use this General Assembly to begin to implement it,
and then to direct our energy where it rightly belongs, to
taking practical steps to reduce suffering and build a
better and more peaceful world: like drawing up a solid,
practical programme for alleviating poverty in the coming
decade; like establishing an international criminal court
which will ensure that individuals are held responsible for
war crimes; like supporting and enhancing the United
Nations capability for preventive diplomacy; and like
invigorating the United Nations capacity for
peacekeeping.
These are the standards by which the real success or
failure of the United Nations will be judged. New Zealand
is determined that the verdict will be a positive one.
Working together, we can ensure that it is.





"
1949,33,1978,PNG,"﻿
189.	Mr. President, I wish to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office you now occupy. My delegation is confident that under your able leadership and guidance this thirty-third session of the General Assembly will be a successful and fruitful one. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Mojsov of Yugoslavia, on the efficient manner in which he performed his duties during the last session of the General Assembly .
190.	Year after year we gather here in order to express our concerns over the issues facing our world today. These issues are so numerous that one could not possibly discuss all of them in this world forum at one time, let alone find
solutions to them. Therefore, I propose to highlight only those issues which my delegation considers are in urgent need of positive action by this world body. These issues are human rights; the situations in southern Africa and in the Middle East; decolonization; disarmament; and the new international economic order.
191.	The question of human rights, being an important issue, has occupied a central position for my Government and indeed for many other Governments represented here today. It is particularly pleasing to my delegation to note that in some countries adequate measures have been taken to restore basic human rights. However, in others there still exist inhuman practices and an appalling denial of the human rights of people living there. It is the hope of my Government that the international community will condemn those who insist on perpetrating these activities.
192.	We note that this year the international community will be celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This will provide us with a unique opportunity for assessing the records of the United Nations and the international community in the human rights field. My Government hopes that each Member of the United Nations will do the same.
193.	My delegation is pleased to note that there has been progress1 on the question of Namibia. We understand the people of Namibia will attain their independence in December this year. Papua New Guinea will not accept anything less than that. The United Nations should be proud of itself for not letting up on the racist regime of Vorster. We hope the free elections will ensure equal participation in the running of that new nation. We shall certainly be looking forward to seeing Namibia among us in a very short time.
194.	I turn now to the question of Zimbabwe. In view of the mounting unrest and violence in Zimbabwe, my Government is convinced that there can be no acceptable solution until majority rule is established in accordance with the principle of 'one man, one vote'. Unilateral action will not bring about a lasting solution; it will only make the situation worse. Initiatives taken by the front-line States together with the United Kingdom and the United States have be helpful.
195.	In relation to apartheid, institutional racial discrimination in South Africa still causes concern to my Government. We have stated in the past and will state once again here and now, in the strongest terms, that the policy of apartheid in southern Africa is abhorrent. There is no indication whatsoever that the racist Government of South Africa is moving away from its policy of separated races. Opponents of apartheid are victimized; African leaders and organizations are banned; basic human rights are denied to fee black African people. We know, too, that leaders such as Steven Siko have been gaoled and murdered by the racist regime. How long will these inhuman acts go on? The time bomb is ticking. Unless we defuse this bomb, it is going to explode.
196.	The situation in the Middle East causes grave concern, not only to those who live in the region but also to all peace-loving peoples of the world. My delegation
supports 'the efforts being made by Egypt and Israel towards a workable solution in that region. We understand the issue is a very complicated one, and a solution will not come overnight. However, we do believe that there should be some compromises and concessions. Papua New Guinea has always remained neutral on this question because deep in our hearts we sincerely want to see peace and security in that region. We hope that what has been achieved at Camp David will give impetus to the process of peace in the Middle East.
197.	Papua New Guinea is an ardent supporter of decolonization. My Government has, therefore, earlier welcomed with great pleasure our nearest neighbour, Solomon Islands, to this Organization of nations. I am particularly happy to see representatives of that country take their seats here. I am also happy to say that another island territory in the South Pacific, namely, Tuvalu, will become independent on 1 October this year. The Gilbert Islands expects to achieve its independence next year. In the years to come other small island countries in the Pacific will achieve self-determination.
198.	My Government welcomes the progress of decolonization that is taking place in the South Pacific and looks forward to the day when the remaining Territories under colonial administration become independent. Some colonial Powers represented here today have seen fit not to give people under their colonial rule the chance to express their views in line with the various United Nations resolutions on decolonization. As a country in that region, Papua New Guinea hopes that these metropolitan Powers will change their attitudes towards decolonization in the South Pacific and will ensure that the people in those Territories under their administration will be given the opportunity to exercise their rights to self-determination and independence. With that in mind, my delegation endorses the statement made at the previous meeting by Mr. Owen, the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, concerning Tuvalu, the Gilbert Islands and the Anglo-French condominium of the New Hebrides.
199.	It is my Government's sincere desire that these Pacific neighbours of Papua New Guinea should attain the status of full independence, as this will greatly increase the number of sovereign nations in the South Pacific region.
200.	On the question of disarmament, my Government is deeply concerned at the fact that the arms race consumes some of the most precious resources which we believe could be better used in the social and economic development of mankind.
201.	Man has always sought a peaceful existence within secure boundaries; in order to achieve this, he has always had arms. However, man has, through the arms build-up, particularly that of nuclear weapons, created a situation where he is no longer secure. Each State now seeks to have more advanced and sophisticated weapons in case of attack by others. As we all know, this process is threatening the existence of mankind.
202.	The time has come for this world body to act positively towards reversing this dangerous trend. We should call a halt to the arms race immediately. We agree
with those who say that political will is needed to achieve real disarmament. However, we also say that a certain amount of trust and perhaps faith in each other is needed in our endeavours towards the achievement of this complicated task.
203 Ending the arms race and achieving real disarmament are very important and urgent tasks facing us today. The desire of a small nation such as mine is for the peoples of this world to have peace and security. This could then leave us free to concentrate our efforts on bettering the lives of our people-that is, eradicating disease, improving standards of living and providing enough food for the starving masses.
204.	Those of us in the developing world are faced with problems of not having enough resources for the development of our peoples. Needless to say, there are people starving, people in need of medical care, people in need of education, people in need of good housing. We are not saying that resources saved in the disarmament process would solve all problems; what we are saying is that it would lighten our burdens if some of those resources could be used for those purposes. This would also contribute to the realization of some of the goals of the new international economic order.
205.	There are those who argue that an end to nuclear testing would not bring about disarmament. We disagree. We are opposed to nuclear testing because, first, we strongly believe that such opposition is a step towards disarmament and, secondly, no one has been able to tell us—at least up to the present time-what are the effects of radiation on mail and his environment. The latter point concerns us most because we are situated in that part of the world—the South Pacific—where nuclear testing is taking place. There is one fact that we know for sure, and that is that man and his environment will never be the same. We have been told that radiation effects are insignificant. This we find hard to believe. We in the South Pacific have repeatedly expressed our opposition to testing in our region. However, our protests fall on deaf ears and testing still continues. We therefore call on those who are responsible for this unforgivable state of affairs to cease their irresponsible activities.
206.	The international community today recognizes the need to move quickly towards a new international economic order, even though there exist differing views on some specific aspects of the major proposals being put forward. My delegation is deeply concerned at the slow pace of the long-awaited world economic recovery. Unstable commodity trade, persistent world inflation and a chaotic international monetary system are still the order of the day. If meaningful progress is to be achieved, developed industrial nations must address themselves to the question of improved access to their markets for the goods of developing countries.
207.	It is a recognized fact that developing countries are an important market for the exports of industrialized countries. If these markets are to remain open, greater efforts must be made to enable third-world countries to increase their export earnings.
208.	Primary commodities are the mainstay of our economies. We are therefore very concerned to see the
negotiations on a common fund move forward. We are also watching with interest the developments in the commodity agreements, and we are hopeful that these negotiations will contribute to freer trade, particularly in agricultural products.
209.	The development of an international marketing system, which provides reasonable returns to primary producers in developing countries—particularly to smallholders-is of the utmost importance to the economies of the developing countries.
210.	We should also address ourselves to the question of the reform of the world monetary system as soon as possible. We support the restructuring of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system. We note that during the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly it was decided in resolution 32/174 to convene a special session of the General Assembly in 1980, at a high level, in order to assess the progress made in various forums of the United Nations system in the establishment of the new international economic order. We hope that we can then take some positive action for the promotion of the advancement of developing countries and international economic co-operation. In the meantime, we should not spare any effort to keep the dialogue going. The Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 should be used as the focal-point for keeping the North-South dialogue alive.
211.	As my Prime Minister stated in his statement at the thirty-second regular session of the General Assembly last year, the South Pacific region is often thought to consist of many small island-nations without a regional identity. This is no longer true. The region now has an identity with the coming into being of the South Pacific Forum seven years ago. This is an organization which strives to solve problems that confront our peoples in the South Pacific region and to consider various ways in which economic growth can be achieved in the region. The proper utilization of our natural resources, in particular fish, is one such way by which this goal can be reached. The South Pacific contains what may be the world's only under-utilized supply of tuna fish, and for several South Pacific nations this represents the only natural resource available. As such, it is vital to their future economic growth. It is for this reason that the South Pacific Forum is seeking to establish the South Pacific Region Fisheries Organization, which would ensure that maximum benefits from the vast stocks of tuna that live in our waters would go to the peoples of the South Pacific and not the major distant-water fishing nations.
212.	I should like to draw the attention of the United Nations to the question of East Timor. My Government recognizes East Timor as an integral part of Indonesia. I visited East Timor earlier this year and I was convinced that, during the long period when that Territory was under the previous administration, there was little or no development in the social, economic or political field. However, while acknowledging the fact that East Timor is now an integral part of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea would like to
reiterate its previous position, that is, that the people of East Timor were not allowed their right to self-determination. My Government would have also liked the international community to have had more say in the matter. We regret that this did not happen and that the international community was not properly consulted.
213.	The question of refugees has been preoccupying my country during much of the last year and is still doing so. 1 should like here and now to thank the United Nations for agreeing to give us financial support through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to help feed and provide medical care for Indonesian citizens crossing into Papua New Guinea territory. My Government is not in a position to look after everybody, as these people in the last couple of months have been coming in larger groups. This includes the last group, which numbered 700 persons. As a Member of the United Nations and acting within the spirit of the various United Nations conventions on refugees, we are committed to helping these people by utilizing our limited resources, which could more effectively be spent elsewhere.
214.	1 have briefly touched on a few of the issues which my delegation considers in need of urgent and positive action by this body. It is my delegation's hope that during this session some positive steps towards solutions will be found.

1993,33,1978,NZL,"﻿
















25.	
26.	It is my great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly and to wish you well in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities.
27.	I also extend a special welcome to the newest Member of this Assembly, Solomon Islands, whose application for membership New Zealand was privileged to sponsor. We are neighbours in the South Pacific, members together of the South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. In those settings, and now in this one, New Zealand looks forward to a close, warm and co-operative relationship with Solomon Islands.
28.	New States enter upon their nationhood today at a difficult time. As an international community we face enormous political and economic problems. If the measure of a healthy civilization is its ability to govern itself, to match its demands to its resources, to manage its technology and its institutions in a sane and rational way, then we are heading for trouble. The problems we face as a global community, as a group of 'united nations', are both menacing and daunting: issues of peace or war in many parts of the world, the crippling and dangerous arms race, the risk of nuclear catastrophe by deliberate decision or mischance, the widespread denial of human rights, food shortages, energy problems, population pressures, dwindling non-renewable resources and a whole range of economic ills, including high rates of inflation, unemployment and protectionism, low levels of investment and unstable commodity markets.
29.	It is not altogether surprising that, confronted with these awesome and intractable problems, some countries, in effect, opt out. Consciously or not, they decide to hold on to what they have, to settle for the protection and enjoyment of whatever resources they possess without too much regard for the effects of that policy on others. If, by way of regional or other association, this self-interest can be reinforced, then the wider grouping is pursued, with great emphasis on the value of regional co-operation. The motive in fact is national self-interest, and the manifestations of such groupings are high walls and barriers of one kind or another to keep the world at bay.
30.	This is not, in New Zealand's view, the way to deal with the great issues of the day. Self-indulgence and self-interest proved fatal to earlier civilizations; they may well, unchecked, be fatal to ours. The international community, of which the United Nations is the symbol, cannot survive let alone prosper if we, the members of it, withdraw into our shells. The agenda of international problems, however frightening, needs to be addressed by all of us squarely and determine and, mindful of course of our responsibility for the security and welfare of our own people but mindful also of the needs of the global community. We need, in short, fewer barriers between us, better machinery for consultation in the economic, social and political spheres, and above all the political will to engage in the sort of co-operation which allows us at least to make a start towards correcting the gross social and economic injustices that now prevail.
31.	This is not simply an economic issue. If we are to move in a discernible way to cure current ills the issues of national security, of international law, of intergovernmental organization—all the major political issues of the day—are of paramount importance. Solutions to those problems will determine the freedom of States to make the appropriate responses in the economic sphere. Nor is it, as I have pointed out, the concern of just a few States; the problem is an immediate one for all pf us.
32.	The great Powers, however, have a primary role. Their attitudes to each other condition the environment in which we all live and operate. What the great Powers do, and what they do not do, carry consequences for all of us. We welcome therefore those co-operative arrangements that betoken an effort to contain crises, to co-operate in the avoidance of nuclear war, to reach agreement on arms- control measures, to extend relations over a broad range of social and cultural fronts and to reduce the harshness of the rhetoric between them.
33.	It is not, of course, only up to the great Powers. International relations are both intricate and complex and there are opportunities for constructive contributions from the small and middle-sized Powers as well as from the great.
34.	These opportunities would be immeasurably enhanced if the smaller States learned to work together. In New Zealand's part of the world, the south Pacific, we are making an effort to do so and we are attempting to build up a sense of partnership in the region. I have just come to
New York from a meeting earlier this month of the South Pacific Forum-a regular conference of the Heads of Government of all the independent and self-governing States of the south Pacific. Among the major topics discussed at the Forum was the enactment of legislation creating a 200-mile exclusive economic zone by the countries of the region. This offers to many of these smaller island States an opportunity, for the first time, to capitalize on what is in some cases their only substantial resource. These Pacific island States, together with New Zealand and Australia, have decided to move at once to set up a Forum fisheries agency to advise their Governments, many of whose scientific resources are slender, on the conservation, utilization and management of the living resources, including highly migratory species, of their 200-mile economic zones. At the same time, they are continuing to explore the question of what kind of long-term regional fisheries arrangements will serve the Pacific best.
35.	Another major topic discussed at the Forum was economic development and ways of minimizing the twin evils of protectionism and declining terms of trade. We suffer from these in New Zealand and we understand the difficulties facing developing countries and in particular our south Pacific neighbours, most of whom have an even narrower range of export products and less stable markets than we do. To tackle these problems we have together established an industrial development scheme to provide financial backing and incentives for companies to develop manufacturing industries in the islands. In addition, we are currently reviewing the numerous factors affecting entry of island exports to the New Zealand market. Our bilateral aid programme continues to have its primary focus in the south Pacific and this year 60 per cent of New Zealand's bilateral aid will be directed to the region. In the fields of shipping and civil aviation substantial progress has been made. A regional shipping line started operations in May and the number of direct air services between countries of the region is increasing.
36.	These are practical issues-a serious effort on the part of all the regional States to stimulate new thinking and to create greater opportunities for the development of trade and economic advancement in our part of the world. Their purpose, however, goes beyond mere economic considerations. Solutions are vital if democratic processes and political stability are not to be placed in jeopardy.
37.	In New Zealand's view, the same sort of co-operative effort—and for the same reasons—is needed in the global arena. As I see it, the world's economy today is distinguished by two rather paradoxical characteristics-its interdependence and its diversity. We have to grapple with both. Take interdependence. I do not question the argument for individual countries fostering a degree of economic self- sufficiency. There are certain skills and certain industries which every country needs to have even when the cost of establishing those skills is, by international standards, high. I believe, however, that most countries, including my own, have far snore to gain from participating in the international economy than from standing outside it. Decisions made in the world's major trading nations have a critical effect on the economic well-being and on the development patterns of the more peripheral economies. In the reverse aspect, recent years have shown that the world's major trading
countries also depend, to varying degrees, upon economic events in the less economically powerful countries. Raw material supply is an obvious area. Another is the importance of some developing countries as sources of demand and as areas of investment for the products and capital of the richer nations. There is evidence stretching back over a long period of the economic benefits for richer countries of increasing their imports, particularly of labour-intensive goods, from the newly industrializing countries. For these countries political stability is inseparable from economic stability.
38.	If countries are to produce and export those things which their human and material resources and their historic development priorities suggest as logical and economically efficient, they must do so within an international economic environment that allows scope for their diversity. That means an open international trading system. Protectionism must be resisted, especially in the area of agricultural commodity, trade, where there is a dangerous disposition among the richer developed countries to apply more restrictive policies than in the industrial commodity area. I recognize that the principles of an open multilateral trading system raise difficult domestic political problems, but economic development is about change and innovation and we need to look at today's problems with our eyes very firmly fixed on the longer term. These wider principles are very much at stake in the current series of the GATT negotiations. Only to the extent they are recognized, and acted upon, will the Tokyo round of negotiations be judged successful.
39.	The maintenance of an international trading system is not, by itself, enough. An international economy to which all countries and all people are contributing to the maximum extent possible needs to take account of the diversity of the international economy in another sense too. We need to recognize that there are very different kinds of economies. I do not mean that we should endeavour to come up with a new and sophisticated classification; rather that we should recognize, in the interests of the international economy, as well as in the interests of peace and justice, that some countries will need special assistance on a long-term basis, the world's poorest nations will need special aid and trade measures; so might the land-locked countries and the developing island countries. The aid and trade policies of some. countries, including my own, are already taking account of these special requirements, and the more advanced developing countries are following suit. Technical co-operation among developing countries, a concept which the United .Nations had done much to promote, has in this last month been the subject of a world conference in Buenos Aires.  It is a most welcome development and one which exemplifies the sort of practical co-operation I have been advocating.
40.	This sense of community, of co-operative partnership, of working together to discuss and solve problems, not only must underpin our aid and trade initiatives; it must be demonstrated also in our- treatment of political problems if our systems and institutions are not to become irrelevant.
There are few people in the world who do not wish for peace. There are even fewer who believe that peace can be secured other than through the co-operation and partnership l the people concerned themselves. Enforced solutions rarely endure. The only sure foundation for the peaceful settlement of disputes is the will of the parties involved to work for reconciliation and peaceful co-operation.
41.	This is surely the lesson of what is now happening in the Middle East New Zealand has no special knowledge of the Middle East question nor would we presume to offer an answer to the tangled web of issues at stake. But it does seem to us that certain fundamental principles need to be accepted if the will to reconcile and co-operate, which has been demonstrated in a dramatic way by the leaders of Egypt and Israel over the past year, is to be turned into a fair and lasting peace. Above all, we believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the essential elements which should form the basis for a negotiated settlement. But just as our support for Israel's right to exist as a sovereign State within secure and recognized boundaries is fundamental to our approach to the dispute, so we are convinced that the rights of the Palestinians, including the right to self-determination and to establish an independent Palestinian State if they so desire, must be recognized. It is clear that a settlement which meets these -two criteria requires that Israel withdraw from areas occupied in 1967, so as to permit the Palestinians full freedom to exercise their right of self-determination. A Middle East settlement would not only confer inestimable benefits on Israel and its Arab neighbours, but would remove a potential and ever-real danger to world peace. We have therefore been tremendously encouraged by the will for peace and reconciliation displayed at the recent Camp David summit meetings. Early progress in pursuit of the agreements reached at Camp David by the leaders of Egypt and Israel, with the active partnership of the United States, must be our common hope in this Assembly.
42.	It is true also that these lessons of co-operation have still to be learned in southern Africa. The history of relationships between black and white in that continent, between those who exercise power and those who, though in an overwhelming majority, have had no say in their destiny, is one - of so many opportunities lost to work together in harmony and co operation. In Namibia recently, it is true, there has been encouraging progress towards independence as a result of the persistent efforts of the five Western members of the Security Council and the front-line African States. It would be tragic if progress were to be held up now by intransigence on the part of any of those involved. It is New Zealand's hope that free elections will be held at the earliest practicable date and that Namibia will soon be able to take its rightful place as a Member of this Organization. New Zealand is anxious to support this process in practical ways. Most recently my Government has contributed substantially to a Commonwealth fund for the education and training of Namibians who will soon be in a position of responsibility in their own country.
43.	In Rhodesia it is clear from the increasing scale of the armed conflict that the 'internal settlement' introduced in March of this year  has failed to produce the cease-fire that
the Salisbury regime predicted. On the contrary, there has been an escalation of violence, with innocent people as the not infrequent victims. These senseless and tragic killings must be stopped. The only way is through the speedy conclusion of a negotiated settlement. The best hope is for all the elements in Rhodesia and the Patriotic Front to come together in an all party conference on the basis of the Anglo-American proposals.  This is a course which we urge as the first step towards a cease-fire, the holding of fair and fair elections, and ultimate independence for Zimbabwe and its people.
44.	Other States, and especially the neighbouring African States, can play a constructive part in creating the climate for a settlement through mediation and diplomatic support. Or they can meddle, as some States far from Africa have chosen to do in various parts of the continent, by encouraging divisions and even by direct intervention. That is a prescription for conflict, not for settlement. We trust that the pattern we have already seen in some African countries will not be repeated elsewhere.
45.	Even after peace is established in other parts of southern Africa, the most difficult problem of all will remain in South Africa itself. It is there that a co-operative effort, even a dialogue, is most desperately needed. The institutionalized racism which is apartheid offers no hope of a peaceful future for South Africa. It must be abandoned. Change must come. There is no other way. A policy of apartheid is not only wrong; it is suicidal. It seeks to impose what cannot be imposed, to deprive people of rights and freedoms that cannot be denied. The delusion of those in power in South Africa that they can succeed in their purpose if they are tough enough and determined enough is a delusion common to Governments which refuse to listen to the voices of those they oppress. Sooner or later those voices make themselves heard and the result is both predictable and destructive. There is still time to avoid that result in South Africa, but not much. New Zealand is and always will be utterly opposed to apartheid. We want to see justice and common sense prevail. This is the oily way to prevent conflict.
46.	Our concern for human rights in southern Africa must not blind us to deprivations that occur elsewhere. New Zealand upholds the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed 30 years ago by this Genera] Assembly—among those rights: freedom of movement, the right to leave one's country and to return, the right to a nationality, the right of freedom of opinion and expression. We are concerned when these rights are denied, wherever that denial takes place, and it is shameful that, 30 years on, there are countries, including some who were founder nations of this Organization, who still deny their millions of citizens these basic human rights. How can the international community ignore that?
47.	In New Zealand this year the Human Rights Commission Act came into force, establishing a national Commission on Human Rights to deal with complaints of racial, religious or sexual discrimination, in conjunction with the
Race Relations Act of 1971. This new legislation codifies that respect for human rights which has had a central place in our traditions. We have regarded the two International Covenants on Human Rights as legal documents of substantial value and importance, and have not wished to ratify them merely on the basis of our general attachment to the principles they enunciate. We have now completed a comprehensive review of our legislation and are satisfied that our laws are in compliance with the requirements of the two International Covenants. I am pleased to announce therefore that New Zealand will ratify the International . Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide during this session of the General Assembly.
48.	I want before I close to turn very briefly to two major issues that have preoccupied the international community, and this Assembly in particular, over the past year—the law of the sea and disarmament.
49.	On 1 April of this year New Zealand brought into force its jurisdiction over a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Some 330 foreign fishing vessels from three countries are now licensed, pursuant to agreements with New Zealand, to catch fish which is surplus to the capacity of the New Zealand fishing industry. The expansion of the New Zealand industry, upon its own initiative and through joint ventures, represents a significant economic opportunity for us.
50.	I want to emphasize therefore the importance for New Zealand, and for very many of the small and middle sized countries in the Pacific and elsewhere, of a speedy and successful conclusion to th3 Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The adoption of a widely acceptable international convention will give us and many other countries a secure and stable basis upon which to plan and develop the utilization of the resources within the 200-mile zone. It is in no one's interests that the oceans should become a battleground for competing claims and the focus of conflicts over the extraction of resources. Both our national interest and a wider interest in the rule of law and a stable regime for the oceans lead my Government to attach great value to the achievement of a wide-ranging treaty along the lines on which the Conference is now working.
51.	In last May and June this Assembly met in its tenth special session in an attempt to stem the arms race and to begin, in a real sense, the process of disarmament. There will be differing views on the success of that session. New Zealand's view is that we have made a small beginning, that the special session has given a modest impetus to the disarmament cause and that the establishment of machinery for discussion and negotiation marks a step forward. We hope that other steps will soon follow, among them the early conclusion of a treaty putting an end to nuclear- weapon testing in all environments. Time is short, but it should still be possible, in New Zealand's view, to present this treaty to this thirty-third regular session of the General Assembly.
52.	My Government sees disarmament as among the most urgent requirements of our time. Progress has been slow.
We must do better, not by calling for far-reaching measures that have no hope of acceptance, but by working for and participating in a realistic short-term programme of action which will result in agreements that are balanced, practicable and verifiable. Between now and the next special session, New Zealand will support each and every measure of disarmament that meets these criteria.
53.	The world is an increasingly complex place. Within our own societies, and in our international life, there are forces at work that are changing our perceptions, altering our values and demolishing our traditions at a bewildering pace. There are many competing interests to be accommodated, conflicting philosophies and approaches to be reconciled. We can accommodate and reconcile them only by being honest, understanding, straightforward and fair with each other-not only with our friends, for that is relatively easy, but more importantly with those with whom we may disagree. If we can work towards this sense of co-operation and partnership as a world community we can, I believe, if not solve all our problems at least reduce them to a manageable dimension. For its part my Government pledges itself to work with others in this spirit and to this end.
"
1997,33,1978,AUS,"﻿4.	This has been an exceptionally active year, with three special sessions of the General Assembly, a heavy calendar of conferences and an increasing range of activities conducted by the specialized agencies. For the successful management of the special sessions and the related consultations, I should like to pay a particular tribute to our former President for his competence and to express the gratitude of my delegation for his achievement.
5.	The increased activity in which our Organization has been involved is a clear indication of the quickening tempo of international events and of the role of the United Nations as a focal-point for the negotiation of issues arising from the rapidly changing international environment.
6.	It is important that the United Nations should demonstrate a capacity to respond to these pressures. As the Secretary-General has said in his report on the work of the
Organization [A/33/1], the willingness of Governments to involve the United Nations in major issues depends on their confidence in its objectivity and capacity for impartial action.
7.	Relations among Member States have become increasingly complex and diverse. National prosperity and stability depend on a high level of exchange and contact between countries. No nation or group of nations can progress in isolation from the rest of the world community. The United Nations can provide the framework and the procedures which will permit the more orderly management of this increasingly interdependent world. The United Nations can ease the adjustments that the emergence of a global society requires.
8.	Our Secretary-General, in his report on the work of the Organization over the past year, drew attention to some of the factors which limit the ability of the United Nations to act as the guarantor of justice and peace for all nations. At the same time, the Secretary-General was able to point to other instances where the Organization is indeed playing a highly constructive role.
9.	The great issues confronting the world community might best be summed up as how we meet the challenge of a rapidly changing world situation. Change, of course, is a characteristic of any period, but it has rarely posed more serious decisions for the world community than those which are now before us. Change inevitably disrupts existing balances and established attitudes. It may be evolutionary or radical; its results may be a new era of peace or a major disaster for mankind. Too much is at stake for the representatives of the world community to stand aside and permit the future to emerge as a product of uncontrolled and unpredicted forces. There is an urgent need for us to reconcile competing interests, and we should not be distracted from our task by mere rhetoric or invective.
10.	On many issues progress will only be achieved if we work for consensus and harmonize the interests of the major groups of nations. This is the only way to arrive at practical and durable solutions. The United Nations must, of course, do more than simply provide the forum for debate on the great international issues. It must provide leadership and it must provide guidance to Member States. It is only if we can demonstrate new will and intent in the Organization that we shall build the confidence of which the Secretary-General has spoken.
11.	The preservation of international peace and security remains a major preoccupation. We address aspects of this question in the efforts of the United Nations to promote 
arms control and disarmament, to reduce international tension and to provide peace-keeping arrangements.
12.	Arms control and disarmament were considered in detail at a most important special session this year, the tenth. While the session was not intended to produce specific agreements it did result in some notable achievements. For the first time there was international agreement about priorities and objectives in the disarmament field. As a result of the session new momentum for progress in disarmament will develop. An agenda of measures has been agreed upon. And the international community will devote a significantly greater amount of time to disarmament issues over the next few years.
13.	Despite these achievements we need to be realistic. Progress towards arms control and disarmament will require a commitment by States to the development of practical measures. Fundamental issues of national security, international confidence and survival are involved. We must recognize and seek to reconcile the important differences of approach and objectives. We must also be aware that competitive arms programmes may be as much an effect as a cause—beyond a certain point, arms control can only progress if underlying international tensions are reduced.
14.	Australia continues to believe that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks offer the best prospects for substantial measures of arms control between the super-Powers and ultimately among all nuclear-weapon States. We welcome the announcement that the conclusion of the second series of the Talks by the end of the year is possible. We were pleased, too, to see that the Final Document of the special session [resolution S-10/2] reflected a proposal, advanced by Australia and other countries, for a halt to the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons purposes as one means of scaling down the arms race. It remains our view that this measure merits early action in future negotiations on the limitation of existing nuclear arsenals.
15.	The decision of the special session to reaffirm the urgent need for a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty [ibid., sect III, para. 51] is consistent with Australia's long-held view. Such a treaty would be a barrier both to the expansion of existing nuclear arsenals and to the further spread of nuclear weapons. At this session we will continue our efforts to promote international support for the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban.
16- It was agreed at the special session that the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons was a matter of universal concern requiring undertakings by all States, and that international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be under effective safeguards [ibid., sect. II, para. 36]. Australia would have preferred to see more explicit recognition in the Final Document that the right of all nations to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes carries with it a reciprocal, obligation—indeed, a binding commitment—not to develop or acquire nuclear weapons. We believe, nevertheless, that the consensus reached provides a firm basis for the further development and elaboration of non-proliferation measures in the appropriate international bodies.

17.	An important immediate result of the session was the undertaking by three of the nuclear-weapon Powers about the strictly limited circumstances in which they would contemplate using nuclear weapons. Australia was one of those countries which had been calling for strengthened assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons for non-nuclear-weapon States which had themselves renounced the acquisition of nuclear weapons. We welcome the unilateral assurances provided by the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, which will do much to satisfy the concerns of non-nuclear-weapon States.
18.	The special session also agreed on important improvements in international disarmament machinery. A wider and more representative group of countries will now be able to participate directly in discussions and negotiations on arms control and disarmament. Australia is glad to have the opportunity to join in the important work of the Committee on Disarmament and we will make an active and constructive contribution. We do not underestimate the task of the Committee; its time and resources are not unlimited. If it is to meet the expectations of the international community it will need to concentrate initially on practical and concrete issues where progress can be expected. Urgent consideration should be given to the conclusion of international agreements prohibiting the testing of nuclear weapons in all environments and prohibiting the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The achievement of early but worth-while results will do much to win the Committee the confidence and support of the world community.
19.	There will still be an important, indeed essential, role for bilateral negotiations on disarmament questions, particularly between the super-Powers. Regional arms control arrangements can also be helpful. However, the Committee on Disarmament should be seen as the principal multilateral negotiating body on arms control and disarmament questions. It should be the means of achieving the long-term objectives of the world community in arms control and disarmament negotiations. This is a matter in which a global approach is absolutely necessary.
20.	Through its tried and established peace-keeping machinery the United Nations has made a unique contribution to preserving international peace and security. Peace-keeping is a sensitive and difficult process, and the machinery which has been forged over the years has become an essential instrument of the Security Council in fulfilling its obligations. This machinery, which depends also on the key role of the Secretary-General and the active support of the General Assembly, is an encouraging example of how the United Nations can respond constructively to the concerns of the international community. My Government has given continuing support to United Nations peace-keeping operations, in men, materials and money, over many years.
21.	We welcomed the establishment of UNIFIL and the recent renewal of its mandate in a very complex and dangerous situation. We believe it should be maintained until effective Government control can be restored in the areas of its responsibility. UNIFIL's mandate does not of course extend to Beirut and northern Lebanon, where continuing conflicts have caused heavy casualties and human suffering, which my Government deplores.
22.	United Nations peace-keeping operations can only be as effective as the parties to a dispute will permit. To be successful in the long term, they must be accompanied by intense efforts to resolve the underlying causes of the conflict. Peace-keeping is not an alternative, but an important contribution, to the negotiation and settlement of disputes. There is a responsibility on the parties to a dispute to work actively to resolve their differences and to remove the need for the continuing presence of United Nations forces. The peace-keeping role is intended to promote solutions, not to perpetuate disputes.
23.	The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus is of long standing, as is the question of Cyprus on our agenda. It is our hope that renewed consideration of the question of Cyprus by the General Assembly this year will lead to more urgent and productive negotiations in the intercommunal talks, in which we continue to place reliance.
24.	In a similar spirit we approach the consideration of two key areas of> international tension: I refer to southern Africa and the Middle East.
25.	As far as southern Africa is concerned, every avenue must be pursued for the peaceful achievement of just and lasting solutions in southern Africa.
26.	Australia has followed with close interest and sympathy the negotiations for a settlement which would bring independence to the people of Namibia. We applaud the efforts made by the five Western members of the Security Council and the positive response of the front-line States in the common search for a just and peaceful settlement of the problem, which is the collective responsibility of the United Nations. Australia has a close understanding of the issues involved from its former membership in the Security Council and its present membership in the United Nations Council for Namibia.
27.	We are encouraged that the Security Council, with the clear concurrence of the South West Africa People's Organization, has now adopted resolution 435 (1978) and has thereby approved the report of the Secretary-General and his explanatory statement. The Security Council has been obliged to act in the face of South African defiance of the will of the world community. For South Africa to reject this eleventh-hour chance for a peaceful settlement would be a historic disservice to all concerned and not least to its own people, and we would deplore it. We look to the new Government of South Africa to reconsider its position and to co-operate fully and faithfully with the Secretary- General in implementing the plan for a settlement.
28.	We will continue to support efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement in Zimbabwe which provides for majority rule and independence. We believe that the Anglo-American proposals on Zimbabwe1 still provide the best available basis for such a settlement, and we see no alternative to the convening of an early meeting of all parties to discuss them.
29.	Australia's position on the question of apartheid is clearly and firmly on record. We oppose and condemn a system which so grossly violates the basic rights of the black majority in South Africa. While some modifications have been introduced by the South African Government, it is quite clear that they do not represent a fundamental change of policy. Unless such a change occurs increasing violence appears inevitable.
30.	The Government of South Africa must make fundamental changes. It must renounce the system of apartheid. It must cease to harass and humiliate the majority of its people. We are approaching a point where the possibility of conciliation and compromise will be lost.
31.	Recent developments in the Middle East have given us some hope that conflict will be avoided. The Australian Government welcomes the two agreements signed following the Camp David meetings  as a constructive framework for progress. In particular, the Australian Government welcomes agreement that further negotiations will be guided by the provisions and principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.
32.	These positions accord with Australia's views. The Australian Government pays a tribute to the statesmanship of the leaders of Egypt and Israel in reaching these agreements and applauds the initiative and the assiduous efforts of the President of the United States in fostering them.
33.	We recognize that long and difficult negotiations will be required if there is to be a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is our earnest hope that other Arab States, whose support will be essential to any lasting settlement, will be encouraged to accept the Camp David framework as a basis for future negotiations and will be prepared to join in the search for peace. For its part, the Australian Government stands ready to lend its support to any settlement agreed between the parties in the Middle East.
34.	Member States at this session of the General Assembly should in our view be careful to avoid any action which could have the effect of prejudicing the prospects for peace which these agreements offer. The momentum generated by the Camp David agreements should be maintained. This will require a favourable climate for intense diplomatic activity, and we should not disrupt this process.
35.	In my address to the thirty-second session of the General Assembly  I drew attention to the dilemma Governments face in weighing commitment to human rights against other critically important concerns, including commitments to international peace and order and to national cohesion. Events during the past year have illustrated the difficulty—to which I referred at that time—of protecting the rights of individuals while also working for progress in detente. The international community is being brought to 460
accept the fact that in cases such as this the pursuit of one objective should not exclude the other.
36.	The reconciliation of what is principled with what is practical has never been easy. Bilateral and international responses to human rights situations must evolve over time, and responsible experimentation will be required. As a starting-point, the United Nations must uphold the provisions of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The United Nations must inspire confidence that it is prepared to promote basic human rights' and provide the framework for responsible action by Governments in situations where difficult choices may well have to be faced.
37.	Action by the United Nations should, of course, promote and not prejudice the observance of human rights. We must always bear in mind that the objective is not to strike attitudes but to improve the conditions of individual men and women, Care must be taken to avoid tackling situations in such a manner as to place at risk other valid objectives of the world community. Private persuasion can be most effective. The unobtrusive work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights provides a very good example.
38 As States Members of the United Nations we-must continue our search for means and mechanisms effectively to promote and effectively to protect human rights. Australia welcomed the adoption by this Assembly last year of resolution 32/130. We believe that there is a growing public expectation that the United Nations should be able candidly to consider situations where gross breaches of human rights appear to have occurred. The United Nations must also be seen to stand firm on the rights of the individual within the context of agreed international instruments.
39.	The international community must have confidence that the Organization can provide workable multilateral procedures equally applicable to all and equally available to all. The United Nations should act, in the human rights area, without over-rigid adherence to restrictive interpretations of Article 2, paragraph 7, of the Charter. If it could be established that the purpose of such multilateral procedures was to consult and not simply to condemn, to work for improvement, not for impeachment, then a great step would have been taken in achieving a principal objective of the Organization.
40.	The visit of a working group to Chile  has established a most important precedent and represents an approach which might be repeated and refined in other cases. We could also seek alternative means of enlisting the co-operation of States where human rights situations appear to require Investigation. We might seek to enlarge upon the method of self-criticism and self-reporting inherent in the implementation procedures of the various international human rights instruments.
41.	But no matter what possibilities we pursue and what priority we give to them, we are required by recent circumstances to recognize that the United Nations must now deal with human rights issues in a fair and practical way. If it does not, we shall see its claims to moral authority eroded year by year. We are particularly conscious of this now as we commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
42.	I wish now to turn to economic issues. It is a matter of great concern to my Government that so very little has been achieved in the negotiation of the serious international economic issues which confront us all at the present time. Although some progress has been made in the consideration of matters by UNCTAD, particularly the question of debt, and although the outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries was encouraging, the over-all situation—to put it mildly-is far from satisfactory. The difficulty of establishing a workable framework for the discussion of these issues was further highlighted by the problems surrounding the activities of the Committee Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174, also known as the Committee of the Whole.
43.	Failure to achieve substantial progress cannot be attributed only to a lack of political will. There is abundant evidence that Governments have been prepared to make broad political commitments to the search for a more just and more equitable economic order. There is now a greater understanding of the interdependence of our economies. But, while Governments have been able to make general undertakings, it has proved far more difficult to achieve agreement on specific action.
44.	The problem has, of course, been complicated by the sluggish growth of the world economy, which has left Governments with difficult economic decisions in regard to their own national economies and in responding to international problems. The slow progress is due also to the technical complexity of the issues themselves. If agreements are to be implemented and to endure, they must be carefully and thoroughly negotiated.
45.	I believe also that some of the responsibility for our lack -of success may well' lie in our approach to the North-South dialogue. The phrase itself has become hackneyed and it obscures the fact that 'dialogue' seldom takes place. One cannot have a dialogue if each country or each group of countries approaches the subject from established negotiating positions. Moreover, the simple division into North and South presumes a uniformity of view on either side which simply- does not exist. The North-South distinction has dramatized the issues, but we should recognize the variety of attitudes which exist in both the North and the South and seek solutions which take account of the interests of all countries. .
46.	The United Nations needs a forum in which a true dialogue can take place, a forum in which issues can be discussed frankly with a view to determining appropriate courses of action. The Committee of the Whole offers that chance and we hope that developments since its last meeting will enable the Committee to overcome its problems and take up early in the new year the substantive work which is on its agenda. Industrialization-is an example of the important matters on that agenda. Rapid changes in some areas of manufacturing have thrown into doubt a number of our perceptions about the development process. Technological advances have resulted in less emphasis on investment in countries with low labour costs and increasing investment m these sectors in the industrialized countries themselves.
47.	The international community just cannot allow negotiations on international economic issues to proceed at their present pace. It is altogether too slow. There must be a renewed effort by Governments to achieve results. We face a full agenda over the next 12 months, including the resumption of negotiations on the common fund, the fifth session of UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. We must make a start on the preparation of the framework for a new international development strategy, a framework which can accommodate the objectives of growth and equity.
48.	My Government believes that we must press ahead in a practical way with the discussion of the proposal for the common fund. Australia has been particularly active in seeking to make a positive contribution to the establishment of a common fund for commodities. In the long term, all nations would benefit from an institutional framework which would contribute to stability in commodity marketing. In Australia's view, the common fund would have to be financed by direct government subscription, by deposits by international commodity agreements and by borrowings from international financial markets. We consider also that the fund should have a role in financing what we term 'other measures' and we would expect the activities in this area to be directed to needs not met by other institutions.
49.	Australia attaches great importance to the round of multilateral trade negotiations, which are entering a decisive phase. Final results are proving difficult to achieve. There are grounds for concern that agricultural commodities have been neglected in the negotiations, and discriminatory safeguard measures, which could seriously disadvantage newly industrialized nations, are still under consideration. At a time of economic difficulty, when Governments come under protectionist pressures, it is all the more important that the multilateral trade negotiations should contribute to an expansion of global trade.
50.	My Government believes that adjustments in the field of energy will be among the most challenging issues facing the world community over the next few decades. The world cannot continue to rely so heavily on oil to fuel its economic growth. We must begin now to develop alternative energy sources. It would be short-sighted to regard present surpluses as anything but short-term or make them the excuse for not confronting the coming problems. We are conscious of the long lead times involved in introducing new energy technologies. International co-operation in this area is essential and must be initiated urgently. It was with these considerations in mind that Australia took a modest initiative at the last session of the Assembly in submitting a draft resolution on international energy consultations. There is still no international forum for a wide-ranging dialogue on energy.
51.	In the coming years Australia will be an increasingly important exporter of energy resources and we remain concerned to play an active part in fostering support for an international dialogue on energy. We firmly hold the view that the United Nations can provide a forum for broad- based participation in such a dialogue. My Government was pleased to note the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1978/61 that the General Assembly should give favourable consideration to convening a conference on new and renewable sources of energy. This also could assist the process of energy transition in the longer term.
52.	It would be appropriate for me to refer to some developments in our own region. I recently attended the independence celebrations of Solomon Islands. Australia was a sponsor of the application of the Solomons for membership in the United Nations, and we warmly welcome its admission to our number.
53.	Although the attention of the United Nations in the field of decolonization has focused largely on developments in Africa, we in Australia have seen the emergence of a number of new nations in the Pacific in recent years. One of the first of these was our neighbour Papua New Guinea, with which we enjoy a specially close relationship. The latest is Tuvalu, whose independence celebrations I attended last week. The Gilbert Islands are due to become independent in 1979 and the New Hebrides in 1980. Most of our newly independent neighbours have small populations and a very limited land area, but their territories are widespread and they have substantial maritime economic zones. Their accession to independence has changed the political face of the South Pacific and has given a powerful impetus to regional co-operation.
54.	Australia recognizes a special responsibility towards the new nations of the Pacific, and we shall continue our efforts to provide assistance for their development.
55.	The South Pacific traditionally has been free from political tensions. We hope that this condition will continue. As I have indicated, this is an area where regional organizations are making an important contribution to the process of change. The South Pacific Forum and the South Pacific Commission have responded to the needs of the island States in the fields of economic development, health and social welfare. The United Nations should work closely with these and other regional bodies in these fields.

56.	Regional associations can be of great value in facilitating and developing harmonious and mutually beneficial relations among neighbours. Perhaps the most important grouping of this kind in Australia's vicinity is the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], formed by five of Australia's close neighbours. The Australian Government welcomes the increasing confidence and economic growth of the members of the ASEAN, and we are working to achieve closer co-operation with them and their organization.
57.	The success of ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum in furthering the interests of their members encouraged Australia to propose that a regional dimension be added to the Commonwealth. As a result of the Commonwealth
Heads of Government regional meeting held in Sydney last February, working groups are now being set up in the fields of energy, trade, narcotics and terrorism. Their activities will supplement-not replace, but supplement—and further encourage regional co-operation.
58.	However, the region of South-East Asia is not without its problems, some of which pose considerable difficulties for Australia and its neighbours. I would join other speakers in referring to the large number of refugees from the lndo-China area. There should be no doubt about Australia's attitude. We have a long record of receiving and assisting refugees from many parts of the world. We are doing what we can to help with the present problem and by the middle of 1979 we shall have received more than 20,000 refugees from the lndo-China area alone. However, the limited nature of the international reaction to the problem has caused growing concern to Australia, its ASEAN neighbours and traditional countries of resettlement. A broader based international response is needed and we look to a wider group of Member States to do more to support the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in assisting and resettling these people.
59.	I began by referring to the accelerating activity of the United Nations. Issues long defined, and no less urgent for that, remain before us, especially those of southern Africa and disarmament. They have been given new prominence and priority this year. Others to some extent still subject to delimitation, especially in the fields of international economic relations and human rights, demand additional agenda space. We can take heart that they continue to be brought to the United Nations. We are jointly responsible for ensuring that Governments are given further incentives to make proper use of this world body.
60.	Such incentives cannot be provided without a realistic perspective of our activities in the United Nations from year to year. It is a Charter purpose that the United Nations should be a as centre for harmonizing national actions. Clearly, the present Organization is an imperfect instrument for that purpose, but the imperfections are those of its Members as well as institutional. We cannot expect to come here and find ourselves always in agreement. But we should expect to leave in greater agreement. If harmonization is to be achieved, the machinery available to us at all levels in the United Nations needs to be kept in good repair and its reputation must remain in good standing. Only the combined membership can impose quality controls on the Assembly's decision.
61.	In many areas the United Nations has succeeded in suggesting standards to be observed by all Governments and in all communities. In far fewer cases has it succeeded in setting an example by its own conduct. We can be grateful that there has been some success in the control of international crises. But the one crisis that cannot be risked is a crisis of confidence in the United Nations itself.
62.	Mr. President, in the important tasks that lie ahead your own role will be one of particular importance. On behalf of my Government, I should like to congratulate you on your election as President of this thirty-third regular sessions of the General Assembly. Your election reflects the standing of Colombia in the world community and your own valuable contribution to international affairs. You may be sure of the effort that my delegation will make to assist you in fulfilling the heavy responsibility of guiding our work to a successful conclusion.














"
2072,43,1988,AUS,"﻿
I warmly congratulate Mr. Caputo of Argentina on his election to the important post of President of this General Assembly. Our two countries share important objectives in relation to Antarctica and the liberalization of trade in agricultural products. I also acknowledge the courageous role he personally has played in the consolidation of constitutional democracy in Argentina. It is a great pleasure, therefore, to see him presiding over our deliberations at this particularly auspicious time for the United Nations. 
This year of 1988 is not only a special one for Australia, marking our bicentenary, but also for the United Nations, marking as it does the fortieth anniversary of the? Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a landmark in the struggle of the international community to guarantee individual rights for all people. Not entirely coincidentally, it is also the fortieth anniversary of the presidency of this Assembly of one of the founding fathers of the United Nations, and one of its strongest voices on behalf of the small and middle Powers, Herbert Vere Evatt, then Foreign Minister of Australia, who worked strenuously for, and announced during his presidency, the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
In preparing to address this Assembly for the first time, I turned for a little encouragement to the wisdom and writing of my distinguished Labour Government predecessor, and I was not disappointed. A very great deal that Mr. Evatt did and thought, and that was important to him, stands the test of those 40 years. Twice in his lifetime Mr. Evatt had seen the world tear itself apart. In the First World War both his brothers were killed. He had seen the League of Nations collapse into impotence and irrelevance. In the Second World War he had been Foreign Minister when Australia was in grave peril. To him, therefore# the introduction to the Charter - 'We, the people of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war' - was not just a resounding piece of rhetoric but a commitment born of despair and necessity.
Fortunately, we have all been spared a third world war since then but this period has seen, tragedy and suffering wrought on our fellow human beings by a continuous epidemic of conflicts - both regional and internal - which have blotted the world's landscape. We have seen the return of chemical weapons. War has filled the refugee camps of the world. Violence has been father to suffering poverty and homelessness, on a scale that indicts us all.
The United Nations has performed indispensable work in dealing with the tragic consequences of these conflicts  but the sad reality is that for most of the past four decades it has largely been blocked from performing the task for which it was pre-eminently created, the peaceful resolution of conflict itself. So it is with a profound sense of hope for the future that we look back over the past 18 months. From southern Africa to the Western Sahara, through the Middle East, the Mediterranean, across to Afghanistan and Cambodia, we see the United Nations, led by its Secretary-General, at last bringing to bear the collective will and commitment of the nations of the world.
The Secretary-General and the United Nations peace-keeping forces thoroughly deserve their award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The Prize is a very timely, recognition of the commitment that this Organization must continue to assert: that deep-seated and genuine differences must be resolved without blood and agony for ordinary men and women caught up in conflicts not of their own making.
In Afghanistan, despite many problems, the Geneva Agreements are holding. The Soviet Union has met the target for the withdraw of 50 per cent of its forces, and we urge that it maintain the agreed target of the complete withdrawal. Withdrawal will provide the conditions for the essential next step of allowing the people of Afghanistan to decide for themselves the form of government. The international community has a responsibility, through the United Nations, to assist in the reconstruction of that land devastated by invasion and war and to help provide for the millions of refugees it has created.
We have all greeted with immense relief the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, another extraordinary achievement of the United Nations. But we are deeply concerned that, although the fighting has stopped, there has been little apparent progress in talks between Iran and Iraq under the auspices of the Secretary-General. Australia urges both countries to bring about an enduring peace, in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987),
In southern Africa there is a distinct prospect that independence for Namibia is at hand but it is still only a prospect. As a traditional supporter of the United Nations peace-keeping activities, Australia reconfirms its willingness to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia,
Australia also fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General towards resolving the conflict in Western Sahara. In recent weeks, the most promising meetings in many years have occurred between the President of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, again under the auspices of the Secretary-General,
There have also been encouraging signs in my own region. My visit to New Caledonia three weeks ago and my discussions there with all major parties confirm that the process set in train by the Matignon and Oudinot accords not only is workable but has generated a whole new spirit of reconciliation and optimism. The process to which the Rocard Government and all the major groups in New Caledonia have committed themselves has Australia's support and that of the South Pacific Forum. We in the South Pacific share with France a determination to assist the peaceful evolution of New Caledonia to self-determination in a way which ensures that the legitimate interests of all the people of New Caledonia, including its indigenous Melanesian population, are fully protected, and their aspirations are given a chance to be realized.
Once again, after many years, Korea is on the agenda of the General Assembly - but for the first time as a single item. Australia heartily endorses the common goal of this new item peace, reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula. Australia finds encouraging the recent willingness by both South and North Korea to consider resuming dialogue. We believe there is now a real opportunity to bring to an end 35 years of confrontation.
There have also been important recent developments relating to the conflict in Cambodia. Talks are taking place among the concerned parties. The Jakarta Informal Meeting, ably presided over by Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas, realistically noted that a solution would require not only the withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces but also the prevention of the return of the genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) draft resolution this year makes that point, and we welcome that statement.
There remain, regrettably, a number of regional conflicts and tensions where there has been less progress.
Australia is especially concerned about the seemingly intractable nature of the Arab-Israeli dispute. Australia's commitment to the State of Israel is firm; it may be traced back to Mr. Evatt's time and it has not wavered since. The right of Israel to exist within secure and recognized boundaries is and must remain an indispensable condition of peace. It is from this firm basis of commitment and friendship to Israel that we say that peace and justice for Israel will be found only when there is also peace and justice for the Palestinians. 

The right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, including, if they so choose, the possibility of an independent Palestinian State, must be recognized. Israel's friends can only view with concern the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Recent events there put at stake its reputation and future as a liberal democratic State and risk increasing isolation from traditional friends and supporters, like ourselves, who place priority on respect for democratic ideals and fundamental human rights.
It is also time for the Palestinians to take historic decisions regarding their relations with Israel. The Palestine Liberation Organization must reject, unequivocally, the use of terror, accept the process of negotiation and be prepared, clearly and without equivocation, to recognize Israel; To be durable, any negotiated settlement must take account of the legitimate interests also of the Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan, Lebanon and other countries of the region.
In Burma we have witnessed tragic loss of life as the Burmese people have struggled for their political and economic rights. The Burmese people have our deepest sympathy, and I offer to them Australia's support in the period of reconstruction and reconciliation which must follow the resolution of the current crisis.
While there is much still to be done, recent events do hold out prospects for peace that only a few years ago would have been thought of as naive fantasy. Who among us two years ago - even one year ago - would have envisaged, for example, that President Reagan would be able to stand before us at this time and say that in many regional conflicts the Soviet Union had shown a 'spirit of constructive realism'? The United Nations itself has been a crucial contributor to the improved East-West atmosphere. The United Nations needs the great Powers, but the great Powers also need the United Nations. There is a wide and growing agenda of issues that cannot be resolved by the great Powers acting unilaterally or bilaterally. The great Powers, alone or together, can hamstring the United Nations; but, alone or together, they cannot by themselves make it work. An effective United Nations requires the collective will and commitment of the whole international community. It is only when this is fully accepted by everyone that the recovery of the United Nations, with all its potential, will become permanent. 
There can be few areas where this is better exemplified than disarmament and arms control. The conclusion by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the first arms-control agreement eliminating an entire class of nuclear weapons, is a truly significant development, as is the acceptance under that agreement of highly intrusive provisions for verification, which, in turn, make further agreements possible. Great progress has been made towards concluding an agreement to cut by SO per cent strategic nuclear arsenals and for all those developments Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev deserve the gratitude of us all.
But nuclear disarmament and arms control are not matters exclusively for those great Powers that currently possess nuclear weapons. For if there is nuclear conflict, it is not just the peoples of the nuclear-weapon States who will suffer. The peoples of the world will be devastated. As the potential victims of nuclear catastrophe, the peoples of all nations have the right to demand real progress and the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. They have the right to demand that the nuclear-arms race not take new forms, including its spread into outer space.
One of the few things that has given the people of the world some confidence that nuclear catastrophe will not occur is that almost all the nations of the world have undertaken not to acquire nuclear weapons. Australia considers the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which embraces that commitment, to be perhaps the single most important arms-control agreement in existence. We consider its preservation to be of paramount importance to peace and security.
We understand and have shared the frustrations many countries feel at the glacial pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament, but we do not believe that frustration is well served by bringing into question the Non-Proliferation Treaty itself. Does any nation really believe that its security or the safety of the world would be served by a world in which yet more States had nuclear weapons? Further nuclear proliferation would bring about an even more desperately dangerous world than the one we now inhabit. So we appeal once more to those countries that have not yet become parties to the Treaty to do so without delay. And, remembering - as we always must - the terms of the compact that lies behind the Non-Proliferation Treaty, in which the nuclear-weapon States undertook to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith and at an early date, we appeal once again to those existing nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the progress they have been making towards the elimination of those weapons.
The urgent conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty to prohibit all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time would be a major barrier to the further refinement of nuclear weapons, and it would be an additional obstacle to prospective proliferation. I hope the Assembly will once more resoundingly call upon the Conference on Disarmament to resume work on its nuclear-testing item.
The most immediate threat is posed by chemical weapons. The Secretary-General, after careful investigation, has found repeated use of chemical weapons in the Gulf region. We condemn such use without qualification or equivocation. We are convinced that the only solution to the increasing use and spread of these abhorrent weapons lies in the early conclusion by the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva of a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. Australia actively supports all practical measures to advance the negotiations for a convention and to prevent the further erosion of international norms against the use of chemical weapons.
In this context the proposal for an international conference on chemical weapons use, made last week in the Assembly by President Reagan, has the support of the Australian Government and, we hope, of all Member States of the United Nations. Ito give effect to that proposed we roust seek to ensure that the international conference is open to participation by all States, is convened as soon as possible this year and is attended at a very high level. The conference must have a clearly defined central purpose: a declaration that chemical weapons roust never be used and a commitment to bring into existence а universal chemical-weapons convention, as currently being negotiated in Geneva, which would rid the world of chemical weapons for all time.
One of the clear messages to come from the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament in June was that we all have a responsibility for disarmament. We cannot lay the blame for the state o£ the world only at the door of whose who possess nuclear arsenals.
The quest for greater security through higher and higher levels of conventional arms is only too well known too us all. The International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development provided ample evidence. It is a simple proposition that more arms do not equal greater security. They feed the apathy of instability and the offers of those who choose to supply arms at levels that are well beyond those needed for self-defence. The only way that peace and security will ultimately be guaranteed is by universal acceptance of the principles of common security so well articulated by the Palme Commission in 1982, the thrust of whose conclusions is that no country can guarantee its own security by threatening others and that real security is achieved, not against other countries, but with them.
While the founders of the Organization saw immediate issues of peace and security as the pre-eminent role of the United Nations, they also understood clearly that the roots of many of the world's conflicts lay in poverty, suffering and abuses of human rights. 
Australia insists that human rights know no boundaries. Human rights must always be high on the Organization's agenda. The repulsive and contemptible system of apartheid in South Africa is the most serious instance of institutionalized abuse of human rights facing us today, and we continue to urge the United Nations Security Council to adopt comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions as an effective means of bringing apartheid to a peaceful end.
In the absence of such mandatory United Nations sanctions we have worked within the Commonwealth to develop an effective pattern of economic sanctions aiming particularly the banking and financial system, as well as strategies to meet South African propaganda and to strengthen the economic security of the front-line States in meeting destabilization by South Africa.
Australia also recognizes that all countries must be answerable to the nations of the world on these issues, and we are willing ourselves to answer to the nations of the world for Australian policies and actions. Every year sees an anniversary of one kind or another, but 1988 is, as I have already said, a special one for my country. Two hundred years ago Europeans arrived to establish permanent settlement in Australia. Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, of course, were there before us. They are, in fact, celebrating at this time not their bicentenary, but their bicentennial bicentenary - some 40,000 years of habitation on Australian soil. All too many of the 200 years of European settlement have been, for our original Australians, years of discrimination, cruelty and oppression, Australians today cannot reverse that history, but not are today's Australians responsible for it. Our duty today is to acknowledge the truth of our history and to redress it.
In the past 20 years significant progress has been made. Aboriginal and Islander Australians have the same legal and civil rights as other Australians. We are taking special measures to accelerate access to services and to provide a basis for further economic, social and legal advancement. We are seeking to complete a compact or agreement with our Aboriginal people and Islanders, acknowledging their rightful place not only in the past of our ancient continent but in its present and future.
Although much has been done to improve the position of Aboriginal Australians, much remains to be done. We have undertaken to the descendants of our original inhabitants - and I repeat that undertaking to the United Nations - that we will leave undone nothing that can be done co right this great wrong of our past. ... Social prejudice and discrimination have, no place in any contemporary society and have none in my country today. Over 20 years ago bipartisan agreement was achieved within Australia to bring to an end the abhorrent but long officially sanctioned racially restrictive immigration policy. I bring here now, on behalf of my Government, the solemn undertaking, recently confirmed by resolution of both Houses of our national Parliament, that never, again shall we allow race to be used as a criterion in the exercise of our sovereign right to decide who shall enter our country. That undertaking is made hot only as a reflection of deeply held principle but also because if Australia were to do otherwise we would deserve the censure of the world. 
Australia shares with developing countries the conviction that the United Nations has a major role to play in the areas of international trade and development. We have a commitment second to none to ensuring the success of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That Round is a historic opportunity for the world to demonstrate conclusively its commitment to the multilateral trading system and to forestall the fragmentation into hostile trading blocs that damaged us all in the 1930s. The potential benefits of liberalization are great and the need is urgent. Results in key areas will be very important at the mid-term review of the Uruguay Round to be held at Montreal in December. Early results will enhance the confidence of the participants in the Round and establish a solid base for its ultimate success.
As efficient producers of agricultural commodities, Australia and its fellow members of the Cairns Group of Fair Trading Nations in Agriculture have a common Interest in promoting a more liberal trading system in agriculture. The benefits, however, can be far more widely shared. Recent research indicates that food importers would benefit from liberalization and the removal of distortions in international agricultural trade. The adoption of market-oriented agricultural policies in the industrialized countries lies at the heart of the agricultural trade reform issue.
Nor are our interests confined to agricultural trade reforms. Australia strongly supports efforts to strengthen the GATT framework, secure a broad-based liberalization of trade and extend multilateral discipline into new areas such as services and intellectual-property rights. The Uruguay Round provides an opportunity for us all to tackle these persistent and serious problems, an opportunity that might not come again soon.
The value of the United Nations is demonstrated most particularly when the Organization helps resolve problems which respect no national boundaries. One such problem is the environment, especially changes to the world's climate. Australia and our island neighbours in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have already pointed to the potentially serious consequences of the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. The very existence of a number of our fellow countries in the world is at stake. It is only by a total international commitment that we can protect ourselves, and we look to the General Assembly to give a stronger focus to international measures for dealing with this threat to our environment.
The Antarctic Treaty is a good example of international co-operation embracing environmental and disarmament concerns. It has grown from the original 12 signatories in 1959 to 38 with the accession in May of Canada. The disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty ensure that the Territory is used only for peaceful purposes. The Treaty has promoted scientific research, environmental protection and conservation, has kept the continent free from international tensions, and deserves continuing support.
This session of the General Assembly has commenced on a note of high optimism not least because of the commitment of the United States to meet its financial obligations to the United Nations and to pay its arrears. Australia has always maintained that all Member States must abide by their obligations to the Charter of the United Nations. All should pay their assessed contribution in full and on time, and Australia has always done so.
The decision of the United States to meet its financial obligations should not give rise, however, to complacency about the need for reform. Much has been done to make the United Nations more efficient since the Group of 18 Intergovernmental Experts submitted its report on reform in 1986, but there is still much to be done, especially in implementing an improved budgetary process, ordering priorities and avoiding duplication. A strong, efficient United Nations is the best guarantee that the Organization will be able to meet the new and different challenges it confronts. It is only if the United Nations is strong and efficient that continued support can be guaranteed from the parliaments and the taxpayers of its Member States, This is especially the case at a time when new peace-keeping operations are likely to place much greater burdens on us all,
Australia will not shrink from its share of that burden now that the United Nations is succeeding in its pre-eminent role of peace-maker and peace-keeper. We have contributed personnel and financial resources to the peace-keeping force in the Gulf; we have committed funds for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan; we have committed ourselves in principle to providing 300 personnel to United Nations transitional arrangements in Namibia, It is against that background - and with those credentials, I guess - that we urge the Secretariat to ensure rigorous economy in developing its peace-keeping plans.
The reform process should proceed at many levels. There is an urgent need for rationalization of the economic and social areas of the United Nations. The Secretary-General must have greater flexibility in adjusting the human resources of the Organization to meet emerging priorities such as peace-keeping, human rights, drug-control programmes and the status of women,
I began my remarks today by referring to Mr. Evatt, Lat me conclude the same way. Evatt was a towering figure in Australian life. He was one of our greatest lawyers, a judge of our High Court, Chief Justice of a State Supreme Court. He was Attorney-General; Foreign Minister and a Leader of the Opposition. He was a journalist and a writer - not always the same thing. For decades he was at the centre of political, social and economic change in our nation, often its most controversial figure. He was an ardent nationalist. 
But to this ardent nationalist nothing in his entire life's work was more important than this international Organization here in New York. For all his many achievements and titles and honours his modest grave in our national capital has inscribed on it only his name and the words 'President of the United Nations Assembly'.
Evatt described in his characteristically straightforward way what he saw as the objective of the United Nations. In 1948 he pleaded for Governments to keep faith with their peoples. They wanted, he said, 'not very much just peace and justice and decent standards of living, for themselves perhaps, but mainly for their children.'
Those words are simple and modest. They remind us that this place does not belong to the powerful or the wealthy, that it does not exist for diplomats or officials or statesmen. This Organization belongs to the ordinary men and women of our world. It was founded on a promise to those men and women that never again would their leaders bring upon them war, injustice and poverty. That promise has not to date been honoured.
We have today a second chance, a chance to fulfil that 40-year-old promise to our peoples to bring them peace, justice and a decent standard of living.
Let us get it right this time.
"
2117,43,1988,VUT,"﻿I have the honour to convey to Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina our congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We has our best wishes for success and the assurance of our full co-operation, as he presides over what promises to be one of the most historic and far-reaching sessions of the General Assembly. We also has our appreciation for the very efficient manner in which he has thus far presided over our deliberations and otherwise piloted the business of the Assembly. In this respect, he has given us a great deal to be pleased with.
It is appropriate, we believe, to gay a tribute also to Dame Ruth Nita Barrow, Permanent representative of Barbados, who was also a candidate for the presidency of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. This outstanding daughter of the Caribbean has given her country, her region, and her friends much to be proud of. It is rare for one region to present two such eminently qualified persons for the same office at the same time. In so doing this region has once again, as it did five years earlier, enhanced and encouraged the development of democratic processes within the United Nations itself. For this we commend them both and we thank the Assembly.
Mr. Caputo is known as a man who cherishes democracy. His Government is one which is committed to democratic principles and ideals and which has worked hard to nurture and consolidate the restoration of his country's democracy. Thus, under his presidency, there can never be too many reminders of the importance of fostering and encouraging democracy, particularly in international relations and within international organizations. 
To us in Vanuatu, a small island developing State, the enhancement of international democratic processes is far more than a nice-sounding slogan, an interesting theory, or a remote abstraction. We view this as an essential element of our development as an independent State. Our very survival as a nation depends on universal respect for the most basic and fundamental principles of international law, particularly respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country regardless of its size, its location, or the health of its economy.
Unfortunately, in international relations there have always been a few who occasionally forget to live by these important principles. Like small countries in every region of the world we have in recent year α become very distressed by the rapidly accelerating tendency of some larger States to forsake calm and rational dialogue as a solution to international problems. They seem to favour instead an escalating arms race, threats, and the actual use of military force.
In some instances, economic coercion and intimidation have been substituted for military force, but the results have been the same - international chaos. The chaos that has resulted may, on the surface, have appeared to be less violent than that which occurred during the two world wars earlier this century. However, to those who have been the victims of the chaos, the consequences have been as severe and as tragic as those of the two world wars. After all, how large is the world of a frightened refugee fleeing his or her home in a desperate attempt to save his or her life in southern Africa, in South-East Asia, in Central America, or in the Middle East? Therefore smaller countries# such as our own# often view with a sense of urgency the need for the international community to strengthen democratic processes and truly recognize the inherent equality of all human beings and by extension the sovereign equality of all nations - large and small, rich and poor. While we cannot comprehend are those who proclaim that all people are equal, or that all nations are equal# but who then act as if might - be it military or economic - makes some 'more equal' than others.
Thus# today, as hopes are being revived for genuine political dialogue to be a vehicle for resolving so many of the world's problems and as so many dreams of democratic freedoms are being born in so many places, we view this assemblage of nations as more relevant and potentially more dynamic than any other time in its brief history.
Like so many others, we are encouraged by the possibility that hostilities and tensions may be diminishing in so many parts of the world and that peace may finally become a reality for so many beleaguered and besieged peoples. Military conflict between the world's two great super-Powers now appears less likely for this the entire world can breathe a collective sigh of relief. The war between Iran and Iraq may finally be coming to an end. The Soviet Union is demonstrating how great a Power it is by withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan as it promised it would. 
There are also faint glimmers of hope that the long and costly conflicts in Kampuchean Western Sahara, Chad, Namibia and Central America may possibly be resolved and the people of those countries left to choose their own future, free from outside interference. Furthermore, tentative steps have been taken to lay aside old antagonisms and differences in focus, the Korean peninsula, the Balkans, the Maghreb and the Horn of Africa. Every day former rivals are discovering that there is more that unites them than that divides them.
However, we must be realistic and understand that the road to peace is still paved with a great many obstacles. In every one of the areas where there is new hope, we must understand that there is little that is certain. The process of finding workable solutions and then implementing those solutions remains fragile and extremely delicate in every one of the previously mentioned situations.
Despite what some might like us to believe, dialogue itself is never the sole answer for resolving any conflict. For dialogue to succeed there must also be a willingness to work together and to change the past antagonistic relationships and actions which led to existing contradictions and hostilities. In certain instances, circumstances dictate that there will be no rational dialogue until there has been a political struggle.
In this respect we are reminded once again of the words of Frederick Douglass, a leader of the anti-slavery movement during the nineteenth century and a great orator. As he most aptly put it,
'Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.' Had he been alive today he might very well have been examining life in South Africa under the heel of the apartheid regime, or the motivation of the Palestinian resistance, when he said: If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favour freedom, yet deprecate agitation, ate men who want ... rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.'
We might do well to recall those words during our deliberations, particularly our deliberations on those items of our agenda which relate to pleas for justice from those who have for fat too long been denied justice.
We believe that rational dialogue is the preferred way of conducting international relations and resolving disputes between nations. However, we also understand that dialogue is only possible when there is sin appreciation of its basis, and when there is common ground on which to meet.
There is not likely to be a meaningful dialogue in South Africa until the illegitimate apartheid regime recognizes the humanity of the African majority, frees from prison all those it should be negotiating with and allows others to return from exile. There is not likely to be a successful dialogue on the question of Palestine until all the interested parties are brought together at an international conference. In our own region, the question of East Timor will not be resolved until the people of that Territory are part of the process of dialogue and are allowed to choose freely for themselves who they are and what they wish to be.
Dialogue is not diatribe. The word carries within its meaning a willingness to listen and at least to understand the perspective of the partner in the dialogue. Perhaps the roost difficult notion for some to grasp is the notion that sincere dialogue does not necessarily entail claims that one party, but not the other, has seen the error of its ways and is now committed to change and to adopting the values and beliefs of its former adversary.  The largest and seemingly most intractable political problems between modern States can probably best be resolved by a convergence of views and a convergence of values. Mutual respect is the key, not domination or empty claims of triumph. As we all knew, in this nuclear age, this age of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, there are few instances in which any particular State can claim outright victory and impose its will on another.
New Caledonia is a case in point with respect to the effects of reasonableness and dialogue. During the last two General Assembly sessions, few items were as heatedly debated as the colonial status of our South Pacific neighbour. Our own relations with France, and those of our other Pacific neighbours, could not help but be affected by what we viewed as insensitivity to the legitimate aspirations of the colonized indigenous Kanak population of New Caledonia. We are pleased that today things are calmer in New Caledonia. This is due in part to the wisdom, the sensitivity and the courage of the current Government of France. It is also due to the courage and vision of New Caledonia's people and to their desire not to see their land torn further apart by civil inter-communal strife. There are still many difficult issues to be resolved in New Caledonia, but France deserves credit for changing the emotion-charged atmosphere in the Territory and taking measures to bring New Caledonia's people together in peace for a dialogue on the future.
No one can predict with certainty what lies ahead. We recall what happened more than 14 years ago when another European country, which was then a colonial Fewer in Africa, underwent a change of Government. It then put forward various proposals and options which prompted the leadership of what was then a liberation movement and is now an African Government to issue a reminder that 'there is no such thing as democratic colonialism'. Those words ring as true today as they did in 1974. 

The South Pacific Forum, the Non-Aligned Movement and the united Nations have all contributed to the current hopeful state of affairs in New Caledonia, through their consistent support for well-established principles of self-determination and decolonization. However, the candid approach of the French Government and the patience and statesmanship of New Caledonia's people have been like a breath of fresh air.
We believe that no possibility for further dialogue and peaceful evolution with regard to New Caledonia should be left unexplored. Therefore, we were encouraged by the consensus reached by the Special Committee on decolonization when it considered the question of New Caledonia in August. We hope that the General Assembly will encourage the parties to continue to work together by reaching the same consensus on the recommendations of the Committee of 24.
My Government understands and supports the principled position of the African States on the issue of dumping nuclear and industrial waste in Africa. It was not too long ago that we raised the same issue with respect to our own region. We hope that that problem will be considered in its true global perspective rather than merely on a regional basis, which could lead to other regions' becoming dumping grounds for dangerous waste materials from the industrialized countries. We also hope that the views of the countries of the South Pacific on nuclear testing in our environment will similarly be understood and supported. What is at stake in Africa is also at stake in the South Pacific.
The name of the country doing the testing or shipping the waste to be dumped is irrelevant to us. The stated purpose of the testing is also irrelevant, as is the money paid for the dumping. What matters to us is the harm being done to our waters, to our lands, to our atmosphere, to our sources of food and sustenance and to our unborn children. Please try to understand our concerns. 
It is ironic that many of the world's industrial countries became developed countries at the expense of what is now called the developing world. We, the now less-developed countries, were once forced to export cheap raw materials - and in some cases even our people, against their will - to help fuel the development of other countries. In return we were forced to accept certain manufactured goods, and agencies, in some cases even реор1ег in a reverse migration that was, again, against our will, against our own political and economic interests and ultimately against our own sovereignty.
Now, we are still exporting raw materials. Today, they are called commodities, and we have little more to say about their prices than we did yesterday. Developing countries still export people as well. Some, of course, are refugees who have been made homeless and socially marginal. Others are not refugees but instead tend to be the most capable and best trained, with skills that are in great demand in developed countries and that ace in short supply in developing countries. However, owing to adverse economic conditions, those skilled individuals usually cannot be as highly compensated or recognized in our developing countries. Often, therefore, developing countries wind up with smaller long-term returns on expenditures for higher education and advanced training. Paradoxically, we sometimes find ourselves in a sense subsidizing developed countries, which, on a proportional basis, might actually spend less on education but which are able to offer far greater financial rewards to those trained by other societies.
Developing countries also export something else, namely, capital, in the form of debt-servicing. That phenomenon has now appreciably widened the gap between have and have-not nations and created extremely dangerous social conditions in many debtor nations. It is almost incomprehensible that there is not a greater appreciation of the potential danger among the foremost decision-makers in the creditor States and financial institutions. It is also ironic that, while some were encouraged to borrow excessively, others found it almost impossible to borrow at all.
The manner in which some countries were encouraged to burden themselves with excessive debt is somewhat similar to the manner in which individuals were encouraged to acquire other well-known addictions. The habit is proving to be just as difficult to break, and the social consequences just as severe.
We offer those observations without bitterness, rancour or recrimination. We do not know of any easy solutions. However, we believe that we cannot adequately face the future without an understanding of the past. We cannot work together in finding answers until we know what questions we want answered.
The recent natural disasters that have brought death, destruction and new hardships to the peoples of Jamaica, Mexico, Bangladesh and India have shocked the world. Humanitarian assistance has been mobilized to help speed recovery.
However, we ask once again: why does the world always wait for disaster to strike before going to the aid of those who ate roost vulnerable?
The specialized agencies of the United Nations system, particularly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (PAO) do an excellent job with the resources they have at their command. Many private social and philanthropic organizations are also deeply committed and Involved in the development process. However, adverse environmental and climatic conditions, as well as the follies of mankind, are strong and persistent adversaries. They will not easily cease their assaults on the efforts to bring a better life to every corner of the globe. 
Thus, my Government joins with those who appeal greater international co-operation in United Nations development activities and disaster-relief efforts. We join with those who appeal for an end to the arms race and arms trafficking. We join with those who work relentlessly to end drug trafficking and the social devastation it brings in its wake. We applaud initiatives to study and address the serious threat posed to life on this planet by the destruction of the Earth's protective ozone layer. It appears that in the years to come no issue will be more vital to mankind's survival. The gravity of this issue is reflected in the fact that even as we meet here today more chlorine and other chemicals are being released into our atmosphere. These will cause even more depletion of the ozone shield well into the next century.
Mankind has been blessed, we believe, with a high form of intelligence and a wide range of emotions. Occasionally we utilize this blessing as if it were a curse on our fellow human beings.
We have created horrible weapons of mass destruction, ranging from large stockpiles of conventional arms to chemical and bacteriological agents and nuclear devices. Unfortunately, those who have such weapons are seldom satisfied with their mere creation and possession.
The use of these instruments of death has always been among the saddest chapters of the human experience, lb day more than ever before the international community should speak with one loud and clear voice against the manufacture, stockpiling and use of all these instruments of unholy terror. Our failure to do so can only result in greater human tragedy and irreparably rupture the thread that binds us all together.
During last year's general debate we expressed our sadness that inter-communal strife was plaguing every corner of the globe. Unfortunately, the plague seems to have worsened during the past year. Once again, it is not necessary to recite names, dates or places·, we are all painfully familiar with them. Nor do we wish to single out any particular country or region. The problem is universal. Once again we note that much of this inter-communal of ethnic strife has its roots in colonial history, during which colonialist practices often appeared to favour one ethnic group over another. However, some of today's inter-communal or ethnic conflicts either pre-date or are not at all related to colonialism. These are, rather, the result of ancient antagonisms and rivalries that all Governments should find unacceptable in the contemporary world.
While we are concerned at the growth and proliferation of these conflicts, we firmly adhere to the well-founded principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States and respect for the territorial integrity of every internationally recognized State.
We are aware that from time to time Internal and external opponents of particular Governments have incited or helped fan the flames of inter-communal or ethnic strife. However, that does not mean that we should close our eyes or our ears and pretend that the problem does not exist. This is a major problem which Is likely to become worse unless the nations of the world exercise strong moral leadership.
Many people in the world look to the United Nations for such leadership. Generally speaking, we do not fail to exercise this leadership in a responsible fashion. The general subject of inter-communal or ethnic relations is one on which we believe that the international community should exercise its moral leadership by its example. We despair when we note that no region of the world and no country anywhere is completely Immune from this problem. Even the largest and wealthiest countries in the developed world have had to face this difficult issue, and still face it today. Those that face the issue with the greatest candour will make the greatest advances in stemming ethnic fears and bettering human relations. 
For developing countries, our failure to recognize that the problem exists can only have disastrous consequences. We wish to see no society torn asunder, no country dismembered, no people displaced or disenfranchised and no Government embarrassed. We wish, rather, to encourage peoples everywhere to respect the cultures, customs and history of others. We wish to encourage greater understanding of what has divided people in the past and what can unite them in the future. We wish to see a broad international consensus appealing for an end to inter-communal strife, better inter-ethnic relations, and social progress and economic development for all peoples in every corner of the world.
Perhaps this vision of ours is a dream. However, it is a dream we are proud to possess and be possessed by. We pray that others share this dream and will be willing to join in making it a reality. What could possibly be more consistent with the ideals that have brought us together? What could possibly be more consistent with our own pronouncements on the evils of apartheid and other forms of institutionalized racism? What better way to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?
I conclude by conveying our appreciation of the efforts of the President of the last session, Mr. Peter Florin of the German Democratic Republic, and those of our Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Their dedication, their patience and their successes on our behalf have in many ways helped to make the future far brighter than it was one year ago.
The recent award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations for its peace-keeping operations is very appropriate recognition of the fact that, through his tireless efforts and with the able assistance of a Secretariat of which we should all be proud, the Secretary-General has at last succeeded in narrowly opening the door to the very long corridor to peace, justice and harmony. 
Now we, the nations of the world, must do our best to play our part by opening the door further and taking the next important step. It rests with us to cross the threshold of that door and begin the long walk down that corridor together, hand in hand.
Let us draw strength from our unity. Let us draw courage from the realization of our common fate should we fail or should we falter. Let us be nations that are, in purpose and objectives, truly united.
"
2188,43,1988,PNG,"﻿I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. My delegation shares the confidence that the members of this body have placed in you. Let me assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of the high duties entrusted to you.
May I also take this opportunity to place on record my country's appreciation of a job well done by your predecessor, Mr. Peter Florin.
I have had the honour of addressing the General Assembly on two previous occasions in my capacity as Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea: on 10 October 1975, shortly after my country gained independence, and in 1983. I sun especially honoured to be able to represent Papua New Guinea as Foreign Minister at the forty-third session of the General Assembly, an occasion which marks the fortieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
As I stated on those two previous occasions, Papua New Guinea regards the United Nations as having a special role in working for the resolution of tensions and conflicts and for building a stranger framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding.
Papua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to this objective. As in previous years, the agenda for this session of the General Assembly is a complex one. Many pressing issues remain unresolved, and many uncertainties still exist in international relations, uncertainties which have a direct impact on the development processes of a great number of developing countries, including Papua New Guinea. But despite these uncertainties, there can still be some cause for hope and optimism. It can be said with a measure of confidence that a number of positive steps have been taken in tackling problems which are the subject of this session's attention.
My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General,
Mr, Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his unwavering efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter. We also commend the comprehensive report he has presented to the Assembly. It is especially pleasing to note the progress that is being made in respect of the situations concerning Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq conflict, Namibia, Kampuchea and Cyprus.
But his report also underlines other pressing issues, including disarmament, trade, finance and human rights, where more resolute international action is required. We remain convinced of the need for a strengthened United Nations system to play a central role in promoting peace and security and more equitable economic relations between developed and developing countries.
Our own region in the South Pacific is comparatively free of major conflicts. Indeed, the region continues to enjoy peace and stability. But there are some changing trends and, unlike the past, more countries and organizations beyond the South Pacific are showing an interest in engaging actively with the region. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions and many of the worrying trends in the world economy. Our region is one where in some parts colonialism has not been brought to an end, where in other parts nuclear activities continue to be conducted, despite strong protests from Governments of South Pacific nations, and one where there are growing tendencies for big-Power rivalry.
The South Pacific community is made up of many small island States scattered in a vast expanse of ocean, which depend on only a small number of agricultural and marine products for their livelihood and export income. I am pleased to be able to say that there have also been some positive trends in the South Pacific since the last session of the General Assembly.
In New Caledonia, constructive progress has been achieved by the French administration in re-establishing dialogue between different ethnic groups in the Territory. One year ago, my predecessor drew the Assembly's attention to the presence of a large number of French security personnel stationed in New Caledonia which, among other things, served to intimidate the Kanak people in their just struggle to seek independence from Prance.
In April this year, Papua New Guinea and other island nations were outraged by the merciless killing of 16 Kanaks by French security forces and the build-up of tension in the Territory. We are pleased that the Rachard administration has now set in train a process that will bring about positive changes for the better. The framework agreement concluded in Paris in August provides a basis on which the different communities in New Caledonia can work together in a spirit of reconciliation and understanding to achieve independence. But not all causes of tension have been removed. New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Assembly, therefore, has a responsibility to continue monitoring developments in New Caledonia. We also hope that the administering Power will live up to all its responsibilities and obligations as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations.
Papua New Guinea has also closely followed developments in other Territories in the Pacific. In the case of the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands, we believe that the people of those States have expressed their wishes on their political future. Political evolution in those States has been consistent with United Nations principles and practices. Papua New Guinea has therefore established full diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. We urge other Member States of the United Nations to do the same. We hope that the way will be clear for the people of Palau and the United States Administration to resolve outstanding matters affecting Palau's political future.
Papua New Guinea is a full and active member of the South Pacific Forum, the major regional organization of the South Pacific. We continue to work with other member States of the South Pacific Forum in opposing nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear wastes in our region.
The South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Regional Environment Protection Convention are the two most important instruments established to safeguard the environment of our region. Papua New Guinea will shortly ratify both these Treaties. The decision by the Governments of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify Protocols 2 and 3 of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty is a welcome development. We urge other nuclear Powers similarly to ratify the Protocols and to respect the operation of the Treaty in the South Pacific.
At a recent meeting of Heads of Government of South Pacific nations in September it was decided to put in place а number of new arrangements to facilitate more constructive dialogue and exchanges with other countries and organizations. A Forum institutional network has been created to bring together all regional bodies operating in the South Pacific for improved co-ordination and collaboration. Regular high-level consultations between the nations of the South Pacific and interested third countries are proposed to take place each year immediately following the annual meeting of Heads of Government. These arrangements are intended to draw greater international attention to the development needs and constraints of the island nations of the South Pacific to draw attention to our resource potential and to mobilize appropriate resources to contribute to economic development, self-reliance, capacity building and the social progress of our people. The entry into force in June this year of the multilateral fisheries arrangement between the Government of the United States and the Governments of Pacific islands nations has been an important step forward not only for the development of the region's principal resource - fisheries -- but also for the expansion of economic relations in our region. Papua New Guinea would welcome similar fishing arrangements with other major fishing nations. We urge the Government of Japan to continue the dialogue with island States with a view to concluding a multilateral fishing arrangement soon.
The South Pacific region is relatively unknown among the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, and to0 many United Nations agencies. The needs of the island communities in the South Pacific are great. The South Pacific Forum has taken important initiatives to encourage other nations and organizations to contribute to the development of our region in fields where they are able to assist. Other important regional initiatives are to follow, in arrangements dealing with trade, transport and telecommunications.
Regional co-operation has been a corner-stone for the development of many United Nations programmes. We see a pressing need for many of the United Nations organs to be more sensitised and reoriented to the real needs and aspirations of the island nations of the Pacific.
Papua New Guinea's interests extend beyond the South Pacific region. We seek to strengthen our ties with the countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Our ties with ASEAN have steadily expanded in recent years. We continue to value our special observer status at the annual meetings of ASEAN foreign ministers. My Government is pleased also that the ASEAN nations have agreed to our request to be allowed to accede to the Treaty of Amity and Co-operation in South-East Asia. 
The situation in Kampuchea continues to give cause for concern. My delegation notes with guarded optimism the developments and initiatives seen in the past 12 months relating to the Kampuchean problem. The informal talks held in Jakarta, Indonesia, by all the parties concerned with the Kampuchean issue ace a welcome development. My delegation believes that the Kampuchean problem will be resolved not only by the unconditional withdrawal of Vietnamese forces but also by the prevention of the return of the genocidal policies and practices of Pol Pot and the Khmer Ruge. Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of the ASEAN group of countries to resolve this outstanding problem of our region.
The situation of the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. We appeal to the Governments of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to continue to seek ways whereby dialogue and reconciliation can prevail. My delegation notes favourably the recent initiatives contained in the July 1988 Declaration issued by the President of the Republic of Korea aimed at enhancing the prospects for reunification. We urge the Governments of both countries to reflect the wishes of their people, who earnestly hope for early reunification. My Government is of the view that the admission of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to the United Nations has the potential for opening up an additional avenue for dialogue. My Government associates itself with the growing number of Governments that wish to see North and South Korea join the United Nations.
The Iran-Iraq war represents one of the most unfortunate and saddest mobilizations of people in recent times. The unnecessarily prolonged conflict has cost so many lives and inflicted misery on so many persons. My delegation joins other delegations in welcoming the 20 August cease-fire. In that connection we commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The members of the Security Council have demonstrated the necessary political will to find an early solution to the Iran-Iraq war, and we commend them also. The leaders of Iran and Iraq owe it to their people to restore peace and harmony as soon as possible. Security Council resolution 598 (1987) provides a sound basis for the early resolution of the unfortunate conflict.
Recent events in the Middle East call for nose efforts to be made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict. My delegation believes that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland. Israel; too, has a right to exist within secure borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting solution to the problem.
The situation in Central America, especially in Nicaragua, deserves the understanding of the leaders of that region and those who are in a position to influence the outcome. We commend those leaders in that region who have demonstrated foresight and sensitivity to the problems in their midst. My delegation recognizes the value of the regional approach to the problems there.
Every year we have come to the General Assembly with expectations that some concrete measures would be taken in response to the problem of apartheid in South Africa. But, despite many resolutions by the United Nations, the problem still exists. My delegation believes that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds some prospects for success. We acknowledge that such a course of action, if adopted, could create economic hardship. But what other options are there? Economic hardship can be corrected over time, but left unattended apartheid will continue to create oppression and suffering.
Recent signs that the people of Namibia could regain their freedom and sovereignty give us some hope. Papua New Guinea urges all parties that are in a position to bring about a favourable outcome to spare no effort to facilitate progress towards Namibia's long-awaited achievement of independence. 
We in the Pacific are made up of mainly small States·, yet we are linked with the international community in many significant ways. Our environment may be less troubled than perhaps that of others, but we continue to be highly vulnerable to influences of the international environment.
Keeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and of nuclear activities is an issue to which Papua New Guinea continues to attach considerable importance. The conclusion last December by the United States and the Soviet Union of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles is an important step forward in disarmament and arms control. But more can and should be done in this area by all those who possess nuclear weapons. Like other representatives who have addressed the Assembly, we believe there is a pressing need for further steps to be taken if effective disarmament, arms reduction and arms control ate to be achieved.
As I have sought to set forth earlier, vulnerability stems also from limited opportunities to promote economic development. Papua New Guinea attaches importance to international efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism, debt-servicing and the slow-down in financial transfers to developing countries. We have taken full account of the many comments that delegations have made in relation to the role and effectiveness of the United Nations at the present time. While the Organization has not been able to deal with all problems affecting the international community, there are positive signs that the United Nations machinery has been given a chance to work. Some momentum has developed in tackling a good number of problems for which solutions have been sought for a long time. Let us not waste this opportunity.
"
2202,43,1988,NZL,"﻿Sir, I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this forty-third session of the General Assembly. I say, with the benefit of my personal acquaintance with you, that it is an honour that you truly deserve. This Assembly is in good hands as it begins to tackle the work on its agenda. 
This forty-third session of the General Assembly carries more than the usual sense of occasion. I am not alone in detecting here a feeling of purpose and o  achievement that has not always been evident in recent years. I take great satisfaction in being able to address the Assembly at a time when the standing of the United Nations is higher than it has been for some time. Even the fountain works. The mood has changed distinctly since the fortieth commemorative session, because, despite the difficulties and uncertainties it has faced, the Organization has pursued its diverse agenda while tackling a major programme of administrative reform. The record in recent times has been one of solid achievement.
The changing international climate has helped this process. In this Hall on Monday, President Reagan in his valedictory address spoke to us of his satisfaction at the movement towards a more constructive relationship between his country and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Shevardnadze pursued the same theme. In certain regions of the world there has been welcome progress in resolving conflicts that had been festering for some time„ Many of the signs are favourable.
That will be a matter of particular satisfaction to the smaller members of the international community, including my own country. We have always attached importance to the principle that the collective effort of that community should above all be applied to the task of keeping the peace. That was the central purpose of those who founded the Organization. Today it remains a goal of no less importance. Thus far 1988 has been a year of significant peacemaking, from which the world can take heart and upon which it can build. As one who stood here to address the fortieth anniversary session, I am pleased that we are now seeing renewed recognition of the value of the role and achievements of the United Nations.
Recent developments have highlighted the continuing value of this Organization's efforts in the settlement of international conflict. The accords reached on Afghanistan and the cease-fire in the devastating Gulf War required the co-operation of those directly involved. But a particular tribute must go to the dedication of the Secretary-General. The people who ate saved from further threat or have the hope of peace are indebted to his patience, skill, perseverance and unquenchable optimism. We welcome the role he has played.
There are other situations that still need the resources the United Nations can offer by way of mediation or assistance with peacemaking. Western Sahara, Namibia, Cyprus and Cambodia are all affected by unresolved conflicts. But even here the auguries are promising.
In this age regional tensions cannot be isolated from the mainstream of international life. There are dangers for all of us in conflict wherever it occurs. It follows that we share a responsibility to do all that we can to eliminate the conditions in which conflict breeds and to restore the peace if it is broken. At times the principle of collective security has commanded more support than the practice. I hope the success of current peace-keeping efforts under United Nations auspices will reinvigorate the principle of collective security and lead to its wider application.
My Government pledged last year to expand our practical contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts. I am pleased that we have been able to give effect to that undertaking. Our existing commitment to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization has been maintained. In the past month we were pleased to be able to respond to the Secretary-General's request for a contribution to the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG). A contingent of New Zealand army officers was deployed to UNIIMOG following the cease-fire. Earlier this week a Royal New Zealand Air Force Andover transport aircraft with flight crews and maintenance personnel left New Zealand to become an important national contribution to UNIIMOG's air capacity. We stand ready to assist in a practical way if, as we hope, solutions are found to other long-standing conflicts.
I have already welcomed the signing of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan. Noteworthy as they were, the Accords did not put a final end to the conflict in Afghanistan nor did they bring into being a fully representative government enjoying the confidence of the people of Afghanistan. New Zealand hopes that the withdrawal of the remaining Soviet forces will be accompanied by real progress in addressing those unresolved problems. As Mr. Shevardnadze said:
'The Geneva Accords' [should be] 'the first step in a chain reaction leading to a healthier world.' (A/43/PV.6, p. 66)
The values of tolerance and respect for the dignity and worth of human beings can be seen by us all in the current Olympic Games. They are a sign of that healthier world and we congratulate the Republic of Korea on its role as host. But it is a matter for regret that divisiveness has persisted on the Korean peninsula for so long. We look for an easing of tensions and an improvement in relations between the Koreas.
Cambodia, too, has been a tragic source of international tension for many years. That impasse has come to seem rather less intractable during 1988. In each of the past nine years, this Assembly has rightly emphasized Vietnam's violation of the Charter of the United Nations by its invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That remains a fundamental issue.
But we must insist also on a settlement there which will prevent a return to power by the Khmer Rouge. The international community was slow to accept the evidence of genocide committed by the Pol Pot Government and we have had to deal with the consequences ever since. We have a responsibility to ensure that such atrocities are never again committed against the peoples of Cambodia. 
Harrowing images of mass persecution, unfortunately not confined to a single country or continent, remain fresh in our memories as we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Much has nevertheless been achieved in the intervening years. But it cannot be denied that gross and massive abuses of human rights continue.
The problem of human rights is more and more the focus of the attention of the Members of the United Nations. All of us are bound to speak up and, if we do not, we bear a responsibility for continuing and future evils. The authority of this Organization as it deals with human rights must rest on a commitment by all to objectivity. South Africa's system of apartheid is an abuse in a category of its own. Events of the last year have shown the South African Government clinging tenaciously to its course, in spite of the international community's abhorrence of its apartheid policies.
It has so far spurned all the voices of reason and moderation. Nelson Mandela, the most respected leader in South Africa, remains incarcerated. The Sharpeville Six are still under sentence of death. The intercessions of the Security Council have been ignored. The country lives in a continuing state of emergency; it experiences increasing repression. The South African response to protests from neighbouring States is to make repeated terrorist attacks on them and to undermine their economic stability - all totally unacceptable.
New Zealand has implemented wide-ranging sanctions against South Africa. We believe that such sanctions are an effective means of changing the attitude of the white minority. New Zealand is ready to implement further measures. Our goal is non-violent progress to a non-racial, democratic and just society in South Africa.
There has been an encouraging movement recently towards peace in Angola. In Namibia, the United Nations has faced an enormous task. At last α settlement there appears tantalizingly close. We trust that Namibia's independence can be secured peacefully and soon in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). That would present a further major achievement in the work of the United Nations on decolonization.
On the initiative of the seven South Pacific member countries of the United Nations, New Caledonia was re-inscribed in 1986 on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, thus invoking a United Nations responsibility for the future of the progress of the Territory to self-determination. The tragic events at Ouvea in New Caledonia earlier this year demonstrated the consequences of ignoring United Nations principles and also the aspirations of a major communal group. New Zealand therefore welcomed the decision in June by the new Prime Minister of France and the leaders of the loyalist and independence movements in New Caledonia to move together on a plan for political development. That plan rightly takes account of the interests of all genuine New Caledonians.
That development was recognized last month by the Special Committee on Decolonization in a resolution which was adopted by consensus and has since been endorsed by the South Pacific Forum at its annual meeting last week. No one should underestimate the difficulties that may lie ahead, but everything is looking better. We look forward to a free and genuine act of self-determination in New Caledonia which is consistent with United Nations principles and leads to a settlement safeguarding the rights of all New Caledonians, including the indigenous Kanak people. 
Some argue that while the United Nations has a vital role in dealing with regional issues of the kind I have mentioned, the scope for its involvement in the balance between the super-Powers is a limited one. I do not accept that. We have seen how the super-Powers inevitably become involved in the troubles of the world's regions. Equally, issues of disarmament - including those which vitally involve the super-Powers cannot be considered as anything but questions involving all members of the international community for we are all affected, by choice or otherwise.
The issue of nuclear disarmament has taken on new urgency. Nuclear weapons technology no longer remains the exclusive preserve of the five permanent Members of the Security Council. The capacity to build a nuclear weapon is now possessed by a larger number of countries, and soon even more will have it. There are indications that some of those countries have nuclear ambitions. Whatever their motivation, such ambitions have to be curtailed.
There is a real risk here. Regional conflicts, and their tendency to attract external intervention, are dangerous enough as it is. But the prospect of nuclear weapons being deployed in such situations must now be taken into account. In that event, the dangers we would all face would be appalling.
This is an added reason why the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union to agree on further reductions in their nuclear arsenals are so important. What prospect is there of blocking the spread of nuclear weapons if these two nations cannot stop their relentless drive to develop and deploy new nuclear weaponry? In the course of last year's general debate, New Zealand applauded the United States and the Soviet Union for their decision to eliminate their land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The resulting treaty is now for the first time leading to a real reduction in the world's stock of nuclear weapons. With an agreement in the strategic arms reduction talks, the super-Powers would truly have shown the way to the other nuclear weapons States and those which have nuclear ambitions. It is not too much to hope that a corner would be turned and the threat of vertical and horizontal proliferation would no longer hang over us all. 
New Zealand believes that achieving reductions and balances in conventional forces will be central, in the search for nuclear disarmament, to the nuclear-free world seen by President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev at Reykjavik. In Europe and many other parts of the globe the accumulation of conventional forces, often without regard to actual defensive requirements, has heightened tensions and led some to look for other mote dangerous means of deterring aggression; so the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament must take place in step, and must involve all States.
Yet, at the third United Nations special session devoted to disarmament, when we had an opportunity to set up a multilateral disarmament agenda to take us up to the beginning of the next century, we could not take advantage of it. But our failure then does not mean it cannot be done. Instead we have the task now, beginning at this session of the Assembly, to pick up where the special session left off.
Rather than confess disappointment at the special session's results, or conclude that the job is too difficult, we must try all the harder to broaden the areas of international agreement. The search for consensus on the prevention of an arms race in outer space must go on. The campaign must continue unabated to convince those few remaining States which yet doubt it that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is an essential measure to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The world community must at last bring to conclusion the negotiations on a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. The Secretary-General has been called on time and time again to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use. He should never again have to issue a finding confirming such a charge. These hideous weapons must be outlawed once and for all, so that the world will never again be a horrified witness to chemical warfare. The main elements of a multilateral agreement have now been elaborated by the Conference on Disarmament. It is time to finish the job.
New Zealand has taken substantial disarmament initiatives. We are proud to have been part of the regional drive to create the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone, a significant multilateral arms-control measure.
The Treaty of Rarotonga makes a decisive contribution to the stability of the region. The majority of South Pacific Forum members have become parties to the agreement. Two of the nuclear Powers, the Soviet Union and China, have ratified the protocols to the Treaty. We look to the other nuclear Powers to do the same. The Treaty covers a wide area of the region, bordering the Latin American nuclear-weapon-free zone to the east, and the demilitarised Antarctica to the south. We support ongoing co-operation with the Latin American patties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco so that we can each benefit from our mutual experience.
For nearly 30 years the Antarctic Treaty and its associated instruments have provided the framework for effective and peaceful co-operation in Antarctica, keeping that vast area free of all military activities. The Treaty, which is open to all States, has been the basis for a unique programme of scientific research and for the adoption of measures to protect the fragile environment.
A further element was added to the treaty system with the adoption in June this year of the Convention on the regulation of Antarctic mineral resource activities. New Zealand was pleased to host the final session of the negotiation. The Convention provides a strong mechanism for protecting the Antarctic environment if mineral resource activities ever take place. It is a significant strengthening of international co-operation under the Antarctic Treaty. A peaceful Antarctica is of the highest importance for New Zealand. We look for a consensus at this session of the Assembly to preserve the Antarctic Treaty. New Zealand is strongly opposed to any efforts to undermine it.
The world economy offers us little cause for satisfaction or confidence. Trade growth is uncertain. The economic difficulties facing many developing countries seem almost intractable. Indebtedness and underdevelopment are threats to global economic stability. Much is at stake for developed and developing countries alike in the present round of multilateral trade negotiations. New Zealand calls on all member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to go to the forthcoming mid-term review in Montreal in a positive mood, determined to achieve real progress.
New Zealand places special important on achieving from the Uruguay Round a liberalization of world agricultural trade and the elimination of domestic and international policies which distort such trade. There would be no better single way of solving the menacing problems of indebtedness and underdevelopment of which I have spoken.
There have been significant moves recently towards regional free-trade areas, including an agreement between New Zealand and Australia to establish a single trans-Tasman market by 1990. It is vital, however, that the international community should continue at the same time to move along the road to an open, market-oriented, multilateral trading system. We must look for strong leadership here from the major economies, which have a special responsibility to apply, fairly and across the board, the principles of comparative advantage and fair competition. Smaller countries like my own, dependent on primary production, require the reassurance that we will not continue to be subjected unreasonably to artificial restraints on trade. 
It is a paradox that the United Nations is demonstrating renewed vitality and relevance at a time when it faces major financial uncertainties. It is unacceptable that Member States should fail to carry out their legal obligations to contribute their assessed financial dues in good time.
We must recognize, nevertheless, that constraints on available resources are likely to remain while at the same time the demands upon the Organization continue to grow. Accordingly, there is no choice but to maintain the worthwhile progress already achieved towards administrative reform; otherwise, the Organization will be incapable of meeting the critical challenges as they arise.
I speak here as the representative of the Fourth New Zealand Labour Government. The First New Zealand Labour Government, and its Prime Minister Mr. Peter Fraser, played a deeply committed role in the discussions leading to the adoption of the Charter in 1945. New Zealand's hopes of those early days have been exceeded by some of the Organization's achievements - in its economic and social work, for example, and in its human rights and decolonization activities. By contrast, our high hopes for the United Nations peace-making and disarmament roles have yet to be fully realized, but we are optimistic that the log-jam has started to move in those areas.
New Zealand continues to set high store on the work of the United Nations - particularly in its tasks of promoting world peace, preserving the global environment, combating world hunger, removing racial discrimination everywhere and creating equal opportunities for men and women throughout the world. We are determined to maintain New Zealand's strong support in the years ahead.
"
2223,65,2010,MHL,"I bring the warm greetings of 
“Yokwe” from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
 Every September since the country became a 
member of the United Nations in 1991, leaders of the 
low-lying Republic of the Marshall Islands have been 
reminding the international community of the need for 
full global action on climate change. 
 We have no mountains or high ground; we have 
only our narrow archipelago resting a metre above the 
ocean. There has been enough talk, and too much 
repetition. It is now time for meaningful action, 
creative cooperation and visible results to address 
climate change. If we fail in the short-term, the 
economic and moral costs for our low-lying islands — 
and eventually the whole world — will be beyond 
calculation. 
 The global commitment at Copenhagen to 
safeguard the most vulnerable faces a true litmus test: 
will our local communities see visible results leading 
towards a climate-resilient future? I urge that by the 
time of the climate change talks in Cancún nations 
build political trust through “fast start” finance, by 
providing transparent information and actively turning 
commitments into results. 
 We cannot wait for the uncertain path to achieve 
a full multilateral climate agreement, and we cannot 
allow laggards to set us back. Those most vulnerable 
and those willing to confront the challenges facing us 
must take leadership in this process by putting forward 
our own agreement spelling out real and ambitious 
commitments and actions to address climate change. 
And we urge others to follow. 
 To work in true partnership we must first show 
our own commitment. The Marshall Islands 
Government has endorsed a new climate change road 
map, spelling out specific actions to cut our own 
emissions by 40 per cent by 2020, and concrete 
strategies to ensure that the growth of our local 
communities is safeguarded from climate impacts. 
 The Marshall Islands has made important 
progress towards achieving several Millennium 
Development Goals, but much remains to be 
accomplished. With our international partners, we must 
also better address climate change risks in the context 
of our core development. 
  
 
10-55103 2 
 
 Practical and “shovel ready” adaptation actions 
taken now — water security, resource conservation and 
infrastructure protection — will sharply reduce the 
long-term risks to our security and sovereignty. But we 
cannot ignore such threats. It should be a matter of 
serious concern to the Secretary-General that we are 
actively contemplating risks to our territorial integrity 
and United Nations membership, that we are 
considering options to safeguard our population’s 
political rights if our land —and our thin water table — 
becomes unusable in the face of rising seas. 
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands is known to 
the United Nations as a small island developing State, 
but we are first and foremost a large ocean nation. Our 
thin atolls may appear tiny on a map, but our exclusive 
economic zone is over 2 million square kilometres. As 
Chair of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement, I address 
the United Nations on behalf of a unified political bloc 
vested in ensuring the future of the Western and 
Central Pacific, the world’s largest viable tuna fishery. 
 The development pathways of the Parties to the 
Nauru Agreement are narrow and limited, and at the 
highest levels we have committed to putting a firm stop 
to the unrestricted global harvest of our resources. The 
status quo of overfishing is unacceptable; it has 
strangled our development and threatened the viability 
of our resources. We have closed off surrounding 
pockets of international waters, and if our development 
and ecosystem needs so demand, we will close off 
more. 
 We currently realize only a tiny fraction of a 
multibillion-dollar industry — only one penny from 
each can of Pacific tuna — and we are seeking global 
support and economic partnership to grow our benefit. 
Without political and economic cooperation in regional 
fisheries decision-making, and unless fishing targets 
are in line with science, the collective economic 
development of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement 
will remain at a standstill as our coastal resources 
decline. We have already driven our partners to achieve 
positive action. However, far greater efforts are 
needed, from both United Nations agencies and 
regional fisheries management organizations, to 
identify time-bound strategies which assist us in 
realizing a greater share of benefits from our own 
resources. 
 The United Nations must make faster progress 
towards reflecting modern twenty-first-century 
dynamics. The Security Council should be restructured 
to accommodate those nations whose size, leadership 
and responsibility — in particular, the Group of Four 
of Japan, Germany, India and Brazil — indicate a 
deserved role as permanent members. Further efforts 
should also ensure that Africa and small nations, 
including island States, have an improved voice. 
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes 
the progress achieved on both sides of the Taiwan 
Straits. The pragmatic and moderate actions of Taiwan 
should not be overlooked by the United Nations, and 
deserve further encouragement. I call upon the United 
Nations system and Member States to be open-minded 
and identify appropriate means to accept Taiwan’s 
participation within specialized agencies, including the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, and in the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. In particular, recognizing the commitment to 
reduce emissions by the 23 million people of 
Taiwan — a fellow island nation — in addressing 
climate change is in the common interest of us all. 
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes 
the leadership of the United Arab Emirates as host of 
the International Renewable Energy Agency. We look 
forward to pursuing increased partnership with the 
United Arab Emirates and to establishing a dialogue 
with the Arab League on investment and development 
assistance in the Pacific region. 
 Finally, I must address one of this year’s most 
important issues within the United Nations. Member 
States and leaders must improve progress towards 
achieving the goal of stopping the spread of nuclear 
weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world 
without them. 
 The Marshall Islands has a unique reason for 
seeking the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. 
During our time as a United Nations Trust Territory, 
67 large-scale surface tests of nuclear weapons were 
conducted on our homeland, explicitly authorized 
under two United Nations resolutions, in 1954 and 
1956. No people should ever bear such a burden. For 
decades, we have told the United Nations about our 
communities who are still displaced, about the 
deliberate use of our people in scientific experiments 
and of ongoing health impacts inherited through 
generations. We continue to face the challenges of a 
 
 
3 10-55103 
 
United Nations-era nuclear waste storage site, 
surrounded by rising waters, towards dealing with 
which we lack resources or technical capacity. 
 We acknowledge important and positive actions 
already taken by partners, including our former 
administrator, the United States, but we need, and 
deserve, improved attention and assistance from the 
United States, as well as from the United Nations 
system and multilateral bodies. 
 I also acknowledge the support of the Pacific 
Islands Forum, including the leadership of the outgoing 
chair, Australia, as well as of the Non-Aligned 
Movement, in ensuring that this year’s Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons acknowledged 
the need to address sites contaminated by testing. I 
fully expect that Member States of the United Nations 
will be willing to further recognize that a special 
responsibility exists towards former United Nations 
Trust Territories adversely affected by nuclear testing. 
As the United Nations maps a global future of 
non-proliferation, the past legacy of nuclear activities 
can no longer be ignored. 
 The message is the same for nuclear weapons, 
global security and freedom from terrorism, or climate 
change: international law is not an empty promise."
2224,65,2010,VUT,"Vanuatu is very pleased 
that we are meeting under your presidency, Sir, and, on 
behalf of my Government and of the Pacific Islands 
Forum, I extend my warm congratulations to you, and 
we wish to assure you of our full confidence and 
cooperation. 
 I should also like to take a moment to pay tribute 
to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali 
Abdussalam Treki, for his exceptional service and 
leadership during the sixty-fourth session of the 
General Assembly and for the considerable and 
important achievements of that session. 
 
 
15 10-55128 
 
 In the same spirit, I take this opportunity also to 
commend the Secretary-General for his vision, 
leadership and tireless efforts in working towards 
achievements in the common interest of all humanity. 
 Many innocent lives continue to be wasted, with 
good people killed or wounded and multitudes 
displaced by heinous acts designed to undermine and 
destabilize the collective efforts of the international 
community to achieve peace and security for our 
societies. These many unprecedented events continue 
to test the very foundation of our Organization. 
 As we prepare to enter the second decade of this 
twenty-first century, it is vital now more than ever that 
our membership affirms its confidence and faith in the 
purposes and principles of the United Nations. It is 
important that we continue to assert our support for 
fundamental human rights and the peaceful coexistence 
of our nations. The range and urgency of the challenges 
that now confront the international community in our 
globalized and interdependent world demand, at the 
very least, our steadfast support for and commitment to 
peace and security for our communities and peoples, 
and for future generations. 
 If we are to effectively guarantee human rights 
and achieve peace and security and social and 
economic justice for all, we need to be united in this 
endeavour, and our cooperation and multilateral joint 
efforts need to be durable and effective. My 
Government and people of Vanuatu are steadfast in our 
belief that the United Nations remains uniquely suited 
to the pursuit and coordination of global initiatives to 
attain these objectives. 
 Vanuatu hosted the forty-first annual Pacific 
Islands Forum in our capital, Port Vila, last month. As 
current Chair, I wish to inform the Assembly that the 
Pacific Islands leaders again noted that transnational 
crime remains a threat to national and regional 
stability, in particular the proliferation of small arms 
and light weapons and illicit drugs. Consequently, the 
Pacific Islands Forum has strengthened cooperation in 
counter-terrorism measures and emphasized national 
efforts and regional cooperation in combating 
transnational organized crime and in strengthening 
border control capacities. The Pacific Islands Forum 
remains committed to collective arrangements and 
mechanisms to assist regional Governments recovering 
from national conflicts and crises. The value of those 
efforts is evident in the positive results of the Regional 
Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, created 
under the Biketawa Declaration with the assistance of 
contributing member States, which would not have 
been successful without the strong leadership and 
commitment of the Solomon Islands Government. 
 While many of our member countries have not 
ratified the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption (UNCAC), Forum leaders recognize the 
important role that the Convention offers in providing 
an internationally agreed framework for effective anti-
corruption activities around the world. I am pleased to 
say that our regional organizations are working with 
the various United Nations agencies to advance work 
to promote the Convention. 
 While known as a region characterized by 
oceanic isolation, smallness and general vulnerability, 
the Pacific region is one of only a few in the world to 
have experienced nuclear weapons testing. Therefore, 
advancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and 
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty — also 
known as the Treaty of Rarotonga — remains critical 
and relevant to our signatory member States. The South 
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty reflects our region’s 
deep commitment not only to international peace and 
security but also to collective international action to 
ensure peace and security. In endorsing the successful 
outcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review 
Conference, Forum leaders also welcomed the 
announcement by the United States of America of its 
intention to ratify all protocols of the Treaty of 
Rarotonga. 
 Notwithstanding their size, national obligations 
and circumstances, our respective Forum members 
value and are proud of their contributions to United 
Nations peacekeeping efforts. My own country is proud 
to contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions 
in East Timor, Haiti, the Sudan, Bosnia, the Peace 
Monitoring Group and the Bougainville Transition 
Team in Bougainville, and to the Regional Assistance 
Mission to the Solomon Islands. 
 Terrorism is an offence to humanity and contrary 
to the core values of the United Nations. We must be 
resolute in our national and collective efforts to combat 
terrorism in all its forms. For my own country, I 
reaffirm our strong support for the relevant Security 
Council resolutions against terrorism. Those 
resolutions provide a clear signal of our determination 
  
 
10-55128 16 
 
to suppress terrorist activities, including training, 
international movement and financing. 
 All of us present here today have described the 
various stages of our progress to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). For our 
island countries, our increasing vulnerability to threats 
and challenges, underscored by the impacts of the 
global economic, financial, fuel and food crises, is 
exacerbated by the current and impending impacts of 
climate change, as well as our inherent limited capacity 
to respond. This is not to say, however, that we have 
not made progress in achieving any of those goals. 
With respect to Goal 2, the primary education systems 
of the Pacific region are characterized by high 
enrolment, with six of our countries currently 
displaying net enrolment ratios of over 90 per cent. 
Most, if not all, of our Pacific island countries are 
expected to meet the goal of gender equality in 
education by 2015. We have been able to achieve those 
goals because we have localized the global indicators 
by adjusting them to suit our local circumstances and 
priorities. 
 While we remain concerned about the pace of our 
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, 
we are committed to accelerating progress towards 
achieving them by 2015. The Port Vila Declaration on 
Accelerating Progress on the Achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals, which was adopted by 
Pacific Forum leaders at their meeting in Vanuatu last 
month, recognizes that the MDGs are extremely 
important, as is also the incremental path towards 
achieving those Goals — a path that should recognize 
and accommodate the special circumstances and 
challenges we face in the Pacific. The Port Vila 
Declaration also highlights the importance of 
mainstreaming the programme of support for the 
sustainable development of small island developing 
States — which is captured in the Barbados 
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development 
of Small Island Developing States and the Mauritius 
Strategy for the Further Implementation of the 
Barbados Programme of Action — as an accelerator for 
achieving the MDGs in the Pacific and addressing the 
specific vulnerabilities that we face. To ensure the 
success of the Port Vila Declaration, we call for the 
support, collaborative action and commitment of the 
international community and our development partners — 
particularly an improved understanding of and ability 
to address our vulnerabilities and for improved 
coordination of efforts towards achieving the MDGs. 
 Advancing the Pacific islands’ work with respect 
to the Millennium Development Goals is closely and 
inextricably linked to the Mauritius Strategy. The 
development and endorsement of the Pacific Plan by 
the Forum leaders in 2005 underscored the critical 
need for creating stronger and deeper linkages between 
our countries and for identifying sectors where the 
region could gain the most by sharing resources in the 
area of governance and by aligning policies. While we 
believe that we have made some excellent progress in 
effectively implementing the Mauritius Strategy at the 
national and regional levels, we also acknowledge our 
shortcomings, some of which are beyond our control. 
The growing vulnerabilities of our Pacific island 
countries are exacerbated by the impacts of the global 
economic crisis, climate change and natural disasters, 
and those factors affect our abilities to respond. 
 Climate change remains the greatest threat to the 
livelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of 
the Pacific. Continuing and concerted efforts by Forum 
members are being made at the national, regional and 
international levels to address the impacts of climate 
change on Pacific communities and peoples. The 
degree of urgency for real commitments to emissions 
reduction must be commensurate with the science and 
with the associated impacts of climate change on the 
most vulnerable communities. This issue must not be 
viewed with an eye to short-term impacts on traditional 
industrial growth or political tenure, but rather with a 
longer-term consideration of the sustainability of 
economies, societies and peoples the world over. A 
meaningful, legally binding agreement on emissions 
reduction must be reached urgently and without delay. 
Recognizing the importance of effective coordination 
and implementation of climate change adaptation and 
mitigation efforts at all levels — and particularly at the 
national level — Forum leaders have endorsed a set of 
principles that will guide Forum island countries and 
development partners in this regard, bearing in mind 
existing and ongoing efforts in the region. Those 
principles are consistent with the Cairns Compact and 
the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate 
Change, and they reflect recognition by Forum leaders 
of the important role that regional and international 
arrangements play in supporting national adaptation 
and mitigation through the enhancement of capacity 
and access to resources.

 I am also pleased to say that, ahead of the Cancún 
climate change meetings this November and December, 
the Government of Kiribati will be hosting the Tarawa 
Climate Change Conference in November. We 
anticipate bringing together representatives of 
countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change, 
as well as representatives of major economies. 
 Allow me at this juncture to make a few remarks 
pertinent to Vanuatu’s position on a number of issues. 
We are meeting here at this Assembly session to once 
again renew our commitment to the United Nations and 
to the principles enshrined in its Charter. However, the 
need to reform the United Nations to ensure that it 
effectively responds to the needs of its Members 
remains imperative. 
 In that regard, I wish to commend the Secretary-
General for advancing the work on the reform of the 
Security Council. We note the work done by the Chair 
of the intergovernmental negotiations on the question 
of equitable representation and increase in the 
membership of the Security Council and other matters 
related to the Council. So we join all like-minded 
States in encouraging the United Nations to pursue 
equitable reforms in its institutions in order to 
minimize the democratic deficit in the multilateral 
arena. 
 My Government also joins all other heads of 
Governments that are Members of the United Nations 
family in congratulating the Secretary-General on 
bringing to a reality the efforts over four years to 
create the office of UN Women, a new entity formally 
established by the General Assembly within the United 
Nations created in July of this year. That decision gives 
more prominence to women and their place in our 
society.  
 Vanuatu celebrated 30 years of political freedom 
last July. This year marks the end of the Second 
International Decade of Decolonization. My 
Government wishes to question the progress on some 
important processes of self-determination. It is 
disturbing to think that we may legitimize practices 
that contravene the very principles on which this 
Organization has been founded. Are we to assume that 
decolonization issues may be ignored in the years to 
come so as not to unsettle the status quo? 
 Issues relating to decolonization and severe 
human rights violations must be effectively and 
impartially addressed. We call upon the United Nations 
to strengthen its efforts in working towards full 
decolonization of Territories that are still under the 
control of administrating Powers. Where there are 
serious reports of human rights violations, there must 
be a stronger United Nations role in investigating all 
allegations of human atrocity. We are reminded that the 
noble task of our multilateral Organization is to 
reaffirm our commitment to and respect for 
fundamental human rights and the dignity of the human 
person. 
 We are encouraged to see emerging nations, such 
as Kosovo, rising from the turmoil of restraint to take 
up their position in the midst of the independent 
nations of the world. It is in the spirit of democratic 
freedom that justice must prevail for those peoples 
whose right to political freedom continues to be 
suppressed by colonial and illegitimate administrating 
Powers. That includes for those countries whose 
political freedom to claim their rights to territorial 
sovereignty under the United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea and those whose political freedom 
to rightfully claim an extended continental shelf under 
the Convention are suppressed by colonial 
administrative rule. 
 As we applaud calls for a peaceful resolution of 
the conflict between Israel and Palestine, my country 
also calls for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba, which 
will enable the good people of Cuba to improve their 
lives. 
 My country, together with other least developed 
countries in the Pacific, has consistently argued in this 
forum that the mechanisms and criteria for assessing 
graduation eligibility must not be isolated from the 
permanent and inherent vulnerabilities of our countries. 
It is unrealistic for United Nations agencies to look at 
the progress and make projections without taking into 
consideration the issues of permanent vulnerabilities 
and capacity to sustain growth in our countries. 
Indicators for most Millennium Development Goals 
clearly demonstrate little progress in human 
development. Climate change, volcanic eruptions and 
other disasters will continue to be significant factors 
inhibiting human development in our islands. Such 
factors are critical, and we therefore reiterate our 
position that they must be carefully weighed in the 
vulnerability graduation criteria. 
 In the case of our very close neighbour, Fiji, my 
Government believes that all players are interested in 
  
 
10-55128 18 
 
seeing positive political progress there, which must 
continue to genuinely engage the good people of Fiji. 
We have learned that multilateralism offers some 
constructive innovations in diplomatic practice, but it 
may also complicate conflict resolution by increasing 
tension between actors. 
 Finally, in the spirit of reconciliation through the 
Pacific way, I call upon all international and regional 
diplomatic actors to assist in ways that will not 
polarize the region. Instead, our diplomatic approaches 
should help to give genuine dialogue and engagement a 
more credible opportunity. There should be genuine 
and renewed commitment to fostering relations in the 
Pacific region, commitment that promotes greater 
freedom, regional cooperation, friendship and 
integration, as envisaged in the Pacific Plan document. 
 In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express 
my gratitude to all our development partners for the 
support that they are providing in building our 
economies. I believe more can be done to assist the 
Pacific island countries in addressing the growing 
challenges confronting the region."
2242,65,2010,NZL,"It is an honour to 
lead New Zealand’s delegation this year. The opening 
of the General Assembly’s new session is the best 
example there is of the capacity of the United Nations 
to bring us all together. Our discussions here will be 
wide-ranging, but inevitably settle on two main issues: 
global security and sustainable economic development.  
 We want to make our world safer, more secure 
and more prosperous. These goals will require strong 
collective action with a focus on practical outcomes. 
New Zealand is seeking every opportunity to 
contribute. We are a young, small and fair-minded 
country. We depend upon a United Nations that is 
effective and credible. 
 New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. In 
addition to our indigenous Maori population, we are a 
mix of people from Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Our 
links with Europe are built on history and tradition. 
Within Asia, we are developing ever-stronger economic 
and security relationships. Our future is closely tied to 
both of these regions. We have an equally strong focus 
on our closest neighbours in the South Pacific. New 
Zealand is a Pacific country. Auckland is the largest 
Pasifika city in the world, and a number of Pacific 
countries have more citizens living in New Zealand 
than at home. 
 The security and development of the region is 
New Zealand’s constant preoccupation. It is a matter of 
grave concern that the South Pacific is second only to 
sub-Saharan Africa in terms of lack of progress 
towards the achievement of some of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). We want to see the 
MDGs achieved, and we want to see the wider Pacific 
prosper through good governance and sustainable 
economic development. That is why New Zealand is 
increasingly deploying our development resources 
within its region, since that is where they are most 
needed and where they can be most effective. 
 The development challenges in the Pacific are 
extremely complex, with vulnerable economies and 
challenging environmental circumstances. New 
Zealand has increased and will continue to increase our 
overall level of development assistance, despite 
challenging times for our domestic economy. A higher 
percentage of that larger budget will be focused on our 
region. 
 But money alone is not enough; aid effectiveness 
and donor coordination are vital. Progress will also 
depend on good governance within the region. 
 Next year we will mark the fortieth anniversary 
of the Pacific Islands Forum, the central body for 
regional engagement in the Pacific, which held its first 
meeting in New Zealand in 1971. We will welcome 
leaders from around the region back to New Zealand 
next September to celebrate our achievements over 
40 years and to take stock of the challenges we must 
face in the future. 
 The past year has reinforced the need for better 
disaster management. Just three weeks ago, residents in 
Christchurch woke to the most destructive earthquake 
in New Zealand in 80 years. Miraculously, there was 
no loss of life, but the damage runs into billions of 
dollars and people’s lives and livelihoods were 
affected. Significant aftershocks are still affecting the 
 
 
51 10-54965 
 
population. But less than a month after the earthquake 
hit, roads and buildings have been repaired, tourism 
infrastructure is at almost full capacity, and people’s 
lives are being rebuilt. 
 Others have not been so lucky. The earthquakes 
in Haiti and Chile and the recent flooding in Pakistan 
are reminders of the devastating scale of such disasters. 
The Pacific has been hit hard, too. This month will 
mark the first anniversary of the Pacific tsunami that 
took the lives of 184 people in Samoa, American 
Samoa and Tonga. 
 These events and others demonstrate the 
importance of disaster preparedness, management and 
recovery. New Zealand’s experience with major 
earthquakes has taught us how to mitigate risks, 
enforce strong building codes, and implement effective 
recovery plans. But there will be lessons we should 
learn from this recent experience. We will work with 
the United Nations system, non-governmental 
organizations and other international agencies to 
ensure that those lessons are shared and help others to 
prepare. 
 While development and disaster management are 
crucial to our quest for a safer world, underpinning 
both is security. Peacekeeping is a key responsibility of 
the Organization. Indeed, it is its peacekeeping 
operations that shape perceptions of the United Nations 
for many people around the world. 
 New Zealand is committed to supporting global 
security and United Nations peacekeeping. That is why 
we have been engaged in peacekeeping and peace 
support operations since the 1940s. New Zealand’s 
soldiers, police, engineers, corrections and customs 
officers, doctors and other personnel are today 
involved in 12 operations that span the globe from 
Africa, Afghanistan and the Middle East to Asia and 
the Pacific. 
 One of the clearest examples of New Zealand’s 
commitment to the principles of collective 
responsibility is through the United Nations effort in 
Timor-Leste. Since 1999, New Zealand has been a part 
of every United Nations mission that has served in 
Timor-Leste. We have played a major role in the 
United Nations-sanctioned international military 
operations that restored order there in 1999 and again 
in 2006. Over 6,000 New Zealanders have served in 
Timor in the past decade — a significant undertaking 
for a country of only 4.4 million people. 
 Of course, helping ensure peace and stability in 
our region alone is not enough. New Zealanders are 
among those who have been affected by terrorism, 
killed in the attacks that took place just a few blocks 
away from here in September 2001, and more recently 
in Bali, in London and in Jakarta. 
 The need to respond decisively to those who 
perpetrate such atrocities is a key reason why New 
Zealand has led the provincial reconstruction team in 
Bamyan, Afghanistan, since 2003. We have redeployed 
our special forces to work alongside the Government of 
Afghanistan and the international community to ensure 
that that country does not return to being a safe haven 
for Al-Qaida. We must address the conditions in which 
terrorism thrives. We are increasing our development 
spending in Bamyan and recently placed the Provincial 
Reconstruction Team under civilian leadership for the 
first time. 
 New Zealand is also strongly supportive of 
peacekeeping reform. The expansion in peacekeeping 
since 1990 has been dramatic. Never before has this 
Organization deployed so many missions to such 
complex environments. This expansion has opened up 
discussion of the way the United Nations conducts its 
peacekeeping operations. Clear and achievable 
mandates are needed, progress needs to be better 
monitored, and efficiency needs to be improved. 
 We are also contributing to United Nations efforts 
to strengthen peacebuilding in practice, including the 
need for better participation of women in 
peacebuilding. Of course, the response of the United 
Nations to crises has not always been successful. It is 
for this reason that New Zealand has strongly 
supported the responsibility to protect (R2P). We were 
pleased to contribute to the proposed joint Special 
Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide/R2P office and 
look forward to the more comprehensive 
implementation of R2P throughout the United Nations 
system. 
 Effective pursuit of these goals — countering 
terrorism and maintaining peace and security — 
demands coordinated, collective action. The United 
Nations is the best vehicle for that action. New Zealand 
has been, and remains, proud to be a part of that 
community of collective action. In line with that 
commitment, New Zealand is seeking a seat on the 
Security Council for the 2015-2016 term. In doing so, 
  
 
10-54965 52 
 
we will work with others here who want the world to 
be a safer and more prosperous place. 
 This year significant gains have been made in 
global disarmament. New Zealand welcomes the action 
plan adopted at this year’s Non-Proliferation Treaty 
Review Conference, the groundbreaking nuclear 
security summit, and the entry into force of the 
Convention on Cluster Munitions. These are tangible 
and practical successes. But we still face some 
significant challenges. New Zealand is concerned by 
the continuing inertia of the Conference on 
Disarmament. The Secretary-General’s High-level 
Meeting on disarmament this morning was a valuable 
step in acknowledging this problem and trying to find a 
way forward. 
 As a country that prides itself on sustainable 
development, New Zealand is also greatly concerned 
about global environmental issues. As well as working 
towards an outcome in Cancún, we are involved in 
practical projects for addressing climate change. One 
such project is the Global Research Alliance on 
Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Fourteen per cent of 
worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions come from 
agriculture. At the same time, there are projections that 
world food production needs to increase by 50 per cent 
in the next 20 years, and to double in the next 40 years, 
to feed a growing world. 
 Clearly, we need a scientific breakthrough to help 
meet the challenge of producing more food while 
reducing emissions. New Zealand formed the Alliance, 
which now includes more than 30 agricultural nations, 
to find ways to address this problem. Scientists and 
researchers are now linking up across the world to try 
to balance the need for increased agricultural 
production with the need to address climate change. 
This is just one example of how countries can come 
together to address climate change in a very real way. 
 When I was here a year ago, we were watching to 
see whether the world would be able to climb out of 
the global economic recession. Much progress has been 
made and key economic indicators are generally 
pointing in the right direction. The rapid and 
coordinated international response, including by the 
Group of 20, has been effective. The World Trade 
Organization’s rules-based trading system has held up 
well. But, like many countries, New Zealand is 
frustrated that the conclusion of the Doha Development 
Round still eludes us. 
 Over these last few days, especially in the context 
of discussion of progress towards the Millennium 
Development Goals, I have heard many fine words 
spoken in support of the world’s disadvantaged. I take 
this opportunity to remind those speakers and countries 
that the single most effective step that could be taken 
to advance the position of the world’s disadvantaged 
would be to create a framework within which they can 
trade themselves to a better future. 
 I want to strongly endorse President Obama’s 
statement, made yesterday, that there is no viable 
alternative to the resolution of conflict in the Middle 
East other than two States, Israel and Palestine, living 
side by side in peace and security. We believe that 
direct negotiations, with both parties at the table, are 
the only way to resolve the conflict. We congratulate 
President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu on 
having the courage to negotiate in very difficult 
circumstances. We ask that Israel heed the international 
community’s unanimous call to extend the moratorium 
on settlements and create the enabling atmosphere that 
will allow direct negotiations to continue. 
 We also agree with President Obama that 
resolution of the Middle East conflict is not just the 
responsibility of Israel and Palestine. Countries in the 
region especially, but also countries elsewhere, must 
work towards Middle East peace. New Zealand, as a 
friend of both Israel and Palestine, will play its part. I 
recently visited the Sinai, where a New Zealand officer 
has command of the Multinational Force and 
Observers. I was reminded that there has been peace 
between Israel and Egypt for more than 30 years, a 
prospect once unthinkable. With the commitment of the 
two parties and the support of the international 
community, Israel and Palestine can enjoy the same 
freedom from conflict. We all have a huge stake in 
achieving that objective. Resolution of the Palestinian 
question would tear out the fuse that threatens to ignite 
conflict in the Middle East and beyond. 
 So today we add our voice to that of President 
Obama and of others who believe that this dispute can, 
and must, be solved. And we call on all Members of 
the United Nations to lend their support to this process 
in the critical weeks ahead."
2259,65,2010,PNG,"First 
of all, let me join other delegations in offering 
congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on 
his election to the post of President of the General 
Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your guidance, 
Sir, my delegation is confident that we can discuss, in 
the spirit of cooperation, the different global challenges 
confronting us in order to further the common good of 
humankind. 
 We are meeting at a time when the world is going 
through some mixed developments. While, on some 
parts of the globe, countries are experiencing relative 
peace, in other parts they are embroiled in armed 
conflict. While some countries are enjoying economic 
growth and budget surpluses, others are experiencing 
economic stagnation or contraction. 
 The focus at this session of the General Assembly 
on reviewing the progress on the implementation of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is most 
appropriate. The achievement of the eight cross-cutting 
Goals we set for ourselves would improve the quality 
of life of all of our peoples. Just last week, we 
concluded a stocktaking of the progress in the 
implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. 
While the results on the scorecard are mixed, the 
commitment of Member States to continuing to 
implement measures to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals by 2015 is unequivocal. 
 Papua New Guinea, like many developing 
countries, has had measured success. As many noted 
last week, the global economic crisis has had an 
adverse bearing on the implementation of the MDGs. I 
would add, however, that had the resources promised in 
2000 for implementing the MDGs been made available, 
the assessment sheet for many developing countries 
would have looked more positive. Papua New Guinea 
applauds the commitment of $40 billion for poverty 
alleviation, especially to improve the health of children 
and women. It is our hope that this will be a new 
resource envelope and not repackaged old 
commitments. 
 We have noted the calls for countries to take 
greater ownership of the implementation of the eight 
Millennium Development Goals. Papua New Guinea 
has accepted these challenges. We will continue to do 
  
 
10-55128 2 
 
all we can to meet the obligations we assumed when 
we joined others in 2000 to adopt the Millennium 
Declaration (resolution 55/2).  
 The Permanent Representative of Papua New 
Guinea to the United Nations outlined in detail last 
week our country’s efforts to achieve the MDGs by 
2015. Allow me to reiterate some of the main actions 
we are taking. Papua New Guinea has adapted and 
localized the MDGs by establishing 15 targets and 67 
indicators within our medium-term development 
strategy for the period 2005 to 2010. We have 
calibrated our 2011-2015 medium-term development 
plan and designed our development strategic plan to 
achieve the MDGs. In addition, we have drafted our 
2050 Vision Statement to be consistent with the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
 Our official development assistance programmes 
with our donor partners are being gradually realigned 
to enable Papua New Guinea to eventually meet its 
MDG targets. On a wider scale, we urge donor partners 
to abide by the principles of the Paris Declaration on 
Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. In 
the Pacific, we have adopted the Cairns Compact to 
better coordinate development assistance and to ensure 
effective delivery. Developed countries also need to 
raise their official development assistance to 0.7 per 
cent of their gross national income, in line with their 
commitments. 
 In line with our commitment towards MDG 3, my 
Government has submitted proposed legislation to the 
Papua New Guinea legislature to reserve 22 seats for 
women in the national Parliament. With respect to 
MDG 2, we have introduced a universal primary 
education policy and aim to achieve free primary-level 
education for all of our children by 2015. 
 Papua New Guinea is under no illusion that the 
achievement of the MDGs is a unilateral undertaking. 
This is a joint undertaking between developed and 
developing countries, just as it is a cooperative effort 
between the Government and civil society 
organizations. It is for this reason that my country is 
disappointed that MDG 8 on a global partnership for 
development appears to attract little serious interest 
from the developed countries. We note that the real 
value of aid has remained constant and that the Doha 
Development Round remains an unfinished affair. 
 Also of concern to us is the inability of many 
developing countries to enjoy equitable treatment from 
the Bretton Woods institutions. Our efforts to reduce 
deforestation in tropical rain forest countries, which I 
will touch on later, have met with the same apathetic 
response. Despite the best of efforts within the World 
Trade Organization and Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum processes, the international trading 
environment continues to be characterized by 
inequalities. Often less visibly but still harmfully, 
global trade continues to be encumbered by trade 
protectionist measures. 
 In the area of international peace and security, the 
world, unfortunately, is no safer today than it was when 
the United Nations was established. War continues to 
be waged in Afghanistan. Iraq continues to suffer from 
regular suicide bombings. The Korean peninsula 
continues to be a flashpoint in the Asia region, and the 
Middle East continues to be a hotbed of tension. 
 Likewise, regional conflicts and ethnic tensions 
continue to erupt in many parts of Africa, Latin 
America and Eastern Europe. The international 
community needs to do more to address these conflicts, 
especially the Afghanistan and Iraq issues. The fragile 
peace and global security environment is further 
exemplified by the continued presence of Blue Helmets 
in many parts of world. 
 Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of 
United Nations peacekeeping forces, many of which 
have to operate in very trying circumstances. We wish 
to thank the troop-contributing countries for bearing 
this onerous responsibility on all our behalves. For our 
part, I am pleased to announce that my Government 
has enacted the International Obligations Bill to 
provide the legal framework for Papua New Guinea’s 
participation in United Nations peacekeeping 
operations. 
 Acts of terrorism continue and the threat of 
another terror attack on a scale similar to that of 9/11 
remains real. The international community must 
continue to strengthen its cooperation to address this 
scourge. 
 Nuclear weapons continue to cause anxiety in our 
security considerations. While some may argue that 
nuclear weapons are the reason why the world has not 
fought another world war, my Government believes 
that these weapons of mass destruction are unnecessary 
and need to be eliminated. As part of that process, we 
support efforts to strengthen the mechanisms aimed at 
the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
 
 
3 10-55128 
 
 As for other countries of the Pacific region, 
climate change is of great concern to Papua New 
Guinea. We need no scientist to tell us of the negative 
impact of climate change. We live it and we suffer 
from it. Many of our islands, such as the Carterets, and 
coastal habitats like my own home area of the Murik 
Lakes are being gradually submerged by rising sea 
levels. The result is that people living in these areas are 
becoming environmental refugees. Lowland diseases 
such as malaria are now occurring in the highlands of 
Papua New Guinea. Unusual weather patterns, such as 
increased incidences of cyclones, frequent heavy 
flooding and mudslides, are causing havoc in our 
economies and exacting untold suffering on our people. 
 All these attendant climate change challenges are 
taxing the budgetary resources of our countries and 
undermining our development plans. The international 
community has rightly recognized the insidious effects 
of climate change and agreed to take concerted action 
under the ambit of the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Road 
Map and the Copenhagen Accord to address the issue. 
 Papua New Guinea urges our developed partners 
to shoulder greater responsibility for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and for assisting developing 
countries, particularly small island States, to adapt to 
climate change and its effects. 
 Resources for adaptation and mitigation 
measures, particularly those committed in Copenhagen, 
must be made more readily available to developing 
countries. We note the initiative announced by Japan 
last week during the MDG review and look forward to 
further details of what it constitutes. We also applaud 
the financial commitments and policy initiatives that 
China announced to assist developing countries to 
implement the Millennium Development Goals. As for Papua New Guinea, with our colleagues 
from the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, we have 
committed ourselves to a programme of reducing 
emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, 
more commonly known as REDD-plus. As this is the 
International Year of Biodiversity, let me say that the 
REDD-plus initiative will assure the protection of 
important biodiversity. 
 In addition, at the national level Papua New 
Guinea has adopted an action plan for climate-
compatible development and established the Office of 
Climate Change and Development explicitly to oversee 
our actions on climate change issues. As part of our 
strategy to reduce our carbon footprint, we are now 
aggressively seeking to develop more hydropower and 
geothermal sources for our energy requirements. We 
have also embarked on a major commercialization 
exercise of our gas reserves to deliver a cleaner energy 
alternative to the world. 
 Many of us here have recognized the need to 
reform the United Nations in order to take account of 
the changed circumstances under which it operates, as 
well as the new and emerging challenges that it must 
address. We note and commend the Secretary-General 
for the ongoing administrative and institutional reforms 
he is undertaking to improve the efficiency of the 
United Nations in better serving Member States. We 
urge all stakeholders in the Security Council reform 
agenda to demonstrate courage and leadership so that 
the composition and workings of the Council can be 
reformed in ways that are equitable and reflect the 
current geopolitical and economic realities. 
 Papua New Guinea has previously stated at this 
Assembly that we believe that the expansion of the 
membership of the Security Council is logical to allow 
for representation from certain developed and 
developing countries. In that regard, I wish to reaffirm 
Papua New Guinea’s support for Germany and Japan to 
be included as permanent members in an expanded 
Security Council. 
 Finally, the inequities that exist in the global 
trading system today are daunting, but they can be 
resolved. With genuine partnership, we can and shall 
overcome them. The world may not be any safer today 
than it was when the United Nations was established 
some 65 years ago, but having been able to avert 
another world war is ample testimony that the 
international community has the political will to 
address tensions and discord in a measured way. The 
United Nations and the international legal architecture 
that it has achieved, developed and promoted have 
played a significant role in that regard, thus 
underscoring the continuing relevance of this body. "
2326,65,2010,NRU,"I would like to offer my 
heartfelt congratulations to the President of the 
Assembly on his assumption of the presidency of this 
body at its sixty-fifth session. Also, allow me to 
commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali 
Abdussalam Treki, for his capable leadership during 
the sixty-fourth session. 
 This week is vitally important for my island 
nation of Nauru and for small island developing States 
generally. This week we will complete the high-level 
reviews of the Millennium Development Goals and the 
Mauritius Strategy, two programmes that are central to 
the sustainable development prospects of my country.  
 We gather here on this occasion to reaffirm the 
central role of the United Nations in global 
governance. However, the centrality of the United 
Nations system must derive from its ability to help 
bring about positive outcomes for all of its 
membership. In that regard, the United Nations report 
card is mixed. 
 While this body and others have brought attention 
to the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small 
island developing States, they have not always 
succeeded in delivering concrete benefits. There is a 
proliferation of global action plans but a paucity of 
action. For this reason, Nauru has relied more on its 
domestic institutions and bilateral partners than on 
multilateral governance solutions. 
 Nauru turned a corner in 2005 when it adopted its 
National Sustainable Development Strategy, commonly 
known to us as our NSDS. Under that plan we have 
made significant progress across most sectors. Our 
financial system is now more transparent and 
Government more accountable. Most importantly, we 
have restored some measures of security for our 
citizens: expanded public health programmes, new and 
refurbished schools, updated curriculum and more 
teachers. Power is more reliable and its usage more 
efficient. Regular air and maritime travel has been 
restored, and we have seen major improvements in our 
communications system. 
 Most of the gains in the past five years have been 
the result of our own efforts, largely supported by 
bilateral development partners targeting our national 
plans. However, our journey is far from over. Our 
NSDS lays out a clear path forward to aid 
independence based on our national circumstances and 
capacity. Its medium- and long-term milestones are 
fully consistent with, and complementary to, the 
Millennium Development Goals and Mauritius Strategy 
programmes. It is my hope that the United Nations can 
play a more significant role in this next phase of our 
development.  
 Five years after our initial request, I am pleased 
that the United Nations has opened its joint presence 
office in Nauru. It is my hope that that will enable 
United Nations agencies to be more familiar with, and 
responsive to, our unique development challenges. 
 The future of all my people depends on an 
effective United Nations system, but none more so than 
the future of our youth. Not long ago, my country 
  
 
10-54965 34 
 
suffered a devastating economic crisis. It was followed 
by the explosion in global fuel and food prices and 
then by the global economic downturn, which many of 
us are still grappling with today. Those crises were 
exacerbated by virtue of Nauru being a small and 
isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As a 
country, we will overcome. However, some impacts 
will be felt longer than others. 
 Perhaps the cruellest legacy of our economic 
crisis is the impact it had on the youth who grew up 
during that trying time. Advantages that my generation 
took for granted — a good education, basic health care 
and abundant job opportunities — were simply not 
available for many of our youth during a critical period 
in their lives. In the absence of such advantages, 
substance abuse, illiteracy, delinquency and lifestyle-
related illnesses became commonplace. As we progress 
as a nation, we must ensure that we do not leave one 
segment of our community behind. Our collective 
future will not be secure unless we invest in the 
community and business leaders of tomorrow. 
 It is for this reason that Nauru appreciates the 
importance of the International Year of Youth, which 
commenced in August 2010. This United Nations 
tradition began 25 years ago when this body 
recognized the profoundly important role that youth 
should have in shaping a new international economic 
order based on equity and justice. 
 My Government has made investing in our youth 
a top priority. Nauru is on track to reach our 
Millennium Development Goal of universal primary 
education by 2015. We have been successful despite 
the significant shortage of quality Nauruan teachers.  
 Of equal importance to the development of our 
primary and secondary education systems is the need to 
develop technical and vocational training, recognizing 
and certifying skills and job-oriented training. Only by 
continued investment in human resource development 
will the next generation of Nauruans be prepared for 
the challenges of the twenty-first century. 
 Our health sector, too, has made gains in curative 
services and preventative health programmes. 
However, around 75 per cent of people in the Pacific 
suffer from non-communicable diseases. That is not 
sustainable. Investments in public health must be 
accompanied by investments in improving food 
security. It will be difficult to change that alarming 
statistic for the better unless my people have a reliable 
supply of affordable and nutritious food. Health 
education must also receive more emphasis in our 
educational programmes. 
 Education and public health are obviously two 
areas that are fundamental for the well-being of our 
youth, but alone they are not enough. Our youth must 
also be given the opportunity to use their skills in 
productive ways, lest those skills wither on the vine. 
For that we need a growing economy, and for a 
growing economy we must look to our development 
partners and multilateral institutions for assistance. 
 Aid should be deployed so as to build a 
foundation for sustainable development in all economic 
sectors, including basic infrastructure, in which to date 
there has been less progress than in health and 
education. The re-establishment of banking and 
financial services continues to elude us despite all our 
urgent efforts to obtain assistance. Nation-building and 
youth development must run parallel to each other if 
either is to succeed. Investments in basic infrastructure 
will enable us to expand our economic base, increase 
exports and also reduce the costs of imports. 
 The United Nations system must also be 
enhanced in order to avoid the mistakes of the past. 
That is why we are joining others in calling for the 
creation of a formal small island developing States 
(SIDS) category within the United Nations system.  
 The international community has consistently 
recognized the unique vulnerabilities of the small 
island developing States, yet that recognition has not 
been translated into effective action. The preparatory 
work for the five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy 
for the Further Implementation of the Programme of 
Action for the Sustainable Development of Small 
Island Developing States found that the vulnerabilities 
of SIDS remain and that progress towards sustainable 
development is far below expectations. It is clear that 
business as usual is not working and that a new 
approach is long overdue. 
 The creation of a new SIDS category would make 
the United Nations more responsive to the particular 
needs of small islands. This new category should be 
accompanied by structural support mechanisms in the 
areas of development assistance, financial support and 
trade. Only by dealing with the vulnerabilities of SIDS 
can there be any realistic prospect of SIDS attaining 
sustainable economic growth.

 The most important test of our commitment to 
our youth is the state of the world that we leave to 
them. We have long been aware of the environmental 
crises currently facing our oceans and our climate, but 
we have done precious little to address them. Without 
immediate and aggressive international action on both 
fronts, we will bequeath to our children a world that is 
far poorer than the one we ourselves inhabited. 
 Nauru takes these threats very seriously, which is 
why my country, along with other island countries in 
the Pacific, recently strengthened the Nauru 
Agreement. That multilateral agreement on oceans 
governance is a major step in strengthening an 
effective regime for managing and protecting regional 
tuna stocks. The preservation of that resource is 
essential to our region’s food security and to our 
economic development. Regrettably, the sustainability 
of the tuna stocks and other marine resources that we 
rely on is threatened by actions beyond our control. 
Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and 
overfishing by large fishing nations is rife in the 
Pacific, and we lack sufficient resources to respond to 
that criminal activity. One of the pillars of our 
economic future is literally being stolen from our 
children. 
 With regard to climate change, my island and 
many others like it face an existential threat far beyond 
our capacity to adapt. Rising sea levels and extreme 
weather may one day render my home uninhabitable. 
But an island can die long before it has disappeared 
beneath the sea. All that is required is to deprive its 
youth of hope. What incentive will they have to invest 
in their home if it will not be there for when they are 
older? We have an opportunity to change course later 
this year at the United Nations Climate Change 
Conference to be held in Cancún. We must act as if our 
children’s future depended on the decisions we make. 
 Climate change is a global issue and demands the 
full participation of all. We therefore call on the 
immediate inclusion of Taiwan in the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
process. We must also recognize that climate change 
poses many threats — security threats — that are not 
addressed under the UNFCCC process. That is why the 
Pacific small island developing States introduced in the 
General Assembly a resolution on climate change and 
its possible security implications (resolution 63/281). 
The Security Council, as the primary body of the 
United Nations entrusted with preserving international 
peace and security, must also play its role. 
 Lastly, we must ensure that the views and 
perspectives of all nations and peoples are incorporated 
into the decision-making of the United Nations system 
and its specialized agencies. In that context, Nauru 
strongly supports Taiwan’s campaign for meaningful 
participation in the International Civil Aviation 
Organization. 
 I would like to conclude by thanking our 
development partners for their long-standing 
commitment to Nauru, particularly our major 
partners — Australia, Taiwan, the Russia Federation, 
New Zealand, the European Union and Japan — as 
well as our many other active partners, including Cuba, 
Italy, India, the Republic of Korea and Israel. We 
further recognize the international and regional 
organizations that have continued to stand by our side 
during a difficult period in our history, and I look 
forward to our continuing cooperation. 
 I would also like to commend the United Nations 
for beginning a difficult process of reflection and 
reform so as to be able to more effectively respond to 
the global challenges we all face. Nauru looks forward 
to participating in this important discussion so that the 
United Nations can continue to play a central role in 
global governance. 
 May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may 
God bless the United Nations."
2351,65,2010,AUS,"This great body has been 
in existence for two thirds of a century — three times 
longer than its predecessor body, the League of 
Nations, and longer than previous attempts to fashion a 
continuing collective approach to the common 
problems of nation States. The question we must ask 
ourselves today is whether the United Nations remains 
effective in confronting the challenges of our time. 
 The United Nations was established in the grim 
aftermath of the two deadliest conflicts in human 
history, in which close to 80 million people were killed 
and entire families and almost entire generations lost 
for all time. The world came together out of necessity. 
There had to be a better way, and in the decades since 
we first met at San Francisco, we have managed to 
avoid another world war, although at times that seemed 
less than certain. 
 Today, we are faced with a different set of 
challenges and in different strategic, political and 
economic circumstances. We now live in a world that is 
more multipolar and more interconnected than ever 
before. We are confronted with the double-edged sword 
of globalization. The transformation of the global 
economy has increased living standards and lifted 
many hundreds of millions out of poverty. 
 At the same time, the increased interdependence 
of global financial markets ensured that no country 
connected to the world economy was spared the impact 
of the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the rapid 
transformation of global communications and the 
radical increase in global people movements have 
improved the well-being of all humankind. But equally, 
they have created or at least amplified a new set of 
security threats to all humankind: pandemic diseases, 
transnational organized crime and the continuing threat 
of global terrorism. There is also the global challenge 
of climate change. The unconstrained carbon emissions 
of one State impact on the long-term survival of all 
States. Climate change respects no national or 
geographic boundaries and thus simultaneously 
demands both national and integrated global responses. 
 So two thirds of a century after our formation, we 
the United Nations now face increasingly complex 
global challenges in an increasingly fragmented world 
and a much more contested international space. These 
new global realities create an imperative for 
responsive, representative and, most critically, 
effective systems of global governance. 
 If we fail to make the United Nations work and to 
make its institutions relevant to the great challenges we 
all now face, the uncomfortable fact is that the United 
Nations will become a hollow shell. Nation States may 
retain its form, but will increasingly seek to go around 
it and deploy other mechanisms to achieve real results. 
 And that is the question we all face today. It is a 
question of our collective political will to make the 
existing institutions work and combine the existing and 
unique legitimacy of the United Nations system with a 
new-found effectiveness on security, development and 
climate change. 
 The United Nations has most of the essential 
structures in place, but if the structures are to work we 
must harness the political will necessary to make them 
work. In other words, we must enable the institutions 
we have created to do the job for which they were 
created. Put even more starkly, we must do that which 
we say. If we have a Conference on Disarmament, it 
should do disarmament — not pretend. If we have a 
convention on climate change, it must do the job to 
tackle climate change — not just talk about it, and 
similarly with development. Otherwise, the credibility 
of the United Nations in the eyes of the world and our 
own citizens will eventually collapse. The international 
community can no longer tolerate the actions of a few 
dissenting States to roadblock the common resolve of 
the many. 
 The international community faces the continuing 
challenge of international terrorism. Terrorism knows 
no geographic or political boundaries. We are now in 
the tenth year since terrorists launched their murderous 
attack on this great city of New York. The threat of 
international terrorism remains alive. It continues to 
challenge civilized norms, to generate fear and 
insecurity, and to take innocent civilian lives in many 
parts of the world. 
 
 
41 10-55103 
 
 The outlawing of terrorist organizations under the 
provisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions, 
together with the individual and cooperative measures 
taken by Member States, reflect the unprecedented 
levels of international collaboration in responding to 
the worldwide threat of terrorism. 
 As part of the effort to combat terrorism, many 
Member States have their armed forces and other 
personnel committed to Afghanistan, again sanctioned 
by Security Council resolutions. These brave soldiers, 
police officers and aid workers, representing so many 
of the countries represented here in the General 
Assembly, including Australia, remain in Afghanistan 
following many years of conflict. 
 The result is that Afghanistan no longer 
represents an unimpeded base for the global operations 
of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida. The result 
is also that we are all contributing to the security and 
stability of Afghanistan as a nation. This has been a 
difficult war, but our collective resolve is strong 
enough to prevent Afghanistan from once again 
becoming a base for the export of terrorism. 
 Beyond Afghanistan, terrorism continues to 
remain a threat to people of all faiths and civilizations. 
We must remain nationally and internationally vigilant 
against the possibility of further terrorist attacks. The 
threat remains real. 
 We must equally be concerned about the 
continued challenge of nuclear proliferation. Violations 
of the non-proliferation regime by States such as the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran 
represent a potent and potential threat to us all. It is for 
this reason that Australia provides robust support to the 
United Nations sanctions regime against both the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran. 
 The United Nations has played a critical role in 
promoting the goal of a world without nuclear 
weapons. Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament 
are mutually reinforcing processes and cannot be 
separated. 
 Australia’s activism on arms control and 
disarmament remains undiminished. And there remains 
much urgent work to be done. In 1996, Australia 
sponsored the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
in this Assembly to ensure its adoption. Since then, 
182 States have signed the Treaty and 153 have ratified 
it. Nine more States are needed to ratify in order for the 
Treaty to enter into force. Australia welcomes recent 
statements by Indonesia and the United States 
concerning their intention to ratify the Treaty, and we 
would urge all States that to date have failed to indicate 
their intention to ratify the Treaty to do so in order to 
enable it to enter into force. 
 The most recent Treaty on the Non-proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference was 
held earlier this year. Australia and Japan worked 
closely together in the lead-up to the Conference, 
including through the jointly sponsored report of the 
International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation 
and Disarmament (ICNND), prepared by the former 
Foreign Minister of Australia, Gareth Evans, and his 
Japanese counterpart, Yoriko Kawaguchi. This 
significant report provided substantial momentum in 
the lead-up to the Review Conference. We believe that 
the Evans-Kawaguchi report of the ICNND also 
represents the most comprehensive, practical and 
contemporary blueprint for the international 
community to both consider and adopt a 
comprehensive arms control and non-proliferation 
agenda. 
 The Review Conference agreed by consensus on 
64 sets of actions. And Australia and Japan took the 
initiative this week in New York to jointly host a cross-
regional meeting of Foreign Ministers, with the aim of 
working towards the implementation of those 64 
actions. The potential catastrophe of nuclear conflict 
means that the status quo is not an option. We must 
move ahead with the negotiation of a fissile material 
cut-off treaty, and we must ensure that the United 
Nations disarmament machinery is doing its job. 
 On the wider question of security, the Australian 
Government, under Prime Minister Gillard, warmly 
welcomes the statement to this Assembly by the 
President of the United States concerning his efforts to 
achieve a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in 
the Middle East (see ). Australia’s position 
remains constant: such a settlement must allow both 
Israel and a future Palestinian State to live side by side 
in peace and security. Australia calls on all parties to 
put their shoulders to the wheel, to seize the historic 
opportunity that now presents itself to bring about a 
lasting peace. All States members of the General 
Assembly should welcome the prospect of both an 
Israeli and a Palestinian State being represented at the 
sixty-sixth session of the Assembly, to be held next 
year. 
  
 
10-55103 42 
 
 Over the past several years, Australia has 
promoted the concept of an Asia-Pacific community 
involving the active membership in the future 
architecture of our region of both the United States and 
the Russian Federation. Australia therefore welcomes 
the imminent membership of the United States and 
Russia in the East Asia Summit. The East Asia Summit 
leaders will take this historic decision in Hanoi in 
October. Australia, as a founding member of the East 
Asia Summit, looks forward to contributing to the 
evolution of this wider sense of community across this, 
the most dynamic region of the world. 
 On questions of wider human security, Australia 
remains fully engaged on international and regional 
challenges, including irregular movements of people, 
organized crime and people-smuggling. 
 The most immediate and pressing threat to the 
physical security of Australia’s wider region lies in the 
scourge of natural disasters. The Asia-Pacific region 
has seen tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes and floods 
on a massive scale. Australia proposes that the 
international community consider afresh our capacity 
to respond rapidly, coherently and proportionately to 
large-scale natural disasters. 
 Within our own region, Australia argues that this 
would also represent an effective benefit to the peoples 
and countries of our region, which are particularly 
prone to natural disasters. It would also in time 
constitute a valuable confidence- and security-building 
measure among the armed forces, emergency services 
and security agencies of the various nation-States of 
the Asia Pacific. The magnitude of what I witnessed 
last week when I was in Pakistan underlines the 
importance of better planning, preparation and 
coordination to deal with natural disasters on a mass 
scale. We cannot afford simply to wait for another such 
disaster to occur before realizing that the resources of 
the United Nations and its agencies are simply 
incapable of meeting challenges of such an order of 
magnitude. 
 The challenges to global economic stability 
remain significant. The full impact of the global 
financial crisis is not yet clear. There are still systemic 
problems within the global financial system. These 
must be dealt with through the appropriate national and 
international institutions if we are to remove the 
underlying causes of the crisis that began in the United 
States in September 2008 and then proceeded to ravage 
the economies and the working people of the world. 
 Beyond the specific reforms necessary in the 
global financial system, the parallel problem of global 
financial imbalances must also be addressed. These 
have formed part of the Group of 20 (G-20) agenda, in 
which Australia is active. The objectives of the 
Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced 
Growth agreed to by the G-20 States at their Pittsburgh 
summit in September 2009 remain essential and must 
be implemented if we are to act on the causes of the 
recent crisis. 
 Last December, the nations of the world 
assembled in Copenhagen for the Conference of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Australia was an 
active participant at Copenhagen. Together with a 
number of other States, Australia worked tirelessly to 
produce the Copenhagen Accord. The Accord did not 
represent all that the international community needed 
then in order to bring about a comprehensive response 
to the continuing challenge of climate change. It did, 
however, represented four significant advances. 
 For the first time, the Accord entrenched 2°C or 
less as the limit beyond which global temperatures 
could not be allowed to rise in order to avoid 
irretrievable climate change for the planet. 
 For the first time, both developed and developing 
countries accepted that they had responsibilities to 
bring about this outcome. 
 For the first time, developed and developing 
countries agreed to develop a framework for the 
measurement, reporting and verification of mitigation 
actions. 
 And for the first time, developed countries 
committed themselves to mobilizing an amount 
approaching $30 billion in international public 
financing for immediate action in developing countries 
to 2012, and to work towards a goal of mobilizing 
$100 billion annually by 2020 in funding from all 
sources. 
 Much, however, remains to be done. Australia 
believes the international community must urgently 
address the particular climate-change adaptation needs 
of the world’s most vulnerable States, in particular the 
island countries of the Pacific, the Caribbean and the 
Indian Ocean. 
 
 
43 10-55103 
 
 One significant area of progress in the period 
ahead lies in the proper protection, preservation and 
reforestation of the world’s rainforests. Collectively, 
rainforest degradation and deforestation in developing 
countries represents about one fifth of global 
greenhouse gas emissions. Australia stands ready to act 
with other States, including Norway, to build on the 
work already done, in order to achieve an effective 
outcome in this area as rapidly as possible. The 
international community needs to see an early sign of 
real success in our international efforts to combat 
climate change. We believe that action on rainforests, 
through what is called the REDD-plus set of 
initiatives — on reducing emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation in developing countries — 
represents one such area of possible early advance. 
 Australia is now active on both the Secretary-
General’s High-level Panels, on global sustainability 
and on climate change finance. This, added to our 
continued participation in the UNFCCC, means that 
Australia will continue to be among the most globally 
active States in global forums for bringing about a 
comprehensive and effective global response to climate 
change. In doing so, the Governments of the world will 
have to closely consider new growth models that 
incorporate both the concept and the reality of lower-
carbon economies. 
 For the economies of the world, this 
transformation — which some have called the next 
industrial revolution — also represents an 
unprecedented opportunity for investment and 
employment as the global economy embraces new 
efficiency measures and new renewable energy 
strategies. The international community needs to 
embrace a new way of looking at climate change, 
which sees action on climate change providing new 
industries, new investment and new job opportunities 
for the future. 
 All Governments represented in the Assembly 
participated in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Australia 
fully embraces the MDG framework. 
 This week, in New York, we said that our aid 
programme has doubled over the last five years and is 
projected to double again by 2015. Over time, more of 
our aid will go to the least developed countries, and we 
will continue to give high priority to assisting the 
world’s small island States, particularly our Pacific 
neighbours, in recognition of their special needs. 
 We expect to invest some $5 billion in education 
by 2015, including support for universal primary 
education. Australia also expects to invest at least 
$1.6 billion in women’s and children’s health up to 
2015. 
 Australia applauds the initiative to create a new 
institution entitled UN Women, under the capable 
leadership of the new Under-Secretary-General, 
Michelle Bachelet, former President of Chile. Australia 
looks forward to working with UN Women on the vast 
array of challenges which half of humanity faces and 
for which our existing international frameworks have 
been found wanting. The education of women and girls 
and the security of women and girls from violence and 
sexual abuse and exploitation must now become a core 
part of our global campaign for a fairer world. 
 Human rights abuses and humanitarian crises in 
failing States continue to plague us. We must enhance 
the negotiations on the responsibility to protect and 
support the mandate of the International Criminal 
Court. We must also continue to speak out against 
flagrant abuses. 
 Often it is the indigenous peoples of the world 
who suffer most. I am proud of Australia’s apology to 
our own indigenous peoples and our policy of closing 
the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous 
Australians. I am also proud of Australia’s support for 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
Australia is making a major effort in the treatment of 
our indigenous peoples, although we still have a long 
way to go. 
 Australia is a founding Member of the United 
Nations. We have been active in this institution for the 
last 65 years. 
 We are also a candidate for the Security Council 
for the 2013-2014 term. Australia has contributed 
65,000 of our number to 52 different peacekeeping 
missions across the world. We remain active in several 
such peace operations today, including in Cyprus, 
Sudan, Timor-Leste and Afghanistan. 
 Over the years, Australia has a led a number of 
significant United Nations initiatives, including the 
Cambodia peace settlement and the conclusion of the 
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and the Chemical 
Weapons Convention, as well as leading the force that 
  
 
10-55103 44 
 
stabilized Timor-Leste after its people voted for 
independence. 
 Australia remains intimately engaged in all the 
funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the 
United Nations. We are also active in other 
international institutions, including the 
Commonwealth. 
 Australia is the twelfth largest source of funding 
for the United Nations budget. Australia pays in full 
and on time. We always seek to do that which we say 
we will do. 
 Australia wants to be part of the solution to the 
many challenges that the international community now 
faces, not just point to the problems. Australia believes 
in the power of creative ideas and active diplomacy to 
solve long-standing international problems. Australia 
values good international citizenship. It is for these 
reasons that Australia has been committed to the 
United Nations since the very beginning. 
 The United Nations is inevitably imperfect. As 
the Organization’s second Secretary-General — the 
great Swede, Dag Hammarskjöld — famously said, 
“The United Nations was not created in order to bring 
us to heaven, but in order to save us from hell”. 
 Our responsibility today is to fulfil the vision that 
our forebears had for this great institution 65 years 
ago. Our responsibility is to make the United Nations 
fulfil its mission — to make the United Nations work 
through the combined political will of all Member 
States."
2358,65,2010,PLW,"Last September, I had the 
privilege of addressing this Assembly for the first time 
as Palau’s Head of State (see A/64/PV.7). It is an 
honour for me to do so once again this year. 
 Palau’s national story is one of achievement and 
success. Palau was the last country to emerge from 
United Nations trusteeship. The Constitution of our 
new country incorporated the rights and freedoms 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and is a testament to the efficacy of the United 
Nations. The United Nations also helped us form a 
strong partnership with the United States of America, 
our former Administering Authority. This partnership 
was renewed on 3 September when the United States 
and Palau entered into a new agreement that will assist 
Palau in its efforts to achieve economic self-
sufficiency, and for this we express our profound 
gratitude to the United States of America. 
 Palau is also proud of our role in the international 
community, joining international conventions and 
meeting our international obligations. Our officers are 
helping to maintain peace in fragile States. We have 
deployed peacekeepers to Darfur, Timor-Leste and 
Solomon Islands. 
 For Palau, environmental sustainability is not a 
recent construct. Respect for the environment and its 
preservation is Palau’s most deeply ingrained tradition 
and is at the heart of our culture. Palauans have always 
known that caring for the long-term health of the 
environment is the foundation of our progress and 
survival. 
 With our traditions as our bedrock, I am pleased 
to say that Palau has virtually achieved our Millennium 
Development Goal (MDG) targets, according to the 
United Nations-sanctioned report. Palau has succeeded 
in achieving universal literacy, gender equality, 
maternal health and access to education. We have 
eliminated poverty and hunger and reduced child 
mortality to a degree comparable to even the most 
advanced developed countries. We thank, among 
others, our closest friends and allies: first the United 
States, then Japan and the Republic of China on Taiwan 
for helping us reach this point.  
 We consider the MDGs to be a minimum, and we 
will continue to strive for higher goals, including the 
goal of combating the ever-increasing spread of non-
communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart 
disease and obesity, which the Pacific Islands Health 
Officers Association has declared a regional epidemic 
in the Pacific. 
 We are a small country, but blessed in many 
ways. I reiterate that we have risen to achieve the 
MDGs by caring for our God-given resources. We have 
put in place a system domestically to conserve and 
preserve our terrestrial and marine biodiversity. We 
have also joined with our Pacific neighbours to address 
the health of our oceans together through the Pacific 
Oceanscape programme.

 Palau, and indeed the entire world, is connected 
by a web of life that is in peril. For too long, we have 
focused our attention primarily on commercial 
interests. We have abused nature and must change our 
thinking. We must reorient our priorities to put 
biodiversity and the welfare of our ecosystems first. In 
so doing, we can serve both our long-term commercial 
interests and protect the natural bounty that sustains us. 
 One issue that symbolizes the threat to our 
biodiversity succinctly is the fight to conserve our 
oceans. Last year, I declared the world’s first shark 
sanctuary from this podium. It was a good first step. I 
also advocated for an end to unsustainable, cruel and 
wasteful shark finning on the high seas at the resumed 
Review Conference on the United Nations Fish Stocks 
Agreement. We cannot accept the loss of 73 million 
sharks a year for a pot of soup. 
 Palau is doing all it can, but this work cannot stop 
at the boundary of any one country. We are all 
connected. This is why I am proud that President Lobo 
Sosa of Honduras and I signed this week a joint 
declaration calling on all other nations to stop 
unsustainable shark fishing. 
 Moreover, according to scientific studies, such as 
that entitled “Patterns and ecosystem consequences of 
shark declines in the ocean”, the health of sharks is 
linked directly to the health of tuna. Palau and other 
countries rely on tuna as their principal fisheries 
resource, and the world community relies on it as an 
important food source. We must work together to 
ensure the continued viability of this important stock. 
This past year, I hosted a summit of the parties to the 
Nauru Agreement to take steps to ensure that tuna 
remains plentiful. Along with other leaders of countries 
parties to the Naura Agreement, we limited purse seine 
fishing, agreed to close the doughnut holes between 
our jurisdictions, and implemented a vessel day 
scheme. These are steps which we believe are vital to 
ensuring the continued viability of our stocks. 
 When Palau and other Pacific small island 
developing States (SIDs) joined together at the sixty-
third session of the General Assembly to initiate 
resolution 63/281, “Climate change and its possible 
security implications”, we did so recognizing that not 
only is climate change a development issue, but has 
now risen to the level of a security issue. The 
successful adoption of resolution 63/281 by consensus 
was a landmark occasion for Pacific SIDs and a step 
forward for the international community. The 
accelerating conflict and dislocation caused by climate 
events warrant an urgent response from the Security 
Council. We repeat our call for Security Council action 
on this resolution. 
 After personally visiting the Pacific islands 
earlier this year, His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin 
Zayed Al Nahyan, Foreign Minister of the United Arab 
Emirates, convened an historic summit between the 
Arab League and the Pacific SIDs. The summit was a 
success. Our two regions, which had never before 
engaged bilaterally, found a new understanding of 
shared goals, culture and traditions. Palau is grateful to 
the League of Arab States for being the first regional 
group to recognize the potential of the Pacific SIDs as 
a strong, viable and cohesive unit. 
 We are hopeful that this is the year when we will 
make substantive progress on Security Council reform. 
Our position on the issue has been stated clearly and 
continually in the negotiation room. If we as an 
organization are to maintain our relevance, we must 
reform the Council so that its membership reflects the 
ever-evolving membership of the General Assembly. 
Palau strongly supports expanding Security Council 
membership, particularly by adding Japan as a 
permanent member. 
 On the issue of security, Palau is hopeful that the 
return of Israelis and Palestinians this month to the 
negotiating table will bear fruit. The crucible of the 
world’s Abrahamic faiths should not be the land of so 
much turmoil. The resolution of this intractable 
problem is of the utmost importance so that the region 
and its reality may reflect its historic message of peace 
on Earth. Palau can only add its voice to the chorus of 
support for a just, comprehensive and regional solution 
in accordance with the Road Map, the Arab Peace 
Initiative and the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
We welcome the opportunity to actively support the 
process in the General Assembly this fall. Indeed, 
world peace hinges on peace in the Middle East. 
 Palau also supports the efforts of the international 
community on disarmament and the prevention of the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Palau’s was the 
world’s first nuclear-free Constitution, and so the 
elimination of nuclear weapons is of special concern to 
us. Having experienced the horror and devastation of 
war, we and our neighbours long for the day when the 
entire world is free of nuclear weapons. We therefore 
  
 
10-54959 20 
 
welcome all efforts to add the Middle East to the list of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones. 
 The SARS pandemic shone a bright light on the 
gaps in our collective ability to prevent the spread of 
diseases internationally. With the participation of 
Taiwan, we can now help to fill those gaps. We 
congratulate the world community on making itself 
healthier by granting Taiwan observer status at the 
World Health Assembly. Given the importance of a 
universal approach to global problems, Palau advocates 
for Taiwan’s inclusion in the activities of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization and the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. The world needs its input to ensure civil 
aviation safety and security, and to effectively tackle 
climate change for the benefit of all. 
 When I began my address, I related the success 
story that was Palau’s emergence from trusteeship. As I 
wind down my remarks, I will speak candidly about 
our challenges. Today, Palau still feels the pain from 
the wounds inflicted during our colonial days. Damage 
was done to our islands. One, for example, was 
stripped of much of its resources, making it difficult 
for those who live there to sustain the livelihood they 
once enjoyed. This happened to our once phosphate-
rich island of Angaur. We call on the international 
community for appropriate relief for this historic and 
lasting injury — a relief that will heal the gaping 
wounds on our island, ease our pain and bring justice 
to our people. 
 In addition, as a result of the fierce battles fought 
over our islands during the Second World War, 
explosives were rained down on our land. Some of 
those explosives still lie there, live, and pose an 
extreme danger to the lives and limbs of our people. 
We appeal to the conscience of the world, especially 
those responsible, to remove this danger from our 
midst. 
 As a developing nation, Palau is thankful for the 
grants provided to us by our allies, friends and 
partners. They have been invaluable. But our 
developing economy faces a crisis that grants alone 
cannot address. Without a strong local economy based 
on private enterprise and the free market, our young 
people will continue to leave our shores to pursue 
better employment abroad. We need more than just 
humanitarian grants; we need private investment to 
spur and sustain our economic development. I therefore 
invite investors and entrepreneurs from all over the 
world to come to Palau to invest and establish 
partnerships with our talented people, so that we can 
create a vibrant economy for now and for our future."
2404,65,2010,KIR,"Every year, we gather in this 
General Assembly Hall to take stock of our 
achievements in the pursuit of a more peaceful, more 
secure and a better world for all citizens of the global 
community. 
 As it emerged from the ashes of devastating 
world wars, the United Nations heralded a new era and 
a new world order of international cooperation in the 
pursuit of international peace and security. It is 
premised on the principles of sovereign equality and 
peaceful coexistence. 
 Taking stock of what we have achieved since 
then, we can say today that we have been successful in 
preventing many of the scourges that have challenged 
humanity, including world wars and widespread 
disease. But as we rid our global society of those 
injustices, new and emerging forms of injustices now 
threaten our global security. 
 I believe that climate change remains the greatest 
moral challenge of our time. While it affects all nations 
of this planet, the irony is that it is the poorest and 
smallest countries, which have made the least 
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, that are 
paying the ultimate price in order that the lifestyles and 
development agenda of some countries may be 
maintained. Where is the justice in that? 
 The Copenhagen Conference failed to meet the 
expectations of many, but especially of those countries 
on the front line for which the threat of climate change 
is no longer a matter of speculation but one of survival, 
and therefore of great urgency. There is a tendency in 
much of the world to view climate change as a distant 
and gradual process whose harmful effects are remote 
possible and not worthy of much attention. I have said 
in various forums that, for low-lying island countries 
like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and the Marshall 
Islands, among other similarly vulnerable countries, 
climate change is a matter of survival and of increasing 
urgency. 
 Already we are witnessing major damage to 
infrastructure and property as a consequence of higher-
than-normal tides and storm surges. Coastal erosion in 
heavily populated areas is occurring at a rate that 
exceeds the Governments’ capacity to respond. Lack of 
resources is exacerbating the situation. Coastlines 
continue to be eroded and homes and properties 
continue to be damaged. 
 Long before our islands are inundated by the 
rising seas, they will become uninhabitable as 
freshwater aquifers are contaminated by saltwater 
intrusion from rising tides. Increasing demand for 
resources to undertake effective responses to climate 
change impacts will become a dominant feature of our 
development agenda. I truly hope, therefore, that I can 
during this session communicate the deep sense of 
urgency and growing sense of despair besetting our 
people in the face of this oncoming catastrophe. 
 On the basis of current scientific projections, the 
Copenhagen Accord does not provide the means to 
guarantee our future survival, and therefore we did not 
sign it in Copenhagen. We have subsequently 
associated ourselves with the Accord, essentially for 
the following reasons. First, we are of the belief that 
the Accord at least represents a positive step towards 
 
 
7 10-55109 
 
an international governance system on climate change. 
Secondly, we have the expectation that further, 
forthcoming scientific evidence will unequivocally 
determine the targets to be agreed upon. Finally and 
most importantly, we believe that our support for the 
Accord will ensure the flow of urgently needed 
adaptation funds. I regret to say that, to date, we have 
not been able to access any of the fast-start funds 
pledged. 
 I acknowledge that many elements of any 
international regime on climate change will take 
several years to conclude, but I also believe that there 
is common ground on which there is no real debate. 
The urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to 
address the more urgent adaptation needs of the most 
vulnerable countries is a matter over which there is 
general consensus. It is not a matter to negotiate or 
procrastinate over; if we do, it will be too late for some 
countries and any subsequent agreement will be 
meaningless. It is also important that adaptation funds 
not be regarded as additional development funds by 
either development partners or recipient countries, but 
be provided and applied for the sole purpose of 
adaptation to climate change. 
 I believe that we need to modify our approach to 
Mexico if we are to succeed. I believe that we have a 
moral obligation to reach agreement on a legally 
binding framework that regulates our ability to pursue 
policies that harm others. For very obvious reasons, I 
do not believe that any country should have the right to 
exercise sovereignty over its greenhouse gas emissions. 
In my view, any alternative to a legally binding 
framework is simply unacceptable and would have 
potentially destabilizing consequences. 
 The experience at Copenhagen taught us that if 
we are to make any progress, we must acknowledge 
our differences and discuss ways around them rather 
than allow them to dominate the international agenda 
behind the process. In this regard, we believe that trust 
and mutual respect are indispensable to the process. 
 Climate change offers the international 
community an opportunity to reflect upon the future 
direction of our relations as sovereign nations. I 
believe that the climate change challenge provides us 
with the opportunity to be more innovative in our 
concept of international governance. Our current 
arrangement is similar to that of State Governments not 
accepting federal authority within a federal system. 
One can imagine the chaos. 
 While other countries are focusing their efforts 
and resources on their sustainable development, we, 
the most vulnerable countries, continue to spend the 
limited resources we have on fighting the continuous 
onslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on our 
homes and livelihoods. It is no surprise therefore that 
we are off-track to achieve most of the Millennium 
Development Goals and the implementation of our 
sustainable development agenda under our national 
development plan, the Pacific Plan and the Mauritius 
Strategy. For every step we take forward, we are 
knocked back two or three due to the challenges we 
face, which are exacerbated by climate change. 
 In this regard, it is imperative that the pledges 
made at Copenhagen for fast-start funds to assist 
vulnerable countries like Kiribati to adapt to the impact 
of climate change and sea-level rise be mobilized at the 
earliest possible opportunity. This is a matter of great 
and increasing urgency. 
 We acknowledge the critical role of our 
environment as the pillar of sustainable development. 
Maintaining the health of our biodiversity within our 
oceans and ecosystems faces the very same challenges 
that we have so far failed to address in respect of our 
atmosphere. It is imperative, therefore, that we 
undertake the commitment to put in place now the 
measures needed in order to avoid the mistakes we 
have made with climate change. In pursuit of this, we 
in Kiribati have designated the largest marine protected 
area and marine World Heritage Site, the Phoenix 
Islands Protected Area. It covers an area of more than 
400,000 square kilometres, representing some 11 per 
cent of our exclusive economic zone. The Protected 
Area is the result of a collaborative partnership with 
Conservation International and the New England 
Aquarium. It provides a natural breeding ground for 
tropical fisheries and ocean ecosystems. It is a natural 
laboratory for the study of such ecosystems and the 
impact of climate change in a pristine area virtually 
untouched by human activity. 
 The preservation of that Area is our gift to 
humanity and our contribution to international 
biodiversity conservation efforts to significantly reduce 
biodiversity loss in this International Year of 
Biodiversity. Even now, as we confront the possibility 
that our islands will become uninhabitable within the 
  
 
10-55109 8 
 
century due to the rising sea level, we recognize the 
value of protecting something that is the common 
heritage of humanity. 
 Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to the 
sustainable conservation and management of their 
ocean ecosystem through the Micronesia Challenge, 
the Coral Triangle Initiative, the Nauru Agreement and 
the many other national efforts throughout the region 
to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. At its meeting 
last month in Vanuatu, the Pacific Islands Forum 
endorsed the Pacific Oceanscape Framework, which 
promotes collaboration and cooperation among marine 
protected areas in the Pacific region. Initiatives such as 
the Pacific 2020 Challenge and a novel Pangaea World 
concept of green development through knowledge 
economies link those initiatives to the countries of the 
Pacific Rim and beyond. 
 Our message to the international community is 
that the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems in 
the Pacific is not important only to the sustainable 
development of Pacific peoples. It is also of vital 
significance to the rest of the world. Support from the 
international community in protecting ecosystems in 
the Pacific, and indeed elsewhere, should not be 
viewed as a handout, but as an investment for future 
generations of this planet. 
 Last year, we all called for a new world order. We 
all acknowledged that our great Organization must 
evolve to reflect the realities of our time — a time in 
which new and emerging security threats and injustices 
such as climate change are challenging the credibility 
of our international system of governance; a time in 
which the future survival of some nations is seriously 
in question; a time when all those countries with the 
ability to do so must contribute to the prevention of 
that calamity or be forever judged in history. 
 We note that tensions remain high in certain 
regions, notably in the Middle East and the Korean 
peninsula. For the sake of those of us on the front line 
of the major global challenges, let us pray that great 
understanding and stability will prevail. For while we, 
as small nations, may seem not to be affected by such 
events, they serve to distract the focus of attention 
away from the real challenges facing the international 
community and our planet today. 
 It is gratifying to note the easing of tensions and 
improvement of relations across the Taiwan Straits — 
no doubt, a most welcome development for all in that 
region. We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the 
World Health Assembly, and we hope that similar 
understanding will prevail in respect of other 
international institutions in which Taiwan can 
participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of 
humanity. 
 As we chart the path towards a new world order, 
we must address the fundamental threats to the very 
existence of the units that make up our Organization. 
As the so called community of nations, we must be 
able to guarantee the survival of members of our 
community by addressing this defining challenge of 
our era. Climate change must be addressed before it is 
too late for those nations on the front line and for the 
whole of humanity. 
 At this time, we need compassionate, visionary 
and responsible leadership to direct our path towards a 
more secure and more just world. We need to share the 
solution, and we need to act as one in Mexico. We owe 
it to our future generations to act, and to act now. 
Maintaining the status quo is simply not an option. "
2409,39,1984,NZL,"﻿Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election. When Africa's problems are looming so large, it is appropriate that an African should once again preside over the General Assembly. We are confident that your presidency will help make this session a fruitful one. New Zealand will do all it can to assist you.
3.	We welcome the newest Member of the United Nations, Brunei Darussalam, a country of our own part of the world, with which we have long-standing ties. New Zealand has long believed that the membership of the Organization should be universal. We welcome every step in that direction. We would not want to see the principle of universality compromised in any way.
4.	I would not adequately reflect the views of most New Zealanders if I did not, right at the beginning of my first address to the General Assembly, talk about an issue that has become very prominent in public debate in our country. New Zealanders—not just a few of them, but people from all sectors of the community—have become gravely concerned about nuclear weapons and the continuing and deadly competition in their production, their refinement and their deployment.
5.	New Zealand is a small and remote country, perhaps a little distant from the mainstream of world affairs. We are fortunate enough to live in a region that constitutes a pocket of tranquillity in a deeply divided and troubled world. Like many members of the international community, New Zealand faces serious economic problems and some social ones as well; but we are at least able to come to grips with these problems without having our attention diverted by those immediate worries out security that are all too familiar for many Members of the United Nations. We are not occupied; we are nobody's client; we have excellent relations with all our neighbours; in 1984 no other country has New Zealand in its sights. For our longer-term protection we rely on our membership of the Western Alliance. That membership is formally expressed in a security treaty with the United States and Australia which for 33 years has been a central feature of the foreign and defence policies of successive New Zealand Governments, including my own.
6.	Against this background, why is it that New Zealanders are becoming increasingly worried about a contest that is centred in two capitals half a world away? With no more immodesty than many others, New Zealanders like to think of themselves as practical and sensible people. They are simply alarmed at the continuing build-up of nuclear arsenals, because they can see no sense in it. How does it make sense continually to augment and refine an existing capacity to make the rubble bounce and bounce and bounce again? New Zealanders have felt deepening frustration at the inability of the States that hold nuclear weapons, in particular the two super-Powers, to agree on practical measures to halt and reverse the process of building more and 'better' nuclear weapons. If ordinary people everywhere can see the irrationality of that race, they ask, why cannot the super-Powers see it also? And, if they can see it, why do they not do something about it?
7.	Quite recently, another dimension has been added to these concerns. Our people, like others round the world, have known for a long time that the possibility of nuclear war is a terrible and frightening one. They have known for very many years that if the countries that have these weapons eventually descend to hurling them at each other, then those countries and their peoples will be destroyed. They have also recognized that other countries, including New Zealand, would suffer very severely indeed. But New Zealanders had not previously supposed that the direct physical consequences for them could be overwhelming. If common humanity and concern for others dictated anxiety about nuclear war, it was thought, perhaps we could afford to be slightly less anxious than others.
8.	Within the last year or so, New Zealanders have been told that even that last tattered shred of reassurance is probably no longer available. Reputable scientists from east and west have told us that the global, climatic and long-term biological consequences of a nuclear war would be much more severe than had been previously thought. What is more, that would be the case if even a relatively small part of existing nuclear arsenals was used or if the weapons were used only against so-called counter-force or military targets. The scientists have also told us that nuclear war in the north may generate a nuclear winter in the south as well. They have gone further and advised us that there is a possibility of the self- inflicted extinction of the human species. That, we are told, is what could flow from the deliberate, if irrational, act, the mistake, the miscalculation or the accident.
9.	To New Zealanders this is a truly appalling state of affairs. Refinements or modifications of the predictions which the scientists have made about the consequences of nuclear war may be made as a result of further work, but they will concern only the exact range of utter disaster.
10.	What the scientists have already made entirely plain to all of us—plainer than ever before—is that the nuclear weapons that may have helped to maintain an uneasy peace between two great countries for more than three decades have become a threat to the security and survival of countries and peoples everywhere. The situation we are facing is quite unlike any other with which the international community has had to grapple before. It is one from which, unpalatable though it may be to think about, no country— and, for that matter, no individual—can back away. We shall not escape from it if the traditional prescriptions of great-Power politics are applied.
11.	What the scientists have not demonstrated, of course, is that nuclear war will occur or that it is more likely now than it was in the past. But the question how close we may be to falling into the abyss does not take account of the essential point. The fact is that a nuclear war is possible, whether it is half a year or 100 years away or whether, as we all hope, it never occurs.
12.	None of the nuclear-weapon States can tell us that it will not occur, that they will never do what they have in their power to do. The results of the use of nuclear weapons would be so grave that it is absolutely incumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States to do everything possible to avoid their use. And that would remain the case even if the consequences of nuclear war should be shown later to be only half or a quarter as bad as the scientists have predicted.
13.	My Government can find no encouragement in the recent response of the nuclear-weapon States to this situation. The refinement and deployment of nuclear weapons continues apace. There are disquieting indications that the military competition between the super-Powers may, in the coming years, move to the new environment of outer space. Multilateral arms control negotiations are stalled and, in some cases, in danger of being discredited. I would ask the Soviet Union to respond positively to the United States invitation to resume key bilateral arms control talks in order to get a dialogue under way again.
14.	My Government hopes that the two super-Powers will take a long hard look at the course of developments in the nuclear arms race. It is clearly in their own interests and in the interests of all of us to make a new and very much more determined attempt to reach agreements that will enable them to change direction. None of us underestimates the complexities involved in reaching agreements that will permit a mutual, balanced, verifiable—and very large—reduction in existing levels of nuclear weapons. We are aware that it will not be easy to manage safely the transition to a more secure world where, as a stage in the road to their elimination, the number of nuclear weapons is drastically reduced and where innovations in weaponry, if they are to occur at all, are not of a kind that cause instability. That process will require trust and good will. It is also likely to require the taking of risks. But the most dangerous risk of all is to do nothing: to allow compulsive competitiveness to continue indefinitely.
15.	We ask, in addition, of the Soviet Union that it reflect on the fact that many countries, of which New Zealand is one, have the greatest difficulty in under-standing its current reluctance to take part in bilateral arms control negotiations with the United States. The events that occurred between 1939 and 1945 gave the Soviet Union every reason to be concerned about preserving the peace. It will advance that cause by returning to the bargaining table and looking at ways and means of beginning the process of de-escalation.
16.	Countries such as my own have to recognize that the contribution we can make to assist this process is limited; but we are bound to continue to try. There are several things we want to emphasize. The most urgent of these is the need for massive reductions in strategic nuclear arms. There are other things as well. New Zealand has, for many years, argued the case for the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
17.	It needs to be understood that our advocacy of that measure is not prompted solely by the fact that one of the nuclear-weapon States continues, despite repeated pleas from all the countries in the region, to test its weapons in the South Pacific. We see a prohibition of the testing of nuclear weapons by any country in any environment as a critical first step in halting and then turning back the arms race. We have been disappointed at the lack of progress made in securing such a prohibition. My delegation will again at this session of the General Assembly sponsor a draft resolution which seeks to encourage and speed up that work.
18.	A comprehensive test ban will also be of the greatest importance in preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. Everything possible must be done to stop that from happening. My Government will want to take an active part in the Third Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons next year. We see that Treaty as fundamental to world security.
19.	There are, of course, other techniques of modern warfare which are not much less unpleasant than nuclear weapons. Biological weapons have already been outlawed. The need for a comprehensive agreement to outlaw the manufacture and use of all chemical weapons is another matter of concern to New Zealand. During the past year there appears to have been some prospect of progress in that direction. We urge the Conference on Disarmament to get on with the task.
20.	If the international community is to chart a way out of the current impasse on nuclear weapons, this will be done through global measures in which the nuclear-weapon States will play the major role. But regional initiatives can also make a contribution. My Government regards the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) as a significant regional advance. We are also fully committed to, and will vigorously defend, the Antarctic Treaty, which demilitarized a whole continent to the south of New Zealand and prohibited the basing or testing of nuclear weapons and which, for more than 20 years, has effectively guaranteed the stability of that region.
21.	Very recently, a new initiative has been taken in our part of the world. On the proposal of Australia and with the full support of my Government, the heads of Government of the 11 countries that make up the South Pacific Forum agreed on 28 August of this year, at a meeting in Tuvalu, on the desirability of establishing a South Pacific nuclear-free zone at the earliest opportunity. The heads of Government spelt out the principles that will be applied in the construction of such a zone. It was agreed that there should be no use, testing or stationing of nuclear devices in the South Pacific; that no South Pacific country would develop or manufacture or receive from others or acquire or test any nuclear explosive device; and that nuclear activities in the South Pacific would be conducted in accordance with applicable international principles and treaties, notably the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The meeting acknowledged the need for a South Pacific nuclear-free zone to respect the principles of freedom of navigation and overflight. It was accepted that South Pacific countries would retain their unqualified sovereign right to decide for themselves, consistent with the objectives of the zone, on their security arrangements and on such questions as the access to their ports and airfields by vessels and aircraft of other countries. It was agreed that in the course of the next year a draft of a treaty to establish the zone should be prepared.
22.	This initiative represents, I believe, a major advance for the region. It would net, we know, spare us from the consequences of nuclear war but, when in place, it would significantly strengthen the existing measures, both global and regional, to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It would also, I believe, convey a clear signal that the South Pacific countries do not want their region to become an arena for rivalry involving nuclear weapons.
23.	New Zealand would hope to be in a position to report to the General Assembly next year and, before that, to the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that good progress has been made in creating a South Pacific nuclear-free zone. New Zealand and the other countries of our region naturally expect that, when the necessary work has been done within the region, all the nuclear-weapon States will co-operate with us to ensure that the zone becomes a reality.
24.	The recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum turned its attention also to the evolving situation in New Caledonia.
25.	The question is not really where that Territory is going. Rather, it is how it gets there, and at what pace. The French Government has, I believe, made a clear and irreversible commitment to self-determination for the peoples of New Caledonia. There is a particular mix of interests and problems that must be resolved carefully and by the people most directly concerned, that is to say, by all the ethnic groups that have a legitimate stake in the future of New Caledonia.
26.	All members of the Forum agreed that the changes that are to come in New Caledonia—and they must and will come—should be made speedily and peacefully, that is to say, without violence and without external interference. It is up to all parties concerned to exercise moderation. They must work together to achieve the kind of political future that satisfies the demands of a truly democratic and harmonious multi-ethnic society in New Caledonia.
27.	A significant amount of progress has been made. A lot remains to be done. That was recognized at the Forum. There we were agreed that the process of decolonization would be advanced by a public statement from France about its commitment to independence for New Caledonia. We gave it as our view that the referendum planned for 1989 should be brought forward; 1989 was, we felt, too distant a date. And we suggested some intensification of preparation for the country's eventual independence to ensure the full and active participation of the Kanak people in the country's educational, vocational and administrative life.
28.	We called too, at that Forum, on the Independence Front to play its part in the early and peaceful evolution of New Caledonia to independence by recognizing the need for independence to reflect fully the multiracial nature of New Caledonia.
29.	What we stressed above all was the crucial role of dialogue—that those involved should keep talking to each other. That was the message which the Tuvalu Forum sought to convey to France and to the Independence Front. I am hopeful that an initiative taken by the Forum to foster the process of dialogue will soon get under way and that a group of Ministers from Forum countries—including New Zealand— will be able to talk to the leaders of the Independence Front and to the French Government to tell each of them about the concern of the countries in our part of the world that New Caledonia should move through conference and dialogue, not through confrontation and dispute, to independence. We in the South Pacific have always found solutions to problems through dialogue, discussion, consensus; and it is through dialogue and consensus that we wish to see New Caledonia take its rightful place soon in the community of the nations of the South Pacific.
30.	Neither we nor our South Pacific partners want to see unwelcome external influences intrude upon events of New Caledonia, nor to see the transition to independence marred by an outcome that is not in accordance with the wishes of all those in New Caledonia who have made that country their permanent home. Our part of the world has been fortunate in that it has been free from the conflict and violence that have so often accompanied decolonization elsewhere. We do not want that record to be blemished. I am confident that it will not be.
31.	If it is important to all of us living in the South Pacific that our region remain free from conflict, we are equally concerned to ensure that our backyard, the Antarctic, does not become an area of international rivalry and discord. I have already noted that the Antarctic Treaty demilitarized Antarctica. What is even more important, the Treaty provides the only possible guarantee that the region will continue to be free from international rivalry and conflict. The study on the question of Antarctica, submitted by the Secretary-General should help countries more remote from the region to understand the contribution the Treaty has made and continues to make to the achievement of the purposes of the United Nations. I hope it will convince them that the Treaty system, which is open to all Members of the United Nations, must be preserved and strengthened.
32.	I referred a moment ago to a conviction that there has been an irrevocable commitment to self- determination for the people of New Caledonia. I wish I could say the same about the situation in southern Africa. Namibia continues to be unlawfully occupied by South Africa. The United Nations has had no choice but itself to accept a special responsibility for the Territory. It has guaranteed to its people that they will be able to exercise their right of self- determination. But that promise has been subverted by South Africa's determination to accept no settlement except on its own terms, and by the military power which reinforces the obstinacy and aggression that South Africa has also shown towards its other neighbours.
33.	I wish, too, that it could be said that the agreements South Africa has recently concluded with neighbouring States signified a new era in the region. Regrettably, they do not appear to be agreements made willingly in order to resolve difficulties and develop closer working partnerships, or agreements in which peace and justice were equally sought by both sides.
34.	Nor can it be said that the South African Government has offered justice to the people of South Africa in its new constitutional arrangements. There is not the slightest indication that it is ready to share political power with the black majority. Nor is there any sign that it is willing to dismantle the system. The essence of that system is unchanged. In recent and separate elections the Coloured and Indian communities have spurned the South African Government's attempt to draw them into an alliance and, by so doing, have confirmed their rejection of the apartheid system.
35.	New Zealand likewise rejects apartheid and all it stands for. We are committed in our country to building a multiracial society based on freedom, justice and consent. The South Africans have already learned that my Government will not compromise with a system that rejects those values.
36.	If my Government believes that there is today more reason than ever before to keep the basic issue of war and peace right at the top of the agenda of the United Nations, we also see an urgent need to move quickly and firmly to tackle the economic problems facing the world.
37.	The world economy is just beginning to emerge from the worst trial it has known for over 30 years. Investment and production have increased, inflation is down and world trade is increasing. But doubts persist. Unhappily, even now many countries have yet to benefit significantly from the recovery in some of the leading industrial economies. The international financial system has shown enough flexibility to survive the recent crisis. That is a relief. But it is hard to feel very optimistic about the future when many countries are still struggling to meet their financial obligations and in many others large numbers of people are actually facing starvation.
38.	The protracted debates in international forums during the past few years have not done much to alleviate the real problems confronting us. New Zealand would like to encourage the development of a gradual movement towards pragmatism and compromise. New Zealanders have never seen much prospect of resolving the world's economic problems through confrontation. Dialogue and consensus are the techniques that we are trying to use in our own country, and they seem to us to hold out the best chance of success on the international scene.
39.	The recent economic crisis has had at least one good result. During the past year or so, it has become widely recognized among industrialized as well as developing countries that, despite the role that international financial institutions have played in supporting the adjustment and development efforts of individual countries, the present international system is not working well. If proof is still required it can easily be found in the debt problem, on the one hand, and the problem of protectionism, on the other. More and more, international trade is escaping the multilateral rules that should safeguard the interests of all countries, including the smaller among them. The need for an overhaul is pressing. The task now is to find the right technique for the job—that is, a technique that will work. New Zealand has been active in the search for an acceptable and effective procedure for dealing with the problem. New Zealand supports a comprehensive review of the trade and payments system.
40.	Before I finish I want to reaffirm my faith and my country's in the United Nations. Nowadays there are many people who question the usefulness of the Organization for their own countries if not for the world at large. I am not one of them. I believe that the Charter of the United Nations is the foundation of the system of international relations under which we have all lived for nearly 40 years. I believe that the essential function of the United Nations under the Charter is to discourage the use of force by one State against another. I believe that the Organization has played a part in saving us all so far from the catastrophe of a third world war. I belong to a generation in my country which has never experienced at first hand the ravages of war in the sense of the amount of fear that war brings, and throughout my lifetime the United Nations has symbolized, as it has coexisted with a level of peace for which we yearn, the fact that multilateral arrangements can be of benefit to the human race. I believe that the United Nations has an important contribution to make towards bringing the nuclear arms race under control and freeing us from the fear of nuclear war. I believe that I and all New Zealanders and our children can rest more peacefully because of the work that is done within the United Nations, and I believe that that is true for all peoples on our Earth.
"
2448,39,1984,PNG,"﻿I join previous speakers in extending to Mr. Lusaka my delegation's congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to express our appreciation of the exemplary manner in which his distinguished predecessor, Mr- Illueca, presided over the thirty-eighth session.
315.	On behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government, I extend a special welcome to Brunei Darussalam on its becoming a Member of the United Nations. As a neighbour in the region, Papua New Guinea has close ties with Brunei. Brunei and Papua New Guinea representatives sat together as special observers at the annual meetings of Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations before we decided to become a full member this year, and at the regional meetings of the Commonwealth Heads of Government.
316.	Many of the items on the agenda for this session of the General Assembly have, in one form or another, been on its agenda since my country joined the United Nations nine years ago. Resolutions dealing with these items have been debated and adopted, but little progress has been made in giving effect to some of them. Circumstances which first led to the inclusion of these items on the agenda still prevail, or have even worsened.
317.	In the interim, issues which once seemed somewhat abstract, and problems which once seemed rather remote, have gained concreteness and immediacy for my country. Without wishing to detract in any way from the intrinsic importance of other items on the agenda, I propose to focus on those issues and problems.
318.	But let me begin by stating that, despite the slow and sometimes frustrating progress being made in dealing practically with certain items, the Government and people of Papua New Guinea remain as strongly committed to the United Nations, as the Prime Minister of my country, Mr. Michael T. Somare, reaffirmed when he addressed the thirty- eighth session of the General Assembly. In fact, recent developments have, if anything, increased the importance which we attach to the United Nations, and strengthened our commitment to it. As the White Paper which guides the Government's conduct of Papua New Guinea's foreign relations makes clear, diplomacy plays a 'vital role ... in serving our national interests'. We have a vital interest in participating as effectively and constructively as we can in the General Assembly's deliberations and 'in supporting a strengthened United Nations system'.
319.	We meet at a time of greatly increased—and increasing—rivalry between the super-Powers. Communication between their leaders has probably reached an all-time low. Even talks about arms control and disarmament have broken down. The resulting tensions can be felt in all parts of the world.
320.	Third-world countries have been affected by rivalry between the two super-Powers in various— but almost always destructive—ways. Some have fallen direct victims to the insecurity felt by the leaders of the super-Powers as a result of the rivalry between them. Afghanistan is an example. Others have become the location of contests between foreign and/or domestic forces, as in Central America and the Middle East. Yet others have suffered at the hands of forces allied with, or acting for, one of the super-Powers. Kampuchea is an instance.
321.	As the Government of a newly independent and developing country, we attach particular and great importance to the rights of such countries to be secure, free from attack or other forms of unwelcome interference by their neighbours. That is why we have been, and remain, so strongly opposed to the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Kampuchea. That is why we have condemned the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. That is why we have called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from other countries, including Lebanon, and welcome the recent agreement between the French and Libyan Governments to withdraw their forces from Chad.
322.	Every day more than $2 billion is spent on arms by the super-Powers. The figure is many times the total world expenditure on foreign aid.
323.	Regrettably, much of the money being spent on arms comes from the budgets of Governments in the third world. Meanwhile, the population of third- world countries is increasing and the prospects open to citizens of third-world countries for equitable participation in development processes and in their fruits recede. The gap between developed and developing countries widens. And international tensions continue, in consequence, to rise.
324.	The arms race between the super-Powers is not, however, the only arms race in the world. Nor is rivalry between the super-Powers the only source of armed conflict. The terrible and costly war between Iran and Iraq is only a particularly deplorable example of armed conflict between the forces of neighbouring third-world countries. It is, moreover, a conflict which carries with it the calamitous possibility of drawing in other, outside Powers, unless it can be promptly contained.
323. Regional bodies can make an effective contribution to limiting the effects of rivalry between the super-Powers, in restraining other international conflicts, and in arms control. The achievements of ASEAN, as well as proposals adopted by the South Pacific Forum, spring to mind.
326.	Direct dealings between the Governments of neighbouring countries can make a similar contribution. So can direct dealings of a non-official kind. And here the recent rapprochement between the Japanese and South Korean Governments, as well as the offer of emergency relief for South Korea by the North Korean Red Cross, come to mind, perhaps as models for further developments directed towards reducing divisions and tensions in the North Pacific region.
327.	My Government is concerned about the long-standing animosity between the two nations in the Korean peninsula. They were one people; they can once again be one people. No one from outside can find a solution to their problems. Reunification as their goal is for them, and them alone.
328.	If the United Nations, a body founded in the aftermath of war and dedicated to preventing further war, fails to play its appointed part, where can the peoples of the world turn? Members of the United Nations have the required machinery at their disposal to work for the reduction of international tensions, control over the manufacture and distribution of arms and, ultimately, complete disarmament. The responsibility to act is squarely ours. Dare we, especially the representatives of newly independent and developing countries, where other needs are so urgently pressing, fail our children and other members of our families, our fellow citizens and other human beings by not using that machinery with sufficient will and might?
329.	Certain of the issues and problems raised by the situation which has been developing on my country's border with Indonesia since February of this year once seemed abstract and remote from Papua New Guinea. But some at least are, without doubt, generally familiar to people from other countries. They are among the issues and problems which I have suggested have gained concreteness and immediacy for my country.
330.	As with many other newly independent countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the national boundaries of Papua New Guinea were drawn up, without regard for local geography or custom, by our former colonial rulers. But, as with most other newly independent countries, we have accepted them. Apart from some minor—and welcome—adjustments on the border with Australia, so have our neighbours.
331.	The Governments of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia recognize one another's sovereignty, integrity and independence. Under a Treaty concluded in 1979, we agreed not to allow our respective border areas to be used 'as sanctuary, staging areas, bases or for illegal activities against each other'. Despite the difficult terrain and strong ties between traditional border-dwellers on both sides, the Government of Papua New Guinea has honestly tried to abide by that Treaty.
332.	We have always respected the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. Regrettably, however, it has appeared clearly that the reverse has not always been the case. On several occasions in recent years, we have protested to the Indonesian Government at what we believed to be violations of our territorial sovereignty. Those violations have included the intrusion into our territory of military aircraft, the destruction of a village near the border and the construction at four points of a major highway into Papua New Guinea.
333.	In each case, the Papua New Guinea Government has sought an explanation of the violation before protesting. In line with our policy of independent and constructive neighbourly co-operation with the Governments of nearby countries, we have then sought to look beyond our protest for ways of avoiding a repetition and of maintaining and strengthening good relations with the Government and people of Indonesia.
334.	Let me emphasize that there is no disagreement between the Governments of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia as to where the international boundary is or should be. We have a joint border agreement which governs the administration of our common border. It is reviewed every five years; it is being reviewed now. We co-operate in many other ways.
335.	None the less, my Government has not been satisfied with official responses to most of our protests. In only one case, and only after joint verification by the surveyors from both countries of the road intrusions into Papua New Guinea territory, did they admit that the mistake was unintentional and apologized publicly for it. Our two Governments agreed to close off the sections of the road permanently and did so last August. Four permanent concrete markers were installed at the points of closure and, because of the difficult terrain, we have both agreed to put in additional monuments to identify the border more clearly.
336.	The situation on the border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia has been disturbed for reasons other than the border violations I have mentioned. I refer in particular to the unprecedented influx of more than 10,000 Indonesian citizens who have crossed into Papua New Guinea since February and remain in my country contrary to law or established procedures.
337.	Living conditions in the border area do not provide for much more than basic subsistence at the best of times. Despite a special border development programme, Government resources in the area are not great. The strain caused by the presence of some 10,000 people in camps on the Papua New Guinea side of the border has, therefore, been considerable. Suffering, including a number of tragic deaths, has resulted.
338.	The Government of Papua New Guinea is doing what it can to cope with the unprecedented situation. We deeply appreciate the assistance which the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Indonesian Government and voluntary agencies have given in caring for the people in these camps. But we would urge them not to lose sight either of conditions in the area around the camps or of the circumstances which have caused the people in the camps to leave their homes. Those circumstances are not of the Papua New Guinea Government's making.
339.	Although we are under no legal obligation to do so, my Government will treat people who meet the normal international requirements as refugees. We hope that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as members of the General Assembly, will be able to help us find them permanent homes. But let me make it clear that the responsibility for deciding who can remain in Papua New Guinea belongs to the appropriate authorities in my country. Border-crossers who do not qualify for refugee status in the normal way will be expected to return to their homes in Indonesia. The people and Government of my country cannot afford to keep them. They have no real right to stay. But let me add that we are sensitive to the need for them to be given certain assurances about their safety, well-being and reintegration before they go back.
340.	The Governments of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia agreed to use diplomatic means to negotiate effective bilateral arrangements for the return and reintegration of the border-crossers into Indonesia. Those negotiations, though difficult, have been useful and productive. Both Governments appreciate the need for the safety of the returning border- crossers to be publicly assured.
341.	The Papua New Guinea Government has been unable to persuade its Indonesian counterpart to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to monitor the re-entry and subsequent situation of the border-crossers, but we appreciate the Indonesian Government's agreement to allow Papua New Guinea officials to be present at the points of entry and to visit them in their local environment. I hope that arrangements for the return, including the assurances that we have sought on behalf of the border-crossers, can be finalized soon.
342.	Nuclear issues are neither abstract for nor remote from Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries. They have concreteness and an immediacy which both Governments and people hi the region regard as being generally most unfortunate. As with other issues I have discussed, regional organizations have been active on nuclear issues.
343.	Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have been persistent, vocal and consistent opponents of the testing, proliferation and use of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, party to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water. We have acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and are following preparations for the Third Review Conference of the Parties to that Treaty with close interest. We not only subscribe to the London Convention on the dumping of wastes at sea's but support its extension to prohibit the dumping of all nuclear wastes.
344.	In line with the policy and treaty commitments I have outlined, successive Papua New Guinea Governments have regularly strongly protested against Japanese proposals that nuclear wastes might be dumped in Pacific Ocean. We have done the same in respect of the flagrant disregard for local opinion and welfare displayed by the French Government in continuing its nuclear-weapons-testing programme in French Polynesia.
345.	We cannot help noting the close and deplorable connection that seems to exist between the colonial and nuclear policies of certain narrowly self- interested Powers in the region. We feel deeply about the threat those policies pose not only to the health and environment of the region but also to the political rights of Pacific islanders. 
346.	The Governments of many countries which we regard of primary concern to Papua New Guinea share our views on nuclear issues. Thus, the 18 representatives of Asian and Pacific countries who attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government regional meeting in my country's capital, Port Moresby, in August this year condemned the French Government's nuclear-weapons-testing programme as well as proposals to dump nuclear wastes in the Pacific.
347.	The 13-member South Pacific Forum has agreed on the 'desirability of establishing a nuclear- free zone in the region at the earliest possible opportunity'. Similarly, the Foreign Ministers of six member Governments of ASEAN recently agreed to undertake a study towards the realization of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in their region.
348.	The proposals which are before the South Pacific Forum extend to the prospective banning of the testing, acquisition or reception, stationing, development, manufacture or use of nuclear weapons in the region. A working group, in which the Papua New Guinea Government hopes to play an active part, has been set up to consider relevant legal and other issues. A draft treaty should be prepared for consideration by the Forum in 1985.
349.	The proposal of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers is but a recent example of the practical ways in which ASEAN serves wider interests. Like other proposals for concrete and immediate action on an urgent issue, it is most welcome.
350.	Colonialism has a concrete and immediate meaning for most Papua New Guineans—indeed, for most Pacific islanders. It is a meaning born of direct, recent and personal experience. While we were, mercifully, spared the worst excesses of colonialism experienced in Africa and Asia, we still attach great value to the right of self-determination and to its customary outcome, independence. We pay close attention to the conditions and rights of peoples in the remaining dependent territories.
351.	Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have taken a particular interest in developments in the French territories—New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna—and in the last of the United Nations trust territories—the United States Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. So have the Governments of other independent South Pacific countries. New Caledonia has been of special concern to us and to the Governments of the South Pacific Forum.
352.	My Government has noted the constitutional and electoral reforms approved by the French Parliament in May, especially those which hold out the possibility of eventual independence, but, like other members of the South Pacific Forum, we cannot see why a referendum on the issues should not be held before 1989. Therefore, we urge that the date should be brought forward. Additional poetical and administrative powers should be transferred from Paris to Noumea as a preparatory step. The rights of the indigenous inhabitants, the Kanaks, and the other ethnic groups which make up the genuine local population of New Caledonia should be safeguarded by the exclusion of transitory or short-term residents from participation in the vote.
353.	As recommended by the South Pacific Forum last August at Tuvalu, the French Government should make a public statement that describes independence as 'the desirable, logical and acknowledged outcome' of the scheduled referendum. It should act to ensure that the Kanak people can play a full and active part in educational, vocational and administrative institutions in New Caledonia. The Forum also agreed that a delegation of ministers from Forum countries should hold discussions with the French Government as well as leaders of the independence movement.
354.	All significant political actors in New Caledonia, outside the Government, have expressed strong reservations about the reforms approved in May, but their reasons, motives and constitutional objectives have varied widely. We note especially that the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front has announced that it proposes to hold its own elections before proclaiming a 'provisional independent' Government.
355.	The Papua New Guinea Government, therefore, repeats its call to the French Government to bring forward the date for self-determination, to make more urgent preparations for it and to safeguard the interests of the Kanaks as well as those ethnic groups that have a legitimate stake in the future of New Caledonia We do so not only because of our cultural bonds and political sympathies with the Kanaks but because of the threat to stability in the South Pacific posed by continuing delay.
356.	The Papua New Guinea Government has been pleased to participate in visiting missions sent by the Trusteeship Council to observe the plebiscites on termination of the Trusteeship Agreement for the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. We are pleased to note that the Constitution of Palau and the rights of the Papuans are fully respected by the Administering Authority.
357.	As I have already indicated, we are conscious of the connections which sometimes pertain between the colonial and nuclear policies of certain Powers. Papua New Guinea, however, will not condone attempts to override or bypass the provision in the Palauan Constitution that outlaws the entry of nuclear weapons into Palau.
358.	We will also not condone attempts to deny, delay or qualify the abstract right to self-determination by the people of dependent territories, however remote they might be from areas which we normally describe as being of primary concern to Papua New Guinea.
359.	My Government urges Palau and the United States Government to take the necessary and appropriate measures to enable both the Trusteeship Council and the Security Council to consider and finally determine the status of free association which the Micronesian people wish to have as the basis for their self-determination and independence.
360.	Apartheid practised by the racist Republic of South Africa, is the most systematic form of institutionalized racial discrimination and segregation. The international community has repeatedly condemned as a 'crime against humanity' and called on the South African Government to revise its racist policies in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Assembly has expressed deep concern over the grave situation in South Africa as constituting a threat to international peace and security. In resolution 36/172B, the Assembly endorsed, as a 'framework for effective international action for the elimination of apartheid, the Paris Declaration on Sanctions against South Africa, adopted by the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, held in Paris in May 1981.
361.	Papua New Guinea finds it difficult to understand why some Members of this body continue to condone the actions of a regime which has persistently spurned United Nations resolutions by supporting South Africa indirectly through various actions. Their action in this respect is indicative of the indifference of those Members of this world body which at the same time profess to be the guardians of human rights and the dignity of mankind.
362.	Time and time again, the General Assembly has adopted resolutions seeking to redress the abhorrent situation that exists in Namibia, but to no avail. Despite the intensive efforts of the Secretary-General and the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978), the Pretoria regime continues to flout the relevant United Nations resolutions with cynical impunity. Papua New Guinea will continue to support United Nations efforts in pressing for an early and peaceful settlement of this long-standing question. The framework espoused in resolution 435 (1978) remains the only acceptable solution to the Namibian question. We strongly urge all concerned to facilitate speedily the implementation of United Nations initiatives and plans so that Namibia's independence will not be further delayed. In this respect, we deplore the injection of extraneous elements into the question of Namibia's independence. Therefore, Papua New Guinea rejects the so- called 'linkage' rationale.
363.	On the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), we urge all parties to the dispute over the future of the islands to accord the same right of self- determination to the people who call those islands 'home' and to work together for a peaceful solution.
364.	Interdependence seems increasingly to be a feature of international economic relations as perceived by leaders and observers from developed countries, but the perception from developing countries is often rather different.
365.	Like the Governments of the developed countries represented at the London Economic Summit held from 7 to 9 June 1984, the Papua New Guinea Government welcomes signs of recovery from the recession which has burdened all economies during the early 1980s; but we cannot help noting that the benefits of recovery are becoming immediate and concrete in developed countries while remaining rather more remote and abstract in developing countries.
366.	Fundamental adjustments must be made to the structure of international economic relations if the commitment to international equity and order, of which my Prime Minister spoke in this Assembly in 1983, is to be put into practice. We must not allow our current relief at the effects of recovery to divert attention from our previous concern with the causes of recession. We must also not forget why proposals for a new international economic order, North-South dialogue and South-South co-operation were first included in the Assembly's agenda and why they still appear there, even if they seem to generate less excitement—and perhaps less hope—than they once did.
367.	As with other developing countries, the economy of Papua New Guinea relies on unprocessed agricultural and mineral products for most of its export income. Manufactured goods are imported. Foreign aid from the Governments of developed countries, especially Australia, assists in our development.
368.	The Papua New Guinea Government welcomes the statement made by the representatives of developed countries who attended the ministerial council meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] in Paris in May that their Governments intend to 'strengthen and improve trade, financial and investment relations with developing countries'. We appreciate their recognition that doing so is 'a matter of mutual interest'. However, more than words prompt and practical actions are needed. Deeds speak louder than words.
369.	The Papua New Guinea Government is a party to trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand and, through the Lome Convention, the European Economic Community. They provide non- reciprocal, preferential and mainly duty-free access to their respective markets for unprocessed exports from my country. However, much as we appreciate the benefits we receive under these agreements, we need to increase in-country processing in order to find employment for our youth. And we need markets for those products—markets which in developed countries are often heavily protected by tariffs and other means.
370.	The Papua New Guinea Government welcomes the commitment made by participants in the London Economic Summit to urge resistance to and reduction of protectionism. But, as I have already suggested, what we seek is prompt and practical action. Participants in the London Economic Summit also agreed 'to maintain and wherever possible increase flows of resources' to developing countries. But progress being made towards attaining the current, modest target for aid of 0.7 per cent of the gross national products of donor countries set by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD has been slow. We trust that the emphasis being placed by OECD members on 'increasing aid effectiveness through strengthened aid co-ordination' will not be to the disadvantage of the people and Governments of developing countries.
371.	The Government of Papua New Guinea has acceded to the Agreement Establishing the Common Fund for Commodities, set up under the auspices of UNCTAD. Let me; therefore, restate our regret at the continuing delay in bringing the Fund into operation. Let me say, too, that we find little solace in the rather lukewarm reference to the Fund made in the Declaration issued at the London Economic Summit.
372.	My Government repeats its previous calls to the Government of the United States to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, especially in view of difficulties that have arisen over the activities of United States tuna boats in the South Pacific. Let me add that we look forward to a successful outcome to negotiations between members of the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency and the United States Government, and we hope for finalization of a mutually acceptable fisheries agreement. 
373.	The Papua New Guinea Government is, of course, a member of the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. We are also a close and interested observer of another successful example of South-South co-operation, ASEAN.
374.	We benefit from the technical co-operation agreements we have with two ASEAN members, Indonesia and Malaysia, and two other countries— China and South Korea. Although we do not, as yet, have technical co-operation agreements with the four other ASEAN members—-the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei Darussalam—we do, however, appreciate their assistance provided in various forms on a bilateral basis and through another regional body, the Colombo Plan.
375.	In fulfilment of our commitment to collective self-help and self-reliance through South-South co-operation, we hope to be able to give practical assistance to our partners in return.
376.	At the beginning of this address, I said that I would focus on issues and problems which had once seemed abstract and remote from Papua New Guinea but which have become immediate and concrete. My decision to do so was not meant to imply that other items on the agenda for this session of the General Assembly are necessarily less important. There will, in fact, be further opportunities for the Papua New Guinea delegation to make our positions known on other issues.
377.	The approach I have adopted here was intended to give expression to the Papua New Guinea Government's basic approach towards the conduct of its country's foreign relations of active and selective engagement with issues and factors relevant to our national interests. My Government's foreign policy is geared to preserving and increasing international co-operation and maintaining and extending the rule of law. We have a particular interest in supporting a strengthened United Nations system. Towards that end, my statement has been intended to show the sense of purpose and direction with which my delegation intends to deal with issues before the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly.
"
2508,39,1984,AUS,"﻿May I congratulate you, Sir, warmly and sincerely, on behalf of the Australian Government, on your election as President of the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Although at opposite ends of the alphabet, Australia and Zambia enjoy closer relations than many would expect. We do this through the Commonwealth and bilaterally. I know, too, that Australia can regard you, personally, as a friend. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, the Government of Australia is well aware of your valuable contribution as President of that body.
103.	I should also like to extend a warm and neighbourly welcome to Brunei Darussalam as the newest Member of this world body. The admission of the 159th Member brings us closer to the goal of universality in membership of the United Nations.
104.	As all representatives will know, Australia is one of the two agreed candidates of its regional group standing for election to the Security Council for 1985 and 1986. We see membership of the Council as an opportunity for Australia to pursue its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. I should like to take this opportunity of assuring other delegations that Australia, if elected, will approach its duties with a sense of responsibility and self-confidence. We shall also strive to uphold the Charter and to make the Council a more effective instrument for the containment of existing conflicts and the prevention of new conflicts.
105.	It has to be said that in the last 12 months the long march to world harmony and the achievement of universal basic human freedom has been painfully slow. Australia agrees with the observation in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization that a major reason for this is the regrettable tendency to retreat from internationalism and multilateralism. I propose to explain Australia's position on those issues in which, for strong historical and geographical reasons, we have a special interest.
106.	The United Nations continues to spend much energy on the state of affairs in southern Africa and particularly the poisonous effects there of the apartheid policies of the South African Government. The facade there of constitutional reform has in fact made matters worse. Indeed, the non-white citizens have demonstrated this in the most dramatic way possible. Black South Africans—70 per cent of the population—have been allowed no part in this alleged reform. Only one Coloured or Indian person in five was persuaded to vote for the new constitution.
107.	The constitution that emerged in this so-called reform depends totally on the system and the laws of apartheid. Apartheid is designed, as we know, to entrench the domination in South Africa of a racial minority. This evil doctrine depends on injustice and fosters violence. The world community has condemned it and Australia is unequivocally opposed to it. So long as it continues and so long as the South African Government pursues it, South Africa cannot expect to be welcomed back into the international community.
108.	In Namibia, we are still waiting for the promised outcome of the latest round of negotiations, which started early this year. All principal parties have professed to agree to the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Australia therefore regrets that the principle of linkage between independence negotiations and the presence of Cuban personnel in Angola has been raised as a barrier to progress. Moreover, there is no guarantee that more issues outside the scope of resolution 435 (1978) will not be raised in the future to impede solution of an issue which could and should have been solved by now. Australia shares the impatience of African and other nations over the delay of Namibia's independence and we question the professed good intentions of the South African Government in this regard.
109.	In the South-East Asian area, stability is subjected to undesirable strain by Viet Nam's continued occupation of Cambodia. Australia condemned the invasion of Cambodia when it happened and we continue to condemn it. Nobody can tolerate armed incursion by one country into another, wherever it occurs. Accordingly, Australia considers that Viet Nam should withdraw from Cambodia. The reasonable way for this to take place would be in the context of a settlement acceptable to all parties. This is why the need continues for negotiations towards a settlement, for which Australia has been working in the past 18 months. Australia remains ready to provide the site and any facilities necessary so that the parties involved, or any combination of them, can discuss ways in which settlement can be reached in Cambodia.
110.	The Soviet Union continues its occupation of Afghanistan and, through recent offensives, including high-level bombing of the Panjshir Valley, has added immeasurably to the suffering of the Afghan people. The recent widening of the conflict through the bombing of civilian targets in Pakistan by Afghan aircraft has served to heighten the degree of risk associated with the continued Soviet occupation. The needless loss of civilian and military life in the region will come to an end only when the Soviet Union withdraws from Afghanistan in accordance with successive United Nations resolutions.
111.	In the South Pacific region, Australia remains alert to the fact that a colonial situation remains in New Caledonia. We continue to support peaceful evolution to independence in New Caledonia, determined in accordance with the wishes of the people there and free from outside influence. We welcome the recognition by the French Government of the legitimate claim of the Kanak people to an inherent and active right to self-determination in which independence is an option. We no e that an act of self-determination is scheduled to be held by 1989. Australia calls on France to ensure that the transition to an independent, multiracial New Caledonia is achieved speedily and peacefully and, indeed, in a shorter time-scale than previously envisaged.
112.	A just and lasting peace in the Middle East remains a necessary but elusive goal. It can be achieved only if it is accepted that Israel must be allowed to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and that the Palestinian issue is centrally important for any settlement. Acceptance of these principles does not mean that Israel can feel free to continue its settlement programme in the West Bank, since these settlements are contrary to international law and an obstacle to peace. The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], which represents a significant proportion of the Palestinian people, should be included in the search for peace. Australia acknowledges also that the Palestinian people have a right to self-determination, including a right to choose independence and the possibility of their own independent state. However, there is limited, perhaps non-existent, opportunity for the PLO to engage productively in the search for peace so long as it persists in denying Israel's right to exist. The Australian Government will maintain its refusal to recognize the PLO while it persists in that denial.
113.	A major cause of fear around the world community, of course, lies in the unsteady state of relations between the super-Powers and the obstruction this is creating to effective arms control leading to disarmament. This year has seen more growth in nuclear arsenals and deployment of new missiles in both East and West. The prospect for talks between the super-Powers in September on arms control for outer space was withdrawn, for what to the rest of the world must seem specious reasons. Their negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces and on strategic nuclear weapons have been suspended. In the negotiations at Stockholm and Vienna about European issues, there has been no progress despite the new proposals. In the Conference on Disarmament, meeting at Geneva, a shameful procedural deadlock is holding up the agenda of negotiations.
114.	Australia has a special right to express its concern about this, as the site of the joint facilities with the United States, and as a major supplier of uranium. The Australian Government believes that the joint facilities are an essential part of the monitoring system in effective arms control. It believes that holding on to our uranium would be an obstacle to disarmament because it would mean abandoning the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Government has gone to great lengths to convince Australians to accept the paradox that the existence of the facilities and the supply of uranium make nuclear war less, not more likely. We believe that our role in these matters gives us the right to be heard on the need for genuine progress towards nuclear disarmament.
115.	This crucial issue has the very highest priority among our policies. We have fully supported moves to draw up a draft convention on chemical weapons. We believe that there is a general will within the Geneva Conference to establish a convention that prohibits chemical weapons and their means of production. The Australian Government welcomed the submission by the United States of a draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons, which contains what we consider to be elements of an effective system. This draft text has been criticized in some quarters. Let us not leave it there; let the critics come forward with constructive alternatives.
116.	We—Australia—have put it to the Conference on Disarmament that in its exploration of the issue of arms control in outer space it should consider measures to protect from attack all satellites which help to preserve the strategic balance and which can contribute to monitoring disarmament agreements. We have proposed also that the same protection be given to the ground stations which are essential to the operation of those satellites.
117.	The Australian Government has given an extraordinary amount of attention to the issue of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, an issue which is central to effective arms control and disarmament. Our objective is to get meaningful negotiations on the way to establishing such a treaty. We have been trying to help overcome the procedural obstacles which have been put in the way of the treaty. We have been trying to get a subsidiary body of the Geneva Conference set up to do the urgently needed practical work with a view to negotiating such a treaty. Naturally, we would prefer a so-called full negotiating mandate. We would prefer agreement in clear terms that parties will start negotiating with a view towards drafting a truly comprehensive test-ban treaty. But the consensus for such a mandate apparently is not there. The mandate that we have proposed instead is the best possible in the present circumstances. It proposes that the Ad Hoc Committee of the Conference on Disarmament should work on scope, verification and compliance with a view to the negotiation of such a treaty. I submitted a working paper at Geneva in August as a guide for negotiations on these very points.
118.	The Australian Government will give all possible support to work on the treaty. But I will repeat now what I said in August at Geneva: we cannot accept a state of affairs in which an already limited mandate is used to justify delay in progress towards a treaty which has been in the gestation phase for far too long as it is. It would be wrong for anybody to presume that Australians in general have an inexhaustible well of patience with the slow pace of the work being done in the cause of solving a problem that could destroy us all.
119.	In his report on the work of the Organization, the Secretary-General urges that the multilateral forums be used to deal with this compelling issue. All Member States should use those forums to let the nuclear-weapon States know that real progress is needed towards limiting those weapons that cause such fear around the world. Let us smaller States remember the opportunity that the United Nations provides—in the General Assembly, in the various disarmament forums and in the IAEA. In common, we have an influence on even the most powerful of our colleagues that we lack when we act alone.
120.	In the context of disarmament, I refer briefly to two important developments: first, the increased international interest in Antarctica promoted by our good friend Malaysia. The Antarctic Treaty has provided an effective basis for peaceful co-operation, for scientific co-operation and environmental conservation for a quarter of a century. The disarmament provisions of the Treaty have established the only denuclearized and demilitarized zone in the world today. While we believe the Treaty system is flexible and that the operation of the Treaty can be improved, Australia will oppose any proposals in this body which we consider would lead to undermining the Treaty. The best course on Antarctica is to await the expected report of the Secretary-General. Only when we have examined it will we be in a position to consider what, if any, further steps involving the United Nations might be considered.
121.	The second development of importance was the recent decision by the countries of the South Pacific to begin work on a treaty to create a nuclear- free-zone in the South Pacific region. The proposal, brought by Australia to the countries of the South Pacific Forum, has significance not only for the region but also for the whole of the international community which wishes to make the world a nuclear-safe place. This time next year, I feel sure, the countries of the region will be able to report that a significant step in reaching this objective has been taken.
122.	Another great issue the resolution of which demands our combined will concerns the instability caused by the indebtedness of developing countries. This issue is pressing not only because of its impact on the world financial system but also because of the hardship involved for developing countries that are undertaking adjustment programmes. The Australian Government firmly supports the international consensus for the central role of the IMF in this issue and the case-by-case approach it has adopted to deal with current problems. This approach has its critics, but there is in the short term no effective alternative. It is important that the IMF continue to insist on a disciplined attack on a most complex problem and that it be given consistent support while it is doing so. But we must be careful to keep our eyes on the political dangers ahead as we deal with the debt problem.
123.	One of those dangers concerns the burden of interest rates—a matter that the leading economies represented at the London Economic Summit, held in June this year, failed to address adequately. It would be unfortunate if rescheduling attempts now being arranged were to be overrun by any sudden climb in interest rates. I say that although there appears to be a fairly solid level of confidence that these arrangements have been crafted together in a more secure way.
124.	A note of caution also needs to be sounded about the possible political effects of some of the conditions imposed by IMF debt rearrangements. There are States going through the adjustment process—with all that that implies about strict economic management— which are also undergoing complex and sensitive political change; some are emerging into democracy from long periods of authoritarian rule. We must be careful that policies for economic recovery and stability do not undermine their fledgling social and political reforms.
125.	Another danger lies in the tendency to over-simplify the debt problem. The debts that command our attention are those of the relatively well-off countries which tapped the commercial markets in the 1970s to help achieve their considerable industrial growth potential.
126.	There is, however, a real danger that the problems of other debtor countries, less significant in terms of their implications for their creditors but no less serious in relation to their own domestic impact, will be crowded out of our attention. Such countries, generally poorer and with less ability to attract the new opportunities of commercial borrowing in the 1970s, are linked more to traditional sources such as official development assistance and development institution loans. The solutions may be different, but the task is no less urgent. When coupled, as in Africa, with additional problems such as drought and rapidly spreading desertification, the need for attention is all the more compelling. This issue was recently reported on by a Commonwealth Group of Experts on the Debt Crisis. That Group, established by the Commonwealth Heads of Government at their 1983 summit, included among its proposed measures to help low-income debtor countries a call for additional resources for IDA. Australia has decided to respond by making a voluntary and unilateral special contribution to IDA, in addition to our pledged contribution of $200 million.
127.	I have said that this complex problem demands our combined will for its resolution. It is in the United Nations—which has striven for 40 years to serve the interests of all members of the world community—that this combined will can best be utilized.
128.	Australia emphasizes the point, because we disagree with the disposition in some quarters to accept that the United Nations is perhaps afflicted by a kind of premature hardening of the arteries. Part of the blame for this feeling must be attributed to the Organization itself. From earliest days, Secretaries- General have complained of lack of co-ordination and of inefficiency. Many persons inside and outside the United Nations have become disenchanted with its reputation as a talking-shop. But we should be careful not to encourage too extreme a reaction to this. The complaints made about the Organization may to some extent be true, but they are far from the whole truth.
129.	For all its imperfections, the United Nations has developed a range of policies and activities that have brought comfort and even life to people all over the world. As the Secretary-General says, it has played a decisive role in the process of decolonization. I should like to mention parenthetically in this context that Australia conducted an act of self-determination in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which was observed by a United Nations Visiting Mission. We expect that this development will lead at this session to the de-listing of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands as a Non-Self-Governing Territory, thereby ending Australia's role as an administering Power.
130.	In the field of human rights, the United Nations has facilitated the development of a framework of international standards and obligations which translates into practical terms the humanitarian ideals of the Charter. This is a continuing process. Australia very much hopes to see the Assembly take the necessary steps to adopt an effective convention against the abhorrent practice of torture.
131.	United Nations agencies have helped eradicate disease, provide care for refugees, control drug abuse and expand food production. I specify the literacy and education programmes of UNESCO, since that agency has been subject to intensive examination recently.
132.	I am not convinced either that all the 4,000 or so resolutions adopted by the General Assembly are entirely the 'hollow voting victories' that Dag Hammarskjold suggested they were. The whole ritual of conference and dialogue has played an underestimated role in dampening down tension and satisfying passions.
133.	Another source of criticism of the United Nations is the natural disappointment that has followed the enthusiastic but unreal expectations of early years. People expected the United Nations to create a Utopia—something requiring powers that no nation was prepared to cede to it.
134.	Yet another part of the United Nations problem is that it is no longer the tight little community of the Second World War victors that was set up nearly 40 years ago. The balance of representation in the United Nations is now starting to reflect the balance between the main regions of the world in terms of population. If the United Nations were today what it was 40 years ago, then it would truly be irrelevant; instead, it represents the real world, not the world some would like it to be.
135.	I am saying this because the Organization, which has brought untold benefit to so many people, should be defended against attack. I am saying it because my country, Australia, feels that it has a special obligation to take part in this defence. Australia was not only a founding Member of the United Nations, but also an active supporter of the view in its early days that the United Nations should not be the preserve of great Powers. We foresaw the opportunities for Members of a truly representative United Nations to advance interests in common that we could not promote individually. We wanted the newest and humblest of nations to be able to mix with the oldest and mightiest in conferences and dialogue. We believed that smaller States like ourselves would be swamped if great Powers in a nuclear age were free to arrange matters among themselves in private as they did at Potsdam and Yalta. We are all affected by the arrangements between great Powers. We have the right to be able to express views about them and to be involved in the formation of these views.
136.	I have said that disarmament and international economic stability are the major pressing issues of our time. The Australian Government urges that more energetic ways to settle these issues, in particular disarmament, should be pursued within the multilateral framework. Not only is the search for answers urgent; it is also of paramount importance that the answers be fully representative of us all, large and small nations alike.
"
2513,39,1984,VUT,"﻿On behalf of the Government and the people of Vanuatu, I congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-ninth session. Your election is a tribute to you and to your outstanding work as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia. It is also a most fitting tribute to the country you represent. Zambia and the other front-line States continue to set examples of patience, perseverance and strict adherence to high principles in the face of extreme and severe provocations. For this, the international community is grateful.
36.	I also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Jorge Illueca, of Panama, for the excellent manner in which he discharged his very difficult duties.
37.	I extend warm congratulations to Brunei Darussalam, the newest Member of the United Nations. We are particularly proud to greet a neighbouring State as the Organization's 159th Member. We wish its people and its Government well and assure them of our continuing friendship, respect and cooperation.
38.	As this is the first time I have had the privilege of representing my country here at the United Nations, I wish to add my voice to those who have already spoken in praise of the Secretary-General. In the days to come, all of us will need to draw even further on his experience and considerable diplomatic skills. I only hope that we will all heed the words of his report on the work of the Organization, which is very thorough, and exhibit the same devotion to duty and candour for which he is so well-known.
39.	As we stand poised to enter the fifth decade since the end of the Second World War and the establishment of the Organization, we, the nations of the world, face new and unique challenges. In a sense, the problems we discuss here today are fundamentally the same problems which confronted earlier generations.
40.	How will our children be educated, and with what values? How will all of the people of this globe be fed, clothed and housed, and at what cost? How will our elderly be cared for, and their knowledge and experience preserved for succeeding generations? How will the resources of our planet be gathered and distributed? How shall we view our neighbours and how shall we relate to them—those who are near as well as those who are far? How will we ensure that all men and women shall in their lifetimes enjoy justice, equality of opportunity, and the right to think and worship as they wish? How shall we assure all children from every corner of this earth that they have the right to dream the dreams of childhood— the dreams of happiness and of life? Finally, how shall we ensure the survival of this and succeeding generations?
41.	These are rather simple, straightforward, time-less and universal questions. Far less simple, straightforward, timeless or universal are the answers or the various equations different nations utilize to arrive at their own answers.
42.	The dramatic growth of the world's population, the increasing scarcity of some resources and the imperfect allocation of others, the short-sighted view of history that some people have, and the advent of modern technology have now complicated our search for solutions to mankind's ageless problems.
43.	Some feel that they know all the answers and, in their arrogance, arrogate to themselves the role of purveyors of absolute truths. 'Do as we say', they admonish us—but they certainly do not wish us to do as they do. Others believe that most of us do not even know what the questions are, let alone have the faintest idea of how to answer them. One arrogance is as bad as the other. Perhaps, of mankind's many shortcomings, arrogance and lack of humility are at once the worst and most obvious.
44.	If arrogance is not such a prevalent flaw in international relations today, then why is it that the threat or use of force is still the corner-stone of the foreign policies of so many States? Large and medium-sized Powers, developed and developing countries, aligned and non-aligned States, east and west, north and south—with far too much frequency—see their respective military establishments as the ultimate instruments of their foreign and domestic policies.
45.	The arts of peaceful advocacy and persuasion are too often forgotten or ignored. This is r I a new problem, but, given our current level of knowledge and the current as well as the future technology of destruction, are these the values we wish to bestow upon our children? Have we not yet arrived at a higher level of civilization?
46.	If arrogance is not such a prevalent flaw in international relations today, then why is it that the sincere and legitimate strivings of so many people are consistently cast in, and confused by, east-west contradictions and the power politics of the world's two super-Powers? Some who should know better even continue to insist that smaller nations must choose in which 'bed to lie', as if there were no other choice but to belong in spirit, if not in fact, to one of the world's two great military and economic camps.
47.	We, in Vanuatu, know better. Our political independence, our membership in the United Nations, and our membership in the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries—all manifest our desire to belong to no one but ourselves. Having had the unique experience of having two colonial rulers with equal powers at the same time, our people are well versed in the perils of being anyone's proxy.
48.	Our unusual colonial history as a condominium left us with a great appreciation for genuine non- alignment and considerable experience in its practice. Asking us to choose between our two colonial rulers would have been a useless exercise. How can one choose between waves in the ocean?
49.	We did, however, develop at the same time an understanding of how vital it is to communicate, particularly when we speak different languages. How else are misunderstandings to be avoided and misconceptions corrected?
50.	Today, more than ever before, the ability to communicate is vital to our survival as a species. It is unfortunate that we do not devote more of our energy to the communication of ideas—real ideas, and not just empty rhetoric.
51.	Why cannot the world's two foremost military Powers set an example and speak to each other all the time and not just for the benefit of the television cameras? Why cannot these two Powers listen to each other as well? Why cannot they listen to the rest of us even some of the time? Are they so frightened by what we say? Are our ideas so dangerous that their military might, their wealth and their power cannot protect them? Is what we, the nations of the world, have to say so unworthy that it does not even deserve a hearing?
52.	If both behave in the same manner towards the rest of us, then does it really matter which of them rules the world? Is ruling the world what each super-Power really wants? We think not. Each says publicly that this is what the other wants. But is that the truth? Is it a wilful distortion, or is it simply a major miscalculation? Who in his or her right mind would even want to rule this imperfect and complicated world? Who would want to assume that responsibility or bear that burden?
53.	We believe that there are major contradictions between the world's two super-Powers, but that neither realistically harbours any illusions of ruling this entire planet. Each, of course, wishes to expand its sphere of influence and gain adherents to its way of life. In part, they see the world differently. We remember, however, that monarchists and republicans saw the world differently as recently as the last century.
54.	Although today's super-Powers have some different values, they also have many similar values. Unfortunately, they seldom discuss the latter. They seem to prefer focusing on the former. Also unfortunate is the fact that each seeks national security through devices which actually help create international insecurity. Their competition is indeed frightening, but at times it has actually aided the process of human development. The post-Second-World-War decolonization process is a case in point. Their co-operation could, on balance, benefit us all, although there are also circumstances in which that co-operation can work to our collective detriment. Thus we have the paradox of the rivalry between these two giants and the paradox of the impact of that rivalry on the rest of the world. Let them compete if they must, but let the competition be peaceful and full of more sound and less fury.
55.	Naturally, no sane person wants to see a military contest between these two giants. We would hope that each will pursue far gentler methods to demonstrate the professed superiority of its own social system. However, who among us can guarantee that this will be the case? Not even they can give us such assurances.
56.	Anger, stress, frustration, paranoia, runaway technology, or just a plain and simple mistake could easily trigger a disaster for mankind and end everything. There would be no future. Our children, all children, would cease to exist. Is that not a sufficiently chilling thought to cause us all to pause and think?
57.	We believe that it is impossible for either of these great Powers to dominate the other. History, particularly the history of each of these nations, teaches us that this is just not possible.
58.	An even crueller and more insidious illusion is that one of these great Powers can achieve lasting military superiority over the other. The history of the post-Second-World-War arms race instructs us that neither side can stay ahead of the other.
59.	One was first to develop nuclear weapons, but the other caught up. One was first in developing long- range intercontinental ballistic bombers, but the other caught up. One was first in deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles, but the other caught up. One was even first in space, but the other caught up. Now whatever new weapons system is deployed by one, the other soon catches up with and surpasses in destructive capabilities.
60.	For the entire world, and not just the people of those two societies, the real questions are: How much longer can we continue this madness? How many more billions of dollars and other wasted resources will be poured down the drain in pursuit of these false notions of national security?
61.	Must we sit by idly while these two Powers try to outspend each other and one tries to bankrupt the other? They both know, just as we know, that there is no such thing as a realistic defence against the horrible weapons of destruction that already exist.
62.	The only thing that makes any sense at all is an undertaking of mutual restraint. Why cannot the road to peace begin in one capital and lead to another? Why cannot the obstacles to trust and peace be seen as common obstacles to be overcome by all of us together? Whatever happened to that old saying, 'Live and let live'?
63.	Why should the citizens of one society be taught to hate the citizens of the other? Why should the children of one society be taught to fear the children of the other? Do we not, as rational, thinking human beings, have the capacity to recognize the greatness of both societies? Do they not as great societies have the capacity to think and act rationally?
64.	The threat of a nuclear holocaust unleashed by one or both of the world's super-Powers is indeed a frightening prospect. Unfortunately, it is not the only frightening prospect mankind is confronted with.
65.	Medium-size Powers and other small States also have their fingers on nuclear, chemical and bacteriological timers. Far too often, nations attach more importance to what they can destroy than to what they can create. More prestige seems to flow from the ability to instil fear than from the ability to educate, clothe, house or feed.
66.	Drought and famine plague Africa. Tropical storms lash Asia, the Pacific and the Caribbean. Earthquakes destroy South American cities. Floods ravage the lands of developed and developing countries. Sickness and disease cross all of our borders and frontiers and touch all of our citizens. All of us have our own share of natural disasters. Yet, we seem intent on searching for and creating new disasters.
67.	As if the forces of nature do not take enough lives and cause enough damage, some of us look for new man-made ways to take lives and destroy resources. Some spend excessively obscene sums of money on new weapons. Some institutionalize and expand the parameters of corruption, inefficiency and inequality, destroying, in the process, every possible avenue of escape from the cycle of poverty to which so many people are condemned. Some, through no more than their studied indifference to the plight of their fellow human beings, practise their own form of violence.
68.	Each year, the agenda of vital human concerns seems to grow and grow to almost unmanageable proportions. Few things are resolved, and few sincere efforts are made by those in whose power it lies to mobilize the international community. There seems to be greater faith placed in crisis management than in crisis avoidance.
69.	When will the few remaining States that have not yet done so finally sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea? When will there be universal participation in the vital tasks of the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea?
70.	When will there be a final commitment to abide by the international community's standards of equity with respect to the exploitation of the mineral resources of the international sea-bed? After so many years of painstaking negotiations and such careful drafting, is it not reasonable to expect nations to refrain from separate undertakings which will undermine the Convention? We urge all States to think again before acting in such a manner as to subvert this very lofty breakthrough in global economic relations.
71.	The pressing need for major economic reform is well known and has been well articulated in this and other forums time and time again. How long must the world wait for concrete measures to be taken? What calamity must occur before realism replaces myopia?
72.	The growing menace of organized crime and the international traffic in drugs threaten to engulf and destroy us all. Again we ask, what are we waiting for? Must personal crisis strike before we open our eyes to this clear and present danger?
73.	The war between Iran and Iraq drags on at a terrible cost in human life and material destruction. Why can no solution be found? How do the parties to this tragic conflict manage to replenish their respective instruments of destruction? Whose interests are served by the continuation of this senseless carnage?
74.	In the Middle East, we must ask again, why cannot the Palestinian people return to their homes and live in peace? Why must they be displaced and disenfranchised? What was their sin? How much more suffering must the people of Lebanon endure? Are there no limits?
75.	How long must the people of Cyprus be divided and their land occupied? How much longer must civil war rage in Afghanistan and external forces intervene, both overtly and covertly? How much longer must the peoples of the Indo-Chinese peninsula endure warfare, economic deprivation and the Machiavellian intrigues of those who use them cynically to continue their own proxy wars? How much longer must the nations of Central America and the Caribbean endure ill-disguised interference in their internal affairs and blatant violations of the most fundamental tenets of international law? How much longer must the people of Namibia and the people of South Africa be victimized by the very fascism and racism the Organization was formed as an alliance against?
76.	Let us not suffer from historical amnesia. South Africa is an openly racist regime which was imposed and is maintained by force and violence. It was illegitimately conceived and constituted. And it continues consistently to violate major principles of the Charter of the United Nations, fundamental provisions of international law and standards of common decency and civilization.
77.	In short, in a very real and meaningful sense, it is a bandit regime which has institutionalized and elevated to State level the very terrorism every nation in this chamber condemns. How, then, can some continue to rationalize and excuse the actions of that State? How, then, can some continue to qualify their support for the General Assembly's resolutions because of what they term 'imperfect language'?
78.	How, then, can some support armed insurrection in Afghanistan, but not in South Africa? How, then, can some support armed struggle against the Government of Nicaragua, but not against the terrorists in power in Pretoria? How can those who have helped make South Africa strong and its neighbours weak applaud South Africa's ability temporarily to impose its will through the use of its military and economic might? How can those who trade with South Africa by choice equate their actions with those who are compelled to deal with South Africa?
79.	Finally, what will those who today are indifferent to the plight of the people of South Africa—all of the people of South Africa—say to those people when they finally do triumph and drive the Fascists from power? Will they then claim to have always sup-ported and loved the people of South Africa, as they now claim to have always loved and supported the people of other countries who have succeeded in overthrowing their own dictators?
80.	For us, declarations of any kind can never substitute for action. With respect to southern Africa, we do what we can. Our major regret is that we can do no more. Perhaps our greatest contribution lies in our efforts to make Vanuatu a better society and to promise our people a brighter future than the current regime in South Africa is able to promise all of the people of that troubled land. We wish that those who have it in their power to change South Africa peacefully would use that power.
81.	In the absence of such action, we believe that the international community is left with no alternative but to support the liberation movements of Namibia and South Africa. SWAPO and the African National Congress of South Africa are in reality acting for all of us. They are, in effect, soldiers of the United Nations, fighting to defend and uphold the Charter and our declarations.
82.	At every session of the General Assembly, most of the nations of the world declare their opposition to certain policies of the Government of Israel and of the Government of South Africa. We believe that most mean what they say. We also believe that most act accordingly and do not themselves define a person's worth or rights of citizenship on the basis of race, religion, sex or economic or social class. After all, how can we condemn the exclusionary policies of one State and then practise our own forms of exclusion or condone those of others?
83.	For a few, however, the denunciations of Israel and South Africa are mere rituals. Those States are among those who live by the familiar adage, 'Do as we say, not as we do'. For them, there is little meaning or substance to their declarations on Israel or South Africa. They are merely reciting well-rehearsed and politically expedient words.
84.	In our region, there is such a State. There is a large country many times more powerful than its neighbours. There is also a country whose anti- colonial history we have long admired and respected. However, an outstanding anti-colonial past is not sufficient to justify or excuse the excesses that State is committing today.
85.	We regret that there is some justification to the Israeli and South African complaint that the international community is very selective in its denunciations. It pains us deeply that there is, indeed, a grain of truth in this argument. How else can we explain the condemnations of the annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights but the silence on the annexation of East Timor? How else can we explain the condemnations of apartheid but the silence of the plight of the Melanesian people of West Papua?
86.	How else can we explain the appeals for the severance of economic ties with south Africa while a South African company participates in the exploitation of West Papua's oil resources? How else can we explain the concern over Israeli and South African military expansionism and the indifference to the military expansionism in our region which has seen West Papua and East Timor swallowed, if not digested, and which now provokes and threatens the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our good neighbour, Papua New Guinea?
87.	We are prepared to wait for answers to these questions. However, we caution the international community not to wait too long lest another South Pacific nation be threatened with extinction.
88.	In the Pacific, the valid exercise of the right of self-determination for peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories continues to be a major regional concern. Our region now has the largest number of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Our region is also probably the least known, the least discussed and the least understood of all the regions and sub regions represented here in this world body.
89.	Thus far, the process of decolonization in our region has, for the most part, been relatively peaceful and conducted in a climate of tranquillity and good will. East Timor and West Papua are the major exceptions and are also the areas in which the process has, through the intervention of an outside Power, been aborted. It is our belief, however, that this is only temporary. Assure the people of those lands that they will be allowed to express themselves freely and we believe that they will end their resistance, which is a product of the violence visited upon them by an outside Power.
90.	Some may be surprised to hear us speak of outside intervention, violence and resistance in those Territories, because few outsiders have been allowed to visit and none have been permitted to take anything but strictly guided tours. Even humanitarian organizations have been denied access. Almost a decade ago, in East Timor, journalists who were nationals of another neighbouring country were murdered as they attempted to report on the fate of East Timor's people in the face of massive military intervention.
91.	Some may have forgotten, but we have not forgotten. Some may feel that we should forget, but we cannot. We cannot forget how and why these men lost their lives any more than we can forget what is being inflicted on our fellow Melanesians in West Papua and on the Maubere people of East Timor. It is our policy to support the wishes and aspirations of all peoples in the Pacific. Cynics may think otherwise, but we believe that the peoples of East Timor, West Papua, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia and Micronesia are as capable as anyone else in this forum when it comes to determining their own futures. Whenever possible, we counsel and encourage them to pursue the path of dialogue and peaceful negotiations, but we also know that they must have someone with whom to have a dialogue and negotiate. Let us not prejudge the results, but let there be a valid process.
92.	Our region is known for its calm and serene atmosphere. The countries of the South Pacific are populated by peace-loving people of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. However, our similar colonial histories have instilled in us all a strong aversion to external interference and foreign rule. On this we are in total accord. Unfortunately, the international community has not yet taking note of it. Thus, while our support is given as a matter of principle to the struggle against apartheid, little is known of our own struggle against the same practices in our own region. Although our support is solicited for resolutions on Afghanistan and Kampuchea, not a thought is given to our concerns in our immediate region.
93.	Far too often, short-sightedness, inflexibility and parochialism have obliged colonized peoples to resort to the politics of confrontation in order to achieve justice, self-determination and independence. The voices of moderation are seldom heeded until it is far too late.
94.	The people of New Caledonia have now asked for what has always been theirs—the right to deter-mine their own future. The administering Power has recognized that New Caledonia's people have their right, and we commend the administering Power for its realism and its apparent willingness to co-operate. However, it is our sincere belief that time is of the essence. The administering Power must, we believe, negotiate a timetable and mode of self-expression that is acceptable to New Caledonia's colonized people. Failure to do so will only encourage extremist elements amongst the settler population and lead to the type of confrontation all rational persons seek to avoid.
95.	As New Caledonia's immediate neighbour, Vanuatu is concerned about the maintenance of peace and stability. However, we also recognize that a speedy redress of the grievances of New Caledonia's people is the surest way to guarantee peace and stability.
96.	The Governments of the South Pacific Forum have noted the constitutional and electoral reforms which have been introduced. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum, however, we cannot under-stand why a referendum on the future constitutional status of New Caledonia cannot be held prior to 1989. With other Forum members, therefore, we urge the administering Power to move the date forward and to announce that independence is the logical outcome of the planned referendum. We also believe that additional political and administrative powers should be transferred to New Caledonia to ensure that it is adequately prepared for independence.
97.	The nations of our region are in agreement that colonialism has no future in the South Pacific. We will do all that we can to ensure a peaceful transition to independence in New Caledonia. However, all must understand that independence is on the immediate agenda. The Kanak people have made that crystal clear. Let us now work together to ensure that all will live and prosper in harmony.
98.	The denuclearization of the Pacific is, to some, an abstract idea. To us, a small island developing State in the region, it is a crucial ingredient for our survival. We are aware of the connection between the colonial and nuclear policies of certain Powers which are currently undertaking various nuclear activities in our region. We note with extreme disappointment that the consistent objections raised by the Governments and peoples of the South Pacific to certain nuclear activities seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Thus, testing of nuclear weapons continues, and it is still proposed that our waters be used for dumping nuclear wastes.
99.	Arguments of relative safety do not impress us. Who can truthfully state with absolutely no equivocation that our environment will not be harmed by these activities? We know that the proponents of these activities do not even understand our environment, and we seriously doubt that their scientists ever will either. We are at peace with our environment, while they seem to be at war with theirs.
100.	Accordingly, our Parliament has resolved unanimously to declare Vanuatu a nuclear-free State. We have therefore established a policy of not allowing nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed vessels to call at any of our ports. We are deeply committed to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in our region, and this is one step in that direction.
101.	History teaches us that every weapon mankind has developed has eventually been used. The human race is now at a turning point. We, the Governments and peoples of this earth, must let our would-be protectors know that reasoning and understanding are better protectors of human life than any weapons system devised or yet to be devised by the military- industrial complex.
102.	In our search for justice, we must leave no stone unturned. In our search for equality, we must leave no stone unturned. In our search for peace, we must also leave no stone unturned. We must remember that we live in an imperfect world, and that we are imperfect beings. Only the most arrogant of us believe that we can pass judgement on our Creator's work. We must learn to respect our differences and our frailties. We must learn to draw comfort from our universality. Patience is needed as we try to understand each other.
103.	Perhaps we would be well advised to remember the biblical admonition, 'Let him who is without sin cast the first stone'. If we, the nations of the world, live by these words, there will be no stones cast, and this world might just survive.
"
2581,50,1995,PNG,"It is an
honour for me to address this Assembly on behalf of
Papua New Guinea and in my capacity as the Chairman
of the South Pacific Forum, which met three weeks ago.
At the outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Diogo
Freitas do Amaral upon his election to preside over the
General Assembly at this session, which also marks the
fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations; and to
congratulate also his predecessor for the efficiency and
fairness with which he conducted the forty-ninth session.
In my capacity as the Chairman of the South Pacific
Forum and on behalf of Papua New Guinea, I warmly
welcome the Republic of Palau, a sister country from our
region, as the 185th Member of the United Nations.


As we mark this fiftieth anniversary, our celebrations
are tempered by the fact that many of the dreams and ideals
of the United Nations remain elusive. A world of greater
freedom, prosperity and security - the fundamental goals of
the United Nations Charter - unfortunately has not yet been
attained. Much remains to be achieved by the United
Nations, and that, to a great degree, depends on the
collective support of each and every Member nation.
Papua New Guinea retains a strong belief that the
international community cannot do without the United
Nations, despite its shortcomings. If it was necessary in the
aftermath of the Second World War, it is even more so
today. In 50 years, the United Nations has contributed
immensely to positive international interactions and has
provided the codes of conduct that today we take for
granted in our international dealings.
As one of many countries governed under the watchful
eye of the United Nations before becoming a full Member
at independence, Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to
rejuvenating and strengthening the world’s paramount
international Organization.
Everything that needs to be said for the good of
humanity has been said many times over in this very Hall.
Noble and practical sentiments have always been expressed,
often in the strongest terms. What too often have been
lacking are political will and international statesmanship.
Therein lies the difference between wishful thinking and
turning our hopes and dreams for humanity into reality.
On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the
United Nations, I am proud to say that Papua New Guinea
pledges full commitment to the principles and objectives of
the Organization.
We should together strive to build a better world for
this generation and for those to come, in the next 50 years
and beyond. In areas where the United Nations has been
successful, we have to recommit ourselves, and where it
has not been successful, now is the time to correct and
rebuild inadequate systems. Our ultimate objective must be
to promote a more effective, more accountable, more
responsible and more caring United Nations, capable of
meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.
We must consider very carefully how we should usher
in and embrace the twenty-first century. The end of one
century and the beginning of another provides us with a
natural period of reflection and self-examination. It is time
to resolve to untangle, and rid ourselves of, all that has
stopped us from creating a better world.
For that reform, we require a fresh start with greater
determination, less cynicism, and hearts open more widely
to the plight of all humanity. That is our collective
challenge between now and the year 2000. The
international community must demonstrate the necessary
resolve, courage, vision and moral will to make this world
a better place.
In setting the agenda for a better future, we must
first understand our shared history. We must know that
within the United Nations, our collective search for true
peace is deeply rooted in events that took place just
months before this Organization came into existence.
I speak of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. They did not just change our world forever —
these events changed the very way we think. Effectively
the closing acts of the Second World War, they forced
upon the world an urgency in the search for peace. It is
an urgency that has never been lost, as morality and the
heart of man battle to keep pace with technology in all its
forms.
It is a race that the United Nations is running. It is
a race that it cannot afford to lose.
If peace is in the hearts of men, and men in turn are
the heart of nations, and nations the heart of the world,
then we must fully realize just how profound a change we
must undergo to find true peace. The extent to which the
world discovers and embraces peace will be reflected in
the way it faces up to other threats to humanity.
One of the challenges that I believe is eating away
at the health and lives of all nations is the abuse of
drugs — and it truly is a world problem.
The drug trade preys upon the youth of the world,
shattering the lives of individuals and the peace and
prosperity of communities. It has truly established its own
foul “united nations”.
The criminals — and they are criminals of the
lowest order — have broken down barriers of nationality,
politics, race, religion and culture far more successfully
than has this Assembly, as they ply their evil trade.
The networks they have established make
multinational corporate giants look like small players, and
2


have become so entrenched that they can be met only with
an equally determined and broad-based international
response.
That task must be placed at the door of the United
Nations because, quite simply, no other group, no nation,
can take them on alone.
Victory in the battle against the drug barons will
require the same qualities needed in every other serious
endeavour of the United Nations — political will and
collective determination. Without these factors, we risk
losing generations to destructive substance abuse. The price
is too high. We must fight as one against this evil.
It is battles such as this that collectively we must take
up. If we do not commit ourselves to fights for decency
such as this one, we will never find the courage required to
attain true life and peace in this world.
On the question of the expansion of the Security
Council membership, we urge the five permanent members
of the Council to join us in looking critically at the
continuing relevance of their privileged positions and to
consider how the Security Council might operate more
effectively.
Papua New Guinea fully supports the permanent
membership of Japan and Germany on the Security
Council.
We are also aware of the need to support shared
objectives and decisions with adequate resources. We are
especially concerned that the ongoing financial difficulties
should be resolved promptly, so that the United Nations can
function to its full capacity.
No one should rest satisfied while we are faced with
the perpetuation of social and economic disparities between
and within nations — largely the result of parochial
interests being pursued at the expense of genuine human
concerns.
It is precisely this short-sightedness that has resulted
in United Nations failure in some areas in the past.
Decency and justice must prevail in fact, and not just
in words.
Papua New Guinea, as an active participant in and
beneficiary of the Lome Convention between the European
Union (EU) and the African Caribbean Pacific Group of
States (ACP), is greatly honoured to currently hold the
presidency and the chairmanship of all Lome Convention
institutions, including the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, the
ACP Council of Ministers and the ACP Committee of
Ambassadors.
We feel confident that we will play a substantive
role, under the Lome Convention, in addressing these
inequities. We are also hopeful that the international trade
and economic situation will improve with the advent of
the World Trade Organization, with protections to ensure
that the weak are not manipulated by the strong.
The problems of debt management and servicing
continue to plague many developing countries. In trying
to address them, we do not believe there are universal
solutions. Every case must be dealt with individually and
on its own merits. To do otherwise will simply cause
serious social and political dislocation.
In this regard, international lending institutions such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) should demonstrate the requisite sensitivity and
tact. We do not believe there is a single recipe for all
problems, particularly as they relate to structural
adjustment programmes of the type which we in Papua
New Guinea have only recently ploughed through and
adopted, after refinements to meet our own particular
circumstances.
We live in a rapidly changing world, and it is a
world dogged by confusion and distortion as it struggles
to set new bounds of acceptability and compatibility.
With the decline of the cold war, our optimistic
hearts thought we might at long last enter a period of
peace, security and prosperity. Much of that optimism has
today given way to doubt and concern.
The challenge to the resolve and the resources of the
United Nations is arguably as great as it has ever been —
in Bosnia, the former Soviet Union, Rwanda, Somalia and
elsewhere.
Some of these trouble-spots have highlighted the
United Nations problems and been a source of acute
embarrassment to the United Nations, which has too often
been reduced to shameful impotence. The tragedy — the
overwhelming tragedy — of this is that lives have been
lost; people have died in huge numbers. The simple fact
is that so many of them would still be alive today if the
3


United Nations had more effectively fulfilled its role once
it had decided to intervene.
When we lay this accusation at the door of the United
Nations, let us make no mistake about it: we do not and
cannot distance ourselves from these failings. We, the
members, are the United Nations. We are responsible for
what it does, or fails to do. We must lay much blame at the
door of the Member States which, collectively, have so
lacked political will and moral courage.
The reforms that will bring about increased political
will and a more humanitarian view must occur within each
and every Member nation. As the United Nations celebrates
its fiftieth anniversary, we would like to stress that if it
wants to be a true world forum, then it should exclude no
country, large or small.
At a time when reconciliation is superseding
confrontation the United Nations, in accordance with the
spirit of preventive diplomacy, should do its best to ease
the tensions between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. Peace
and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region are at stake.
On a global scale, we thought there was a hope for
peace and prosperity on the horizon when the international
community gathered in Rio for the Earth Summit on
Environment and Sustainable Development.
We all pledged and acknowledged at the Rio Summit
that something had to be done, because humanity was
endangered by environmental degradation and climate
change, and we adopted “Agenda 21” as the framework
document.
All Governments took the document firmly in hand,
but sadly their grip today appears to have slackened.
This experience and others call into question the
usefulness of further global conferences, when the results
of the ones already held are so generally disappointing.
We have had all the special world conferences, such
as the ones in Barbados on small island developing States,
in Cairo on population, in Copenhagen on social issues, in
Berlin on climate change and the recent Fourth World
Conference on Women, held in Beijing — although in
fairness to the latter, we should give it more time to
produce results. We should consider a moratorium on such
gatherings until we begin to see practical benefits coming
through. The talking has been done; it is now time for
action.
Environmental issues have become an all-
encompassing international agenda. In the context of an
interdependent world, we have a collective responsibility
guided by the framework of international conventions to
manage and develop our resources sustainably. The goals
of sustainable development can be realized only through
effective intergovernmental cooperation and through
regional and international efforts.
For its part, the South Pacific Forum, made up of 16
nations, including Palau, which joined at the most recent
Forum, has adopted both national and regional strategies
to develop and implement environmentally sound
programmes. Together with our fellow members of the
Melanesian Spearhead Group, we have become party to
the Lakatoro Declaration on Oceania Cooperation on
Denuclearization.
Papua New Guinea and the other 15 members of the
South Pacific Forum recently expressed extreme outrage
at the French Government’s resumption of nuclear testing
at Mururoa and resolved to review the status of their
dialogue with France. In total disregard of our stand,
France detonated its second nuclear test, at Fangataufa
Atoll, at 9.30 a.m., Papua New Guinea time, on Monday,
2 October 1995. Consistent with the resolution of the
South Pacific Forum nations, I now, regrettably, in my
capacity as Chairman of the Forum, announce the
suspension forthwith of all post-Forum dialogue with
France.
I am pleased to report that the twenty-sixth South
Pacific Forum paid close attention to the changed regional
and world security situation. The Forum’s concept paper
“Securing Development Beyond 2000” looked at security
issues well beyond the scope of military threats and
military solutions. We focused on increasing security on
a sustainable basis by promoting trade, transport and
tourism in and for our region. We addressed the need for
regional arrangements on environmental damage, natural
disasters and other emergencies; as a result, we are
working to have a comprehensive and detailed plan of
action for the region.
That is a Forum document to which we are party;
but for Papua New Guinea’s part, we have our own
national guiding document, “The Pacific Plan”, for our
relations with our Pacific neighbours.
In considering Pacific issues, the Forum was
conscious that small island States are very vulnerable and
have unusual needs. Their economies are constantly under
4


threat from natural disasters such as cyclones, volcanoes
and the looming danger of rising sea levels. When such
States are hit by cyclones, it is akin to the ravages of war,
and their economies and infrastructures face severe strains
that seriously hamper and set back their development.
Papua New Guinea therefore appeals to the international
community to render support consistent with the Barbados
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of
Small Island Developing States to assist their efforts to
achieve greater self-reliance.
Small nations, including many in the Pacific, have
suffered from declining international concern since the end
of the cold war. Geo-economic considerations have largely
replaced the geo-political considerations of the past, with
new webs of alignment replacing the old and familiar ones.
This has forced regionalistic tendencies upon nations, which
in some respects has crippled moves towards a true global
partnership.
Member nations will be aware of the internal crisis
that Papua New Guinea has faced on Bougainville, one that
has demanded enormous energy, time, patience and
resources from the Government of my country. I am
pleased to inform the Assembly that my Government, since
taking office in August of last year, has wholeheartedly
sought a successful resolution to the Bougainville situation,
so far with notable success. Please allow me to express the
appreciation of the people and the Government of Papua
New Guinea to the United Nations, and to the
Secretary-General’s office in particular, for the cooperation
and understanding extended to us throughout this process.
I am thinking particularly of the support the United Nations
offered to the Bougainville Peace Conference of October
last year, which, I am pleased to say, with the coming
together of the South Pacific peace-keeping force, put flesh
on the words of the Secretary-General on the value of
regional approaches to conflict resolution. I believe that
today the benefits of that wise policy are there for all to see
in the situation on Bougainville, which has vastly improved
over the past 12 months.
We also wish to assure the international community of
our absolute commitment to human rights in dealing with
this situation, as guaranteed in our Constitution. Indeed, it
is a fundamental regard for the right of all our people to
live free and peaceful lives that has driven me and my
Government to search tirelessly for a resolution to this
crisis.
There is no such thing as a minority group in Papua
New Guinea because we come from numerous and diverse
linguistic, cultural and social backgrounds. We have over
800 tribes and languages among 4 million people, in a
country the size of Malaysia. In effect, we are all
minorities in our land. As such, every group has a
legitimate place in Papua New Guinea.
For us and for other developing nations, the focus of
social issues falls squarely on the question of empowering
people to eradicate poverty, get an education and live
healthy lives. When that is achieved, the people are then
in a position to expand their participation in the social
and economic development of their nation. Without those
basics, theirs is simply a battle for survival.
Increasing marginalization of the poor and of
minorities remains a major problem within every country,
regardless of economic or political status. We support the
view that a new paradigm of development has to redefine
the needs of people in terms of securing the basics of life
such as housing, food and water. This can be achieved
only by empowering people through decision-making and
through direct participation in the development process.
In that connection, I wish to draw the attention of
the Assembly to a report to be prepared by the
Secretary-General on the United Nations initiative on
opportunity and participation, which I hope will receive
the serious consideration it deserves.
One of the hallmarks of United Nations achievement
has been the decolonization of peoples under colonial
domination. As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary
of the United Nations, we can proudly testify that the
United Nations has generally fulfilled its duties and
responsibilities with respect to the decolonization process.
My country and many others represented in this Hall are
testimony to the honourable achievements of this
Organization in decolonization. Less than three weeks ago
my people joyfully celebrated the twentieth anniversary of
the independence of Papua New Guinea.
While we acknowledge and commend the United
Nations for its decolonization achievements, its task is not
yet complete. There are still many Territories under
colonial domination of one form or another. In
recognition of the unfinished task relating to colonialism,
the General Assembly has adopted a resolution
proclaiming the International Decade for the Eradication
of Colonialism. This carries great hope for those who are
still under the yoke of colonialism.
5


The end of apartheid in South Africa brought a great
sense of relief and enlightenment, not just there but
throughout the world. In that vein, colonialism — another
blight on humanity — should be done away with and
consigned to the pages of history as a degrading
phenomenon of a bygone age.
There is a need to take a case-by-case approach in
addressing the problems of the Territories under colonial
administration to ensure that the wishes of the people
concerned are adequately and realistically taken into
account in determining their eventual political status.
In our immediate region, we are keen to see the
decolonization process in New Caledonia allowed to take its
due course, consistent with United Nations principles and
practices. While we acknowledge the progressive attitude
taken by the French Government with regard to New
Caledonia, we are concerned that certain negative and
counter-productive policies still exist. In that regard, we call
on France to fulfil its decolonization responsibilities quickly
and with dignity.
The eradication of colonialism before the year 2000
will place us on a more enlightened plateau. It will make
the world a better place, more equipped to take on the
challenges of the future with justice and dignity for all.
The United Nations undoubtedly stands for humanity.
It provides the best possible avenue to peace, security and
prosperity. While we all acknowledge the worthy objectives
of the United Nations Charter, no country can claim that it
has given full and complete support to the Organization.
Unfortunately, the United Nations has time and again
been used for parochial pursuits, whether in respect of
peace-keeping, human rights or environmental areas or in
Security Council deliberations. In this very imperfect world,
it would be naive to have ever expected perfect solutions
from the United Nations. I say again that it is, however, an
Organization that my Government strongly believes the
international community cannot do without. If the United
Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it. Fifty
years on, our task is to reinvent it, to make it better, to
allow it to fully and ably serve humanity. This is a most
noble goal that must be pursued with pragmatic intensity
and determination.
The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations is the
time for each and every Member nation to recommit itself
to the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter. We must do it for peace, and with the vivid
recollection of Hiroshima and Nagasaki never far way. If
we are to welcome the new century as we should, then
the United Nations Charter provides the yardstick for the
challenges ahead.
There are many global issues confronting us today,
and the United Nations provides us with the best
chance — the only chance — of handling them
successfully. So let us act for the sake of all humanity. In
this global age we must mend our ways. We must think
with global heads and attend to humanity’s needs with
global hearts. Only then will our attitudes have kept pace
with the realities we face. Only then can we leave a better
world for our children.
"
2596,50,1995,MHL,"Please permit me to
offer you, Mr. President, our congratulations on your
election to your high office and to assure you of our
support and cooperation.
To the Secretary-General we wish to express our
highest regards and admiration for his leadership; and to the
President of the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session,
our deep appreciation for his contribution.
This is also a most fitting occasion for me personally
to congratulate our brother and neighbour in the Pacific the
Republic of Palau on becoming a full Member of the
United Nations. My delegation eagerly looks forward to
working closely with that country.
Today, as we celebrate the passing of 50 years since
the creation of the United Nations, we must also reflect on
the events associated with the purpose for which this body
was created. The havoc wreaked upon humanity by the
Second World War prompted the founding fathers to devise
an instrument to ensure a stable world and a better future.
My purpose today is, first, to recognize those areas
in which this body has undertaken some major initiatives
in various sectors that are of great and direct significance
to us in the Marshall Islands. I also will state briefly
some of our concerns with respect to our membership in
the United Nations, and then I intend to raise those issues
whose implications have critical consequences for our
survival in our country. As members will note, some of
these have been raised a number of times in this forum
during the past sessions of this body.
This year, the completion of the United Nations
Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly
Migratory Fish Stocks is of particular importance to my
country, and my Government intends to sign and ratify
the agreement, which was finalized this summer. We are
indebted to the very able leadership of the Chairman,
Ambassador Nandan, from Fiji. The Marshall Islands has
given its full support to the Ambassador in his
candidature to the post of Secretary General of the
International Seabed Authority.
I wish to acknowledge the support we have received
from the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts of the
Climate Change Convention. The scientific evidence we
received from them in order adequately to address the
Convention confirmed our belief in the existence of such
phenomena as sea-level rise in many of our low-lying
islands and in our region.
We are particularly concerned by the strong
possibility that the Alliance of Small Island States


(AOSIS) Protocol, now known as the Berlin Mandate,
might be derailed because of intransigent short-term
economic interests. Such a possibility, arising solely from
the desire to facilitate the selling of more oil, if real,
imperils our very survival. We will not accept such a
condition and we urge that interference and delaying tactics
that hamper the work of AOSIS and other concerned
countries should cease. The increasing level of destruction
caused by hurricanes and storms is a clear signal that the
matter is urgent. We have deep sympathy with our friends
in the Caribbean countries and in the United States who
were recently struck by this devastation.
The follow-up of the Global Conference on the
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States
that was held in Barbados last year will be looked at during
this General Assembly session. The comprehensive and
ambitious programme involved has received the
wholehearted endorsement and support of the Marshall
Islands Government. In this regard, may I extend our warm
thanks to the Chairman of AOSIS, Her Excellency
Ambassador Annette des Iles of Trinidad and Tobago, for
all her efforts.
My Government also looks forward to receiving the
recommendations of the Fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing last month. We will work closely
with the United Nations to ensure that the recommendations
articulated in the Conference are appropriately addressed.
Mr. President, we endorse without hesitation the
concern expressed in your statement in September of this
year, in which you stated: “Efforts must be made to ensure
that all States that are not yet Members should seek to be
admitted in the near future” (Official Records of the
General Assembly, Fiftieth Session, Plenary Meetings,
1st meeting, p. 7)
In the light of this view, the reasons underlying the
inability of many of these nations to become Members of
the United Nations should be examined. My delegation
feels that the unfair burden that is borne by many of the
less developed countries with respect to the current system
of assessing the scale of contributions to the regular budget
and for peace-keeping operations deters others from seeking
their rightful place in this community of nations.
The Marshall Islands participated actively in the High-
level Open-ended Working Group on the Financial Situation
of the United Nations, and we concur fully with the
recommendation that the current floor rate should either be
abolished, reduced substantially, or be designed according
to a formula by which a country is assessed on the basis
of its capacity to pay. A decision to that effect by the
General Assembly at this session will undoubtedly help
expedite the realization of the goal that you,
Mr. President, envisioned.
The current inequities with respect to the existing
floor rate have also been noted in a number of reports,
including that of the Committee on Contributions. My
delegation strongly urges the United Nations to take
action on the recommendations made by that Committee
as soon as possible.
The need to undertake certain structural reforms
within the United Nations in order to make it more
efficient and responsive to the changing needs of present-
day society is critical. One such area which should be
closely looked at is the Security Council, where the
concept of permanent membership does not, in our view,
constitute fair democratic representation. We are,
however, aware of the differences in capabilities which
exist among nations. We are aware, too, of the need for
this issue to be carefully weighed and believe that
possible solutions, including Italy’s proposal for a more
formal set of subgroups or constituencies, should be
seriously studied. This would be particularly helpful
within our own regional group. We are hopeful that the
High-level Working Group on the Security Council will
act with wise expediency to devise viable and acceptable
solutions to this important issue.
We are also carefully studying the various reports
and proposals developed by different groups on the work
of other agencies of the United Nations. One aspect which
we consider to be of great importance is the need to
determine whether the existence of some of the agencies
realistically justifies the resources provided for their
support. We must arrive at a frank assessment of whether
the tasks entrusted to an agency are actually carried out
in a meaningful way, and what that work produces in
terms of results. As long as this issue remains
inadequately addressed, the climate of resentment and
suspicion will persist and may give rise to adverse effects
on the level of contributions needed to support the work
of the United Nations. We must make urgent progress to
complete this task of reform.
The Convention on Biological Diversity and its
fundamental tenet regarding the conservation and
sustainable use of our resources is under serious threat
from human activities. Evidence derived from data
gathered in our country suggests in no uncertain terms
2


that nuclear contaminants resulting directly from nuclear-
weapons tests conducted in our country have entered our
basic food chain, upon which our very livelihood depends
causing, among other things, extensive health risks.
We must also pause and reflect on the plight of those
groups of victims who, while the rest of the world was
enjoying the benefits and freedom of the post-war period,
were themselves caught between the crossfire of super-
Power rivalries. One such unfortunate group was the people
of the Marshall Islands.
We are steadily unravelling the large amount of
information now available to us on the nature and
consequences of nuclear testing activities carried out in the
Marshall Islands. We are deeply disturbed and alarmed at
what we are uncovering. For in addition to the unfortunate
nuclear tests, we unearthed something just as horrifying as
the nuclear tests themselves, if not more so. It grieves me
immeasurably to report today that in one of the Trusteeship
documents we discovered it was confirmed that in a
meeting held in New York on 10 May 1954, the Secretary-
General of the United Nations agreed at the urging of the
then United States Ambassador, Mr. Lodge, to withhold
from circulation to Member States a petition from the
Marshall Islands. The Marshallese petition, which pleaded
with the United Nations to put an immediate halt to the
tests was to be withheld by the Secretary-General pending
the completion of the test series. In this petition, the people
of the Marshall Islands, through their leaders, had expressed
their genuine fears and concerns to the only world
institution they believed could help them. In return,
however, the high executives in this institution not only
failed to consider this a matter of any significant
importance, but actually engaged in an act most unbefitting
the integrity of this august body.
The ethical implications of this act, unimaginable as
they may be, are obvious. Nevertheless, I am raising the
issue, and I can assure the Assembly that we shall continue
to do so in various United Nations and other international
forums. We shall do so until the international community
takes action to address our concerns and until this
Organization acknowledges the support lent by high
officials to nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands.
We want to bring to the attention of the international
community the reality and the magnitude of the effect of
these tests on our health, our environment and our future
development as a nation. We also want it to become aware
of our daily struggle to cope with a situation whose
radiation-induced nature continues to haunt us, whose
complexity in terms of solutions is far beyond our
capacity to handle and whose conception was solely for
the purpose of countering hostilities and tensions that bore
no relationship whatsoever to the Marshall Islands.
And so I ask Member States, when they hear us
speaking out about the perils of radiation, to think about
these in terms of human suffering and to try to visualize
Marshallese children being born faceless, with no bones,
or with missing or extra limbs — the jellyfish babies, as
some have come to call them — and the irreparable
damage wreaked upon the reproductive health of their
mothers.
It would be remiss of me, however, not to
acknowledge some of the efforts made by the former
Trustee in addressing our health and environmental
problems caused by radioactive contaminants. We also
feel that the international community has an obligation to
take serious note of our concerns, as well as to undertake
a leading and active role in ensuring that an acceptable
process, designed to restore the Marshall Islands to
habitable conditions, is effectively and expeditiously set
in motion. We were, after all, entrusted by the United
Nations itself, and so this body had the moral obligation
and the irrefutable responsibility at the time of testing to
oversee these activities and to make our safety its primary
concern. The same moral obligation, in our view, remains
binding even today.
Perhaps one of the most gratifying things
occurring — which, I might add, is giving us a ray of
hope — is that there is now a growing consciousness of
the fact that nothing short of a collective effort is needed
in order to focus on this issue. That some nations are
beginning, although slowly, to understand and sympathize
with our plight is most encouraging. This consciousness
is clearly reflected in their willingness to incorporate our
concerns into pertinent and relevant international texts. I
should like to cite some examples.
The Review and Extension Conference of the States
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, for example, took special note of the
international community’s responsibility to assist the
inhabitants and restore the environment of the former
United Nations Trust Territories that were adversely
affected by nuclear-weapons-testing programmes.
The Fourth World Conference on Women, held this
year in Beijing, recognized that the concept and practice
of environmental degradation are incongruent with
3


development and that the use and testing of nuclear
weapons are undeniably one factor in the destruction of the
environment, the displacement of people and the creation of
high health risks.
The South Pacific Forum, held last month in Papua
New Guinea, called upon all Governments and international
organizations with expertise in the field of clean-up and the
disposal of radioactive contaminants to give appropriate
assistance for remedial purposes when so requested by
affected countries. The Forum also noted the existence of
a special responsibility towards those peoples of the former
United Nations Trust Territory administered by the United
States that had been adversely affected by nuclear-weapon
tests conducted during the period of the Trusteeship. This
responsibility includes the safe resettlement of displaced
human populations and the restoration to economic
productivity of affected areas, the provision of adequate
health care and compensation for the loss of life, land and
health.
During the post-Forum dialogue in Papua New Guinea
our former Trustee — the United States — took the
position that it would not stand in the way of the Marshall
Islands’ exploring the question of or soliciting assistance
from other countries or organizations for the purposes of
the disposal of radioactive contaminants, the resettlement of
affected populations and the economic restoration of the
environment. Our sincere hope, however, is that the United
States will not take its advocating of such a position as an
opportunity to bow out of its obligations. It is our hope that
it will, instead, redouble its efforts and, with the assistance
of other nations and international bodies, lend its full
support for the goal of making our country free of
radioactive contaminants.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the
current Administration for its willingness to acknowledge
the United States Government’s role in using human beings
for radiation experiments, including at least two confirmed
instances of medical research, which did not provide any
direct benefit to Marshallese subjects.
The unearthing of these horrendous activities is an act
of political courage on President Clinton’s part. For the
Marshall Islands, the White House Advisory Committee on
Human Radiation Experiments uncovered vital information
about the effect of radiation on people and the environment.
The Marshall Islands appreciates the United States
Government’s recognition that the now infamous Bravo
blast was not the only weapon that exposed the Marshallese
people and environment to radiation. It is worth bearing in
mind that, while Bravo was the equivalent of 1,000
Hiroshima bombs, the total megaton equivalent of
weapons tested in the Marshall Islands exceeded 7,000
Hiroshima bombs.
It is an important step in our countries’ bilateral
relations that we can now begin to broaden our discussion
of exposure. Exposure will never again be defined in
terms of fallout from Bravo alone, but will now
incorporate the cumulative effects of all the tests and the
effects of residual contamination in the environment. The
Marshall Islands looks forward to continuing to work with
the United States Congress and the Clinton
Administration to ensure that the recommendations of the
Advisory Committee are fully implemented — including
the recommendation concerning whether it would be
appropriate to add the populations of other atolls to the
south and east of the blasts that have shown excessive
thyroid abnormalities. We hope that the international
community will give these efforts its full support.
As if our own four decades of painful experience
with the dreadful business of nuclear testing were not
enough, there appeared once again this year in our
beautiful Pacific the trauma of yet a further series of
nuclear tests, intended to continue until May next year. I
refer of course to the French resumption this year of
nuclear testing at Mururoa. It is probably because we are
far removed from metropolitan centres that there is a
tendency for certain people to look at the Pacific as the
“ideal desert” for nuclear testing, as one French official
recently put it. Often overlooked too is the fact that all
island nations spread out across the length and breadth of
the Pacific are connected by this mighty ocean. Nuclear
damage to one island nation poses immense long-term
implications and dangers to others in the region.
As people who are living the nightmarish experience
of nuclear testing, we cannot and will not accept the weak
argument that the current tests are safe for any of our
Pacific neighbours and friends. Nor can we accept the
continuation of this irresponsible practice in the region.
We have denounced its resumption from the beginning
and will continue to do so.
We joined in support of New Zealand’s case against
France in the International Court of Justice. We took this
action with great regret since France has always been a
constructive partner in our relationship with the developed
world. It is simply incomprehensible to us that this great
nation of culture, science and fine arts could visit this
abomination upon us in the Pacific region. We protested
4


to the French authorities, but the first tests went ahead
anyway. Although the International Court of Justice
declined to hear the case, the decision was entirely based
on technicalities. France should not think that this is a
victory for it, as many of the judges pointed out that there
was a strong moral and legal background for halting the
tests. I strongly disagree with the claim made by the French
Foreign Minister here a few weeks ago — that the tests
were environmentally safe. Look at the situation I have just
described in the Marshall Islands. We have also received
documentation from a number of eminent scientists which
would, at the very least, warrant exercising caution.
Furthermore, France is a State party to the Noumea
Convention for the Protection and Development of Natural
Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region as
well as the Convention on Biological Diversity. The
principle of environmental-impact assessment and the
precautionary approach are not compatible with the
activities that it is carrying out today. The offer to carry out
an impact assessment after the tests are finished is a
ridiculous offer, since by then it might be much too late.
The tests are violating treaties and they are violating our
environment, and I also think that they are a violation of
our human rights. The tests must stop. They must stop now.
The collective voice of the leaders of the countries of
the South Pacific Forum was heard when a statement was
issued during its meeting in Papua New Guinea expressing
extreme outrage at the resumption of French nuclear testing
in the Pacific. They demanded that France desist from any
further tests. The outrage was especially compounded by
the intransigence of France, and the People’s Republic of
China, in persisting with their nuclear tests in the face of
the strong views of the Pacific region. My Government
stands by the decision announced last week by the
Chairman of the Forum, Sir Julius Chan, that France is no
longer invited to the post-Forum dialogue.
We are in full support of the extension of the Non-
Proliferation Treaty. We will also work actively to achieve
a breakthrough in the negotiations for a comprehensive test-
ban treaty. We also acknowledge the support of just, fair-
minded and world-conscious leaders and peoples, who have
condemned and continue to condemn this anachronistic
series of tests in the Pacific. We join our voice to theirs in
support.
This session provides the community of nations with
a unique opportunity to examine our past performance
record. As a world-governing institution, the United Nations
must look closely at its strengths and build upon them.
Likewise, it must pay particular attention to its
shortcomings and weaknesses so that it can continue to
provide much-needed hope, strength and direction to the
nations of the world.
"
2634,50,1995,AUS,"I congratulate Mr. Diogo
Freitas do Amaral on his election to the presidency of this
session of the General Assembly. His election is a tribute
both to him and to Portugal, and Australia will work with
him to ensure that this historic fiftieth session is as
memorable as it could possibly be.
I join in warmly welcoming, as the 185th Member
State of the United Nations, our fellow South Pacific Forum
member Palau.
If we are to effectively prepare for our future we must
first be able to clearly see our past. If we are to see where
we must go, we must know where we have been: we must
be conscious of our failures, but we should be proud of our
successes.
The structure of today’s world community — of
sovereign, self-determined, independent States working
together on the basis of equality in a framework of
international law — simply did not exist before the Charter
of the United Nations came into being. There were
imaginings of it in the minds of many for a very long time,
and we saw emerge between the two world wars a pale
approximation of it with the League of Nations. But it was
at that special moment in San Francisco, 50 years ago, that
today’s concept of a community of nations was first truly
born. And that concept has passed the test of 50 years of
life.
Gifted though the authors of the Charter were, they
would I think be awed to see how very much their vision
of a globalized world has now been answered, and
exceeded. Today’s world is one world, a world in which no
individuals and no States can aspire to solve all their
problems or fulfil all their dreams alone. The ideas of San
Francisco have entered into the unconscious of people all
over the world. Those who refuse to acknowledge the
global character of our world, or who recoil from it and
retreat into unilateralism or, worse, isolationism, have
simply not understood the new dynamics that are at work.
Ours is an age in which we are called to more, not less,
cooperation — and to ever more, and more responsible,
sharing of our common destiny.
The ideas of San Francisco have assumed many
concrete forms, which have deepened and expanded over
the last five decades. States now habitually, virtually
automatically, conduct their relations with each other on
the basis of the United Nations Charter. We have added
continually to the corpus of international law and
agreements made pursuant to the Charter, in ways that
have touched every aspect of modern life. We have built
institutions that have sought to deliver to the peoples of
the world their most basic needs — for peace and
security, for economic well-being, and for dignity and
liberty.
It was natural that following a devastating world war
and the hideous brutality which accompanied it, the
Charter would have at its heart the maintenance of
international peace and security. So far, anyway, we have
passed the test of ensuring that the world would never
again be subjected to global conflict. The United Nations
has been, of course, deeply challenged in the maintenance
of peace, from the very beginning and ever since. There
are areas in which its attempts to maintain and restore
peace have been flawed, and where the United Nations
has faltered. But for all that has gone wrong in places like
Bosnia and Somalia and Rwanda we should not forget the
successes, like those in El Salvador, Cambodia and
Mozambique. To go back a generation, no one should
forget the role that was played by the Security Council
and the Secretary-General in that desperate month of
October 1962 when the hands of the clock were seconds
before midnight and the world did face potential nuclear
holocaust. And no one should forget the role that, for
example, the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty has played
in falsifying the almost universal prediction in the 1960s
that within two decades there would be 20 or more States
possessing nuclear weapons.
In development, in seeking to fulfil its commitment
to promote 'social progress and better standards of life'
the United Nations has laboured hard, sometimes in very
difficult circumstances. The gap between developed and
developing countries remains unacceptably high; there
have been and continue to be difficulties with the
availability of resources for development assistance; and
we have to acknowledge the awful reality, according to
the World Bank, that 1.3 billion of our people still live in
absolute poverty. But in food and agriculture, in
employment and labour standards, in health, in education
and in building the infrastructure so vital to communities
in the developing world — roads, bridges, water
systems — the United Nations and its agencies have
worked relentlessly in the service of the human family. It
is because of the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF) that today 80 per cent of the world’s children
are immunized against six killer diseases. And this is just
10


one of hundreds of similar stories that the United Nations
can and should be telling.
Basic to the United Nations concept of the world
community was that it should operate under and foster the
development of law, justice and human rights. A
fundamental commitment of the United Nations is to
establish conditions under which justice may prevail,
international law will be respected and peace can be built.
In fulfilment of this charge, the United Nations has
provided the setting for the negotiation of over 300 major
treaties, including in such crucial fields as arms control,
transport, navigation and communications. This very
practical area of international cooperation has formed the
framework of a globalized world.
The Charter of the United Nations speaks not just of
securing better standards of life, but of those better
standards being enjoyed “in larger freedom”. And the
articulation, development and implementation of human
rights standards across the whole spectrum of rights —
economic, social and cultural as well as political and
civil — has been one of the most important and
constructive roles of the United Nations. One of the worst
of all denials of personal and political freedom was that
imposed by apartheid. The triumph over that evil was above
all a victory for those South Africans and their leaders
whose freedom and dignity apartheid had so long denied.
But it would ignore the testimony of history not to
recognize the importance of the role played by the General
Assembly and the Security Council in creating the
conditions for that to occur.
For the peoples of this world, no political right has
been more important than the right to self-determination.
The achievements of the United Nations in this field alone
are testimony to the indispensable role it has played in
human affairs, with hundreds of millions of people having
exercised their right to self-determination in these past 50
years. It is the great movement of decolonization, as much
as the cold war and its aftermath, that defines the modern
world as we now know it, and which shapes the world’s
agenda for the years that lie ahead.
The United Nations of the future will need to be,
above all, an organization which works and speaks for all
its Members, no matter how large or small, and whose
legitimacy is thus without question. It must be an
organization better oriented to performance, to delivery to
people of the things they need and have a right to expect.
And it must be an organization which seeks to reintegrate,
and better coordinate, the implementation of the three basic
objectives of the United Nations so clearly articulated at
San Francisco 50 years ago: the objectives of peace —
meeting the need for security; of development —
meeting economic needs; and of human rights and
justice — meeting the need for individual and group
dignity and liberty.
In the peace agenda, disarmament and arms control
continue to be of crucial importance, and a major
challenge immediately ahead will be to maintain the
momentum of multilateral disarmament and
non-proliferation efforts. The decision by the Review and
Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to extend the
Treaty indefinitely was, and remains — despite what has
happened since — the right decision. The work on a
comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty must be brought to
conclusion, as promised, in the first half of 1996. We
must also begin as soon as possible negotiations on a
treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear-
weapons purposes. A further helpful step, although more
difficult to achieve, would be a regime requiring all States
to declare and account for their present stocks of fissile
material. The basic objective in all of this is to move
towards the goal that is agreed by all — and it should
never be forgotten that it has been agreed by all —
namely, that we will, ultimately, eliminate all nuclear
weapons.
It is in this context particularly that the decisions by
France and China to continue nuclear testing are to be so
strongly deplored. The environmental consequences are
bad enough of setting off an explosion more than five
times the size of that which destroyed Hiroshima — as
France did yesterday on the fragile atoll of Fangataufa in
Australia’s Pacific neighbourhood. But the nuclear policy
consequences are even worse. This is not the time to be
reinforcing nuclear stockpiles and asserting their ongoing
deterrent role: the world wants and needs to be moving in
the opposite direction.
This is the time to be negotiating away those
stockpiles, and building verification systems of the kind
we did with the chemical weapons Convention — which
still needs to be ratified to come into effect — and I urge
those States that have not yet acceded to that Convention
to do so urgently. This is not the time to be encouraging
scepticism about the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, as
the Chinese and French tests are doing. It is, rather, the
time for the nuclear Powers to be encouraging the
universal observance of that Treaty in the way that they
best can: by showing that they themselves are absolutely
11


serious about moving to eliminate nuclear weapons from
the face of the globe. The best way for them to do that
right now is for France and China to immediately end their
testing programmes; for all the nuclear-weapon States to
sign the nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties that now exist in
the South Pacific and elsewhere; and for those States to
commit themselves wholeheartedly to negotiating a
genuinely comprehensive, zero-threshold comprehensive
test-ban treaty into place by the middle of next year.
The past few turbulent years of United Nations
experience on the ground in peace-keeping and peace
enforcement has underlined the need for it to improve the
effectiveness of its work in these important fields. Australia
has welcomed the Secretary-General’s further work in this
area in his very lucid January 1995 “Supplement to An
Agenda for Peace'”. In our own contributions to the debate
on these issues, we have argued for the clearest possible
thinking to be given to the achievability of objectives right
across the whole spectrum of responses to security
problems — from peace-building to peace maintenance to
peace restoration to peace enforcement.
We have consistently argued, and I make the point
again very briefly today, that if the United Nations is to be
able to meet effectively the security challenges of the
post-cold-war world it must begin to devote more resources
to preventive strategies than to reactive strategies. It just
makes more sense to concentrate on prevention than on
after-the-event peace restoration, both for inter-State
conflict and in the unhappily now far more common case
of intra-State conflict. Violent conflicts are always far more
difficult and costly to resolve than non-violent disputes, and
failed States are extremely difficult to piece back together.
All that said, it has been encouraging to see the
progress made in recent days towards resolving the conflict
in the former Yugoslavia, and in moving the Middle East
peace process a substantial new step forward. The United
Nations should always be prepared to lend its support and
encouragement to preventive diplomacy and to peacemaking
efforts taking place outside the formal framework of the
United Nations system, and it should remain particularly
alert to the opportunities envisaged in the Charter for
advancing the peace agenda through regional organizations.
In the latter context we in the Asia-Pacific have been very
pleased with the rapid evolution of the new Regional Forum
of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
over the last two years as a new vehicle for dialogue and
trust and confidence-building, in our own region.
Particular attention has been given recently, as we all
know, to the question of improving the rapid reaction
capability of the United Nations, and I warmly commend
the work that has been done to clarify our thinking on
these issues by the Netherlands and Danish Governments,
and particularly in the major Canadian report, “Towards
a Rapid Reaction Capability for the United Nations”, just
presented to the Assembly. The very useful emphasis of
the Canadian study is on the idea of improving the United
Nations system’s capability at the centre first, particularly
in the area of operational planning, and thereby
encouraging greater willingness by troop contributors to
give practical and more urgent effect to stand-by
arrangements. No organizational arrangements will ever
substitute for clear-eyed decision-making by the Security
Council on the responses and mandates that are
appropriate to particular situations, but the implementation
of changes of this kind should make us much better
equipped as an international community to deal in future
with situations like that in Rwanda, where last time our
response was so tragically inadequate.
The security agenda tends to dominate most popular
perceptions of the United Nations role, but we in the
international community must never allow our attention to
be diverted from the demands of the development agenda,
now as pressing as ever. When historians hundreds of
years hence look back at this last half century, the cold
war and its aftermath will not be the only great
international current to be remembered; it will be the
giant step of decolonization that looms at least as large.
Decolonization led to the emergence of a world
economy which for many years has been seen as divided
principally into two categories, the developed and the
developing countries. But today, the picture is more
complicated. Mainly for reasons of change in technology
and information systems, we do now live in a global
economy. No part of it is entirely separate from the
whole, and no one can act in that global economy in an
effective way, entirely alone. Because we live in that kind
of economy a key part of our action to deal with the
problems of development must, accordingly, be
multilateral, and the key problem facing us, both
multilaterally and in our bilateral, donor roles, is that
within the global economy the gap between rich and poor
countries, despite all efforts to resist this, has grown. The
fact that some 1.3 billion of the 5.7 billion people alive
today live at an unacceptable level of poverty is morally
insupportable, and dangerous.
12


The United Nations of the future must, as a matter of
the most urgent priority, forge a new agenda for
development and reshape its relevant institutions to
implement that agenda effectively. This is as important as
any task it faces in the service of the human family and in
recreating itself as an institution fit for the twenty-first
century. The agenda is available for all to see. It has been
fully described in the six global conferences held by the
United Nations in the past four years — the conferences on
children, the environment, human rights, population, social
development, and now women. There have also been
important studies by the international financial institutions
and by academic institutions. We know now what we need
to do. We must resolve, politically, to do it.
In pursuing these various themes it is important,
however, for us not to lose sight of those geographical
regions where particular focus is still required, and where
the United Nations role is more vital than ever. Africa’s
influence and importance continues to be felt throughout the
world in every field of human activity and culture. Exciting
political developments, including the ending of apartheid,
have been accompanied by major new efforts to restructure
and reform national economies. Those efforts demand the
continued support of the international community, and in
particular the United Nations system. Other regions where
the United Nations needs to play a particular role to
facilitate economic and social development are the Central
Asian republics, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and in a
number of areas in the Indian Ocean region.
The Indian Ocean region is one where Australia, as an
Indian Ocean country as well as an Asia-Pacific country,
has been promoting, with others in the region, both
governmental and non-governmental efforts to enhance
regional cooperation, particularly on economic and trade
issues. The success to date of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (APECC) in developing cooperative
strategies in the Asia-Pacific region to promote prosperity
and stability, complementing the United Nations broader
work for these goals at the international level, does offer
one possible model for the countries of the Indian Ocean
Rim to consider.
The institutions of the United Nations relevant to
economic and social development are urgently in need of
reform. The General Assembly has created the high-level
Working Group needed for political consensus on this. That
must complete its work in this fiftieth anniversary year, and
it must do so creatively, setting aside past vested interests
in the system. We must implement the development agenda
of the future in a way which ensures a productive and fair
place in the global economy for all States.
The complex and interlinked system of principles,
legal regimes and machinery that the United Nations has
established to promote human rights is one of its major
achievements. It must be built upon and strengthened,
recognizing always that the human rights whose
universality and indivisibility we assert are about
economic and social and cultural rights just as much as
about the civil and political rights on which the developed
countries tend to focus so much attention. Priority must
be given to the major international human rights
instruments and machinery and the committees which
monitor their implementation. By this means we can
provide a frank, non-confrontational and constructive
dialogue amongst States parties.
The advisory services and technical-assistance
activities of the United Nations can also play a role in
promoting the observance of human rights and the
implementation of democratic principles around the world.
Programmes to help countries develop their own national
institutions and systems to promote and protect human
rights will enhance their capacity to prevent violations
and, accordingly, make a direct contribution to human
security.
It cannot be sufficiently emphasized enough that the
peace and development and human-rights agendas I have
mentioned are all interlinked. We need to avoid the
compartmentalization that occurred throughout the cold-
war years, in which peace-and-security issues,
development issues and human-rights and justice issues
were isolated in completely different conceptual and
institutional boxes. Any viable modern concept of
international peace, let alone peace within States, must
recognize that peace and security and development are
indissolubly bound up with each other. There can be no
sustainable peace without development and no
development without peace. And human rights, in the
fullest sense, as I have described them, have to come into
the equation too. There is unlikely to be sustainable peace
in any society if material needs are satisfied but needs for
dignity and liberty are not.
No agendas of substance, no matter how clear in
concept, how well-coordinated in principle they may be,
will mean anything to people if they are not able to be
implemented through effective organizational structures
and instruments. There has been widespread recognition
in recent years, as we all know, that the structure of the
13


United Nations that grew up during the past 50 years is
simply not adequate to the tasks of the next.
We now have an embarrassment of riches with respect
to ideas and proposals for change to the United Nations.
Just as it is urgent that we complete work on “An Agenda
for Development” in this fiftieth year, it is equally urgent
that we complete the work of the high-level Working Group
on the reform of the United Nations system also within this
fiftieth year.
The structural problem that it is probably the most
urgently necessary to resolve, if the credibility of the whole
United Nations system is to be maintained, is that of the
Security Council. The debate on this subject has been long
and detailed and is familiar to all of us. Australia’s definite
view is that it has been going on for long enough, and we
are now at the time when action is required. Last year, we
submitted some illustrative models on the basis of which
consideration could be given to an expansion in the
membership of the Council. Others have made very specific
proposals. Again, in this field there is no lack of ideas.
What we have to do now is move to the stage of forging
political consensus on a new Security Council, which will
be effective, represent the whole membership of the United
Nations and sensibly reflect the realities of today and the
future, not those of 1945.
There are many structural changes and personnel
reforms that could and should be made within the United
Nations system to improve its efficiency. But ultimately the
quality of that system depends on what we are prepared to
pay for it.
It is important to appreciate at the outset the order of
magnitude of the sums we are talking about. The core
functions of the United Nations, involving the Headquarters
in New York, the Offices in Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi,
and the five regional Commissions, cost just US$ 1.2
billion between them. To take just one comparison, last
year the annual budget of just one Department in one
United States city, the New York Police Department,
exceeded that $1.2 billion by $600 million.
The total number of personnel needed to run those
United Nations core functions is around 10,700. Compare
the local administration of my own national capital,
Canberra — again, just one city in one of the 185 States
Members of the United Nations — which has some 22,000
employees on the public payroll.
The cost of United Nations peace operations last
year, in Cyprus, Western Sahara, the former Yugoslavia
and 13 other locations, was $3.2 billion. That is less than
what it takes to run just three New York City
Departments: the Police Department, the Fire Department
and the Department of Correction.
If we add to the core functions of the United Nations
all the related programmes and organs, including the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) and the International Drug
Control Programme (UNDCP), we are still talking about
a total of around 33,000 people and a total budget,
including both assessed and voluntary contributions, of
$6.3 billion. That sounds a lot — rather more than just
for the core functions — but it is not quite so much when
one considers, for example, that the annual global
turnover of just one international accounting firm, Price
Waterhouse, is around $4.5 billion.
If we go further than that and add to the core
functions and related programmes all the other specialized
programmes and agencies of the entire United Nations
family — agencies such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), the International Labour
Organization (ILO), the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the International
Atomic Energy Agency, and put into the equation as well
the Bretton Woods institutions — the World Bank group
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which
between them employ nearly 10,000 people and spend $5
billion annually — we are still talking about total United
Nations-system personnel of just around 61,400 and a
total United Nations-system dollar cost of $18.2 billion.
A total of 61,400 may sound like a lot of people,
and it is, but perhaps it is not so many when we consider
that more than this number — 65,000, in fact — are
employed by the three Disney theme parks in California,
Florida and France. Three times as many people sell
McDonald’s hamburgers around the world as work for the
United Nations system. And $18.2 billion might be a lot
of money, but just one major multinational corporation,
Dow Chemical, which happens also to have 61,000
employees world wide, has an annual revenue in excess
of $20 billion.
14


When we put the financial problems of the United
Nations into this kind of perspective, as I think we ought to
do more often, the solutions do not really look quite so
hard. Surely, between us, with our combined defence
expenditure alone of around $767 billion, the 185 Member
States can find that kind of money. But, of course, the
problem of paying for the United Nations has now become
critical because of the unwillingness or inability of so many
of the Member States, including the biggest of us all, to
pay their assessed contributions, notwithstanding that the
cost of these for the major developed-country contributors
works out at between $7 and $15 per head per year — the
price of no more than one or two movie tickets in this city.
We have a short-term problem, which I believe can
and should be solved within the United Nations system by
allowing the United Nations to borrow from the World
Bank. But we also have a longer-term problem which,
frankly, does not look as though it is going to be solved,
however much we continue to work at adjusting assessment
scales, exhort Member States to pay up and remind them of
the consequences under Article 19 of the Charter if they
fail to do so.
So what are we to do about all this? In my judgement,
it is time to look again — this time very seriously
indeed — at the options which exist for supplementing
Member States’ contributions with external sources of
finance. The practicability of collecting a levy on every one
of the $300,000 billion worth of foreign-exchange
transactions that now occur every year remains to be fully
assessed, but simple arithmetic tells us that if we strike a
rate of just .001 per cent for such a levy, which hardly
seems likely to have any significant economic
consequences, we could generate $3 billion in revenue.
Moreover, we know that if we could impose a levy on
international airline passengers of $10 for every
international sector flown, which would be very easily
collectible indeed, we could also raise $3 billion: nearly the
whole annual cost of United Nations peace operations.
There are also other revenue options that, to a greater
or lesser extent, have the same rational nexus with United
Nations costs as these do, in that they involve transactions
which are international, take place within a framework of
law and cooperation provided by the United Nations and
can be harmed by a breakdown in international peace and
security — precisely the areas in which the United Nations
has a fundamental responsibility.
But traditionally, a threshold objection of principle has
been mounted against any such talk. Member States, it has
been said, should themselves wholly own the United
Nations system; if the Secretariat had direct access to
revenue other than assessed contributions of Member
States, who knows what adventures it might be inclined
to get up to. But ownership and control are totally
separate issues. The United Nations operates on a
sovereign-equality principle, which means that, for
example, those six States which between them pay at
present over 65 per cent of the United Nations regular
budget should under no circumstances have greater
authority over how it is spent than the overwhelming
majority of Members, each of which pays much lesser
proportions of the total.
Whatever the funding sources involved, the crucial
question is surely how and by whom the money is spent.
It is absolutely crucial that there be appropriate control of
funds by Member States, with all the accountability
mechanisms that implies. But that does not mean that
those Member States should themselves have to provide
all the funds in the first place.
In talking about these issues to many of my
ministerial colleagues from a wide range of countries and
across all continents over the last few days, I have found
the almost unanimous reaction that the present, and likely
continuing, financial crisis of the United Nations demands
that these issues be looked at again, without any
prejudgements of the questions of principle or
practicability involved.
I would suggest accordingly that the time is right for
the Secretary-General to convene once again a high-level
advisory group, like the Volcker-Ogata group established
in 1992, with a mandate to think explicitly through what
has hitherto been more or less unthinkable: how to fund
the United Nations system in a way that reaches out
beyond the resources that Member States are prepared to
put directly into it. Such a group could report to or work
with a committee of representatives of Member States —
one in existence already, such as the High-Level Working
Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations or
one newly created for the purpose.
A great deal of work has already been or is being
done on many of these issues, and it should be possible
for such a group to report within six months or so —
certainly within a year. The parameters of the debate have
to be changed, and for that to happen we need an
authoritative new statement of the art of the possible.
Here, as elsewhere, we have to move forward. We
have to look to new ideas. We have to encourage
15


humankind’s ingenuity to search for better ways for States
to deal with each other as relationships take new shape, as
new States emerge and as problems which could not have
been conceived of a few years ago become the challenges
of the day.
We will fail to meet those challenges if we adhere
solely to the ideas and dogma of the past. The United
Nations was itself founded on a mixture of idealism and
pragmatism. Both were essential to build a new world 50
years ago, and in the past 50 years that idealism has not
disappeared. It was an important force in bringing about the
end of the cold war, and, more than anything else, it was
idealism that lay behind the process of decolonization,
which so shifted the tectonic plates of history.
To some idealism will always be the enemy of
practicality. But to others it will always involve, more than
anything else, the courage to take advantage of new
opportunities, ensuring that at least some of today’s ideals
will become tomorrow’s reality. Perhaps now, 50 years
beyond San Francisco, we need to renew that idealism and
walk down some of those uncharted paths that idealists
have always been prepared to tread.
"
2713,50,1995,NZL,"May I first take this
occasion to congratulate Ambassador Diogo Freitas do
Amaral of Portugal on his election to the presidency of
the Assembly in this important fiftieth anniversary year.
I should also like to offer a special welcome to
Palau as the one hundred eighty-fifth Member. Palau’s
accession does signal honour to us as a fellow Pacific
State.
Here today I want to talk about making our global
neighbourhood a safer place for all of us; the progress
that has been made in the years since the end of the cold
war, and what still needs to be done. Memories are short;
it is hard to recall the degree of mutual suspicion that
coloured global politics just a few years ago.
We have made great strides in recent times. The
world community has achieved much in its efforts to
make the world safer, and more stable. But we need to
move on to reinforce our achievements in controlling,
reducing and abolishing the horrific weapons of mass
destruction. We have yet to see the dividend we all
expected to flow from the end of the cold war.
The transition to a post-cold-war world is not easy.
We are painfully aware of that. In recent years though,
we have been encouraged to believe that a new world
order was achievable. One of the reasons for this hope,
this optimism, was that the nuclear scourge had receded.
For the first time in 50 years nuclear Powers were
committed to build down rather than to build up, to
decommission and destroy rather than to commission and
construct.
However, recent events have cast a cloud over that
brief period of optimism. New Zealand does not believe
18


that continued nuclear testing, wherever it takes place,
contributes to a safer world. On the contrary, nuclear
testing sends the wrong message to States which do possess
or which aspire to the possession of nuclear weapons. It
also tells them that the development of these weapons is
still acceptable.
The nuclear tests which have taken place since the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was
extended have disturbed the delicate balance achieved at
that Conference. New Zealand believed then, and continues
to believe, that indefinite extension was the right option.
The world needs a strong non-proliferation regime, one that
cannot be called into question by changing global
circumstances. But the Conference went further than that,
the vast majority of participants making it very clear that
they were against nuclear testing. They also wanted to
move towards the nuclear-free world envisaged in article VI
of the Treaty. The cavalier disregard, and dismissal of the
views of the many, has led to considerable disillusionment.
It will take a long time to restore the trust that had been
there.
New Zealand and the rest of the South Pacific region
have long stood tall and proud in opposition to nuclear
weapons and their testing. We abhor testing wherever it
occurs. But the decision to resume testing in what we see
as our home region has particularly angered the people of
New Zealand. The leaders of the South Pacific Forum
nations expressed their outrage at their meeting just two
weeks ago. They were able to recall the painful memories
in the region, going back to atmospheric testing conducted
between 25 and 50 years ago.
The South Pacific has not been alone in its opposition
to nuclear testing. Governments, parliamentarians and
peoples from every region of the world have spoken up in
anger, alarm and dismay. The two Governments which are
continuing to test nuclear weapons must heed the voice of
the international community. They are dancing to a tune no
one wants to hear.
In these circumstances, New Zealand, along with a
representative group of like-minded States, will submit an
appropriate draft resolution to the First Committee of this
Assembly.
Testing is a backward step, and I condemn it. It is not
too late. All that China and France need to do is listen to
international opinion and announce that their testing
programmes have ceased.
I want to welcome the commitment by three of the
nuclear-weapon States — France, the United Kingdom
and the United States — to a genuine ban on nuclear
testing: a prohibition on any nuclear explosions, no matter
how small. This is what we have always called for: a
comprehensive ban — where the word “comprehensive”
means just that. We are pleased that it is attracting serious
support.
New Zealand calls on the two nuclear-weapon States
that have not yet indicated full support for this approach
to do so quickly. Time is short. The deadline for the
negotiations is 1996, and the international community is
holding the Conference on Disarmament accountable for
meeting that deadline and producing a treaty that is
genuinely comprehensive in scope.
In this regard, the General Assembly has become
increasingly concerned about the lack of accountability in
the Conference on Disarmament. Limited and
unrepresentative membership has been a large part of the
problem. Enlargement is long overdue. New Zealand
welcomes the progress made in recent weeks in Geneva,
and we express our gratitude to Morocco for its efforts in
this regard.
However, the real test will be whether by the time
we meet here again next year the new members will have
been able to take their seats. For the moment, the
outcome is still not satisfactory. I recall that democratic
representation was once at the heart of a tea party in
Boston. Let us hope that there will not be a tea party in
New York in 1996 on membership of the Conference on
Disarmament.
I also urge the members of the Conference on
Disarmament to look beyond the conclusion of a
comprehensive test-ban treaty. New Zealand wants to see
an international agreement banning the production of
fissile material for nuclear weapons. That would be
another important step towards negotiations on the total
elimination of nuclear weapons. We urge the Conference
on Disarmament to resolve its procedural differences and
get the negotiations under way.
I should add that at the Review and Extension
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons we raised the idea of
negotiating an agreement to ban the future production of
nuclear weapons. That could take us a step closer to
eliminating the nuclear threat.
19


But it is also important to address the issues relating
to conventional weapons.
I wish, first, to address the issue of land-mines. I want
to congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff for the
way they have picked up this issue and raised public
awareness around the world. The Conference organized in
Geneva this year was most timely — but more is needed.
Both financial and technical resources need to be made
available to help dispose of the millions of treacherous life-
and livelihood-destroying mines that have already been laid.
I pledge New Zealand’s ongoing assistance in this work.
Of course, disposal alone is not the answer. Urgent
progress needs to be made to deal with these hideous
weapons, which go on claiming the lives of innocent
people — farmers, their children, shopkeepers, collectors of
wood, carriers of water — long after conflicts have ceased.
I ask all the participants at the Conference which opened
this week in Vienna, which has as its main aim the revision
of international law on land-mines, to work together to
achieve the tightest possible restrictions on these totally
indiscriminate weapons. I want to work to eliminate them
entirely from the world’s armouries.
This leads one to the broader questions of arms
transfers. We are profoundly disturbed at the unnecessary
and irrational increase in arms transfers. At a time when,
globally, resources are desperately needed for development,
for the environment, for health, why is it that even modest
measures, such as enhancing the United Nations Register of
Conventional Arms are still being resisted?
Neither peace nor development is advanced if States
put increasingly scarce economic resources into the defence
sectors of their economies. Far too much of the global
economic capacity is going into armaments when the
citizens of the world desperately need better health, better
education and a better future for their children.
The widespread availability of conventional arms and
the resurgence of ethnic nationalism have, together,
produced a very dangerous cocktail, which poses a major
threat to stability in the post-cold-war era. The need for
Member States to maintain a collective approach in
addressing these challenges has never been greater.
Events in the former Yugoslavia over the past year
have presented an enormous challenge to the international
community. New Zealand fully supported the firm response
made by this Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to the murderous shelling of Sarajevo late in
August. The diplomatic efforts now under way, including
the very important constitutional agreement reached last
Tuesday, offer some prospect for bringing to an end
almost four years of a most appalling conflict.
Some have been dismissive of the achievements of
the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia. That,
however, is to overlook the saving of tens of thousands of
lives and the substantial relief of suffering. This is why
New Zealand, despite its geographical distance from the
region, has been willing to play its part. I believe that,
one day, the United Nations mission in Bosnia will enjoy
recognition of the successes it has achieved so far.
It is a little too easy to focus on the problems of the
United Nations. We need to remember its successes as
well. I think of Cambodia and Mozambique, of El
Salvador and Haiti, of Namibia and Angola and of the
contributions to peace in various parts of the Middle East
over the years. Even in Somalia, where a political
settlement proved elusive, massive famine was relieved
thanks to the United Nations.
The United Nations is unique. It is called on to deal
with the most intractable problems — the ones that others
put into the “too hard” basket. And it works under the
closest public scrutiny of Governments and the world’s
media.
New Zealand strongly supports practical steps to
improve peace-keeping management. We have, in fact,
provided additional specialist personnel to the Department
of Peace-keeping Operations at our own expense. We
have contributed to the strengthening of the Secretariat’s
capacity in the demining area. And we shall continue
these commitments because we believe that they are so
necessary. We also entered into the United Nations
stand-by arrangements earlier this year, and we hope that
these will provide a clearer focus for peace-keeping and
its planning.
We have also studied with interest the Secretary-
General’s recommendation, in his Supplement to “An
Agenda for Peace”, that the United Nations should
consider the idea of a rapid-deployment force. I wish to
commend the ground-breaking work that has already been
done by Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark and others.
My discussions yesterday with Ministers from these and
other countries were encouraging to me. Progress can and
should be made in this area.
20


At about this time last year I spoke to the General
Assembly about a number of elements that I consider
critical to the conduct of peace-keeping operations. These
included a sustainable financial system, transparent political
accountability, clear objectives, a credible legal regime that
guarantees the security of United Nations personnel and, of
course, the availability of resources so that objectives can
be met quickly and efficiently.

Progress has been made. We were especially pleased
to see the Convention on the Safety of United Nations
Personnel opened for signature during last year’s session.
We urge those that have not signed it to do so, and soon.
We owe that to the thousands who have served, and are
serving, in the United Nations operations worldwide.
The improved procedures for consultation between the
Security Council and troop contributors, initiated by
Argentina and New Zealand, have now been in place for
almost a year. Pleasing as this is, we still have some way
to go. It is up to those of us who contribute troops to
United Nations operations to ensure there is no slippage in
these procedures.
Regrettably, however, we do not appear to have a
sustainable financial system. I am gravely concerned that,
despite all the warnings here in this Assembly last year,
delegations have not made any real progress in the Working
Group addressing the financial crisis. The United
Nations — this United Nations — ran out of cash in mid-
August. The arrears of Member States in respect of the
regular and peace-keeping budgets have reached
unprecedented levels. It is nothing short of a tragedy that
on the eve of our celebration of the fiftieth anniversary, the
United Nations, this body of ours, is on the verge of
bankruptcy.
At this critical point in the United Nations history, we
need political will, not more words. “Words pay no debts”,
as Shakespeare wrote. We need new ideas, not recycled
platitudes. And, above all, Members must pay their dues,
on time, and in full.
We do stand here at a crossroads. In taking stock of
the United Nations 50 years, we have much on which to
reflect. There have been good times, and there have been
bad times. Reform and revitalization must stay on our
minds. I wish to assure you, Sir, and all other members, of
New Zealand’s commitment to help remould the
Organization to that which will be needed to work for all
of us as we head towards the twenty-first century.
"
2728,64,2009,VUT,"I begin by joining others 
in congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on 
assuming the noble and high responsibility of the 
presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth 
session. Let me wish him well in his leadership as the 
United Nations makes its way through the myriad 
evolving challenges on the global agenda. I also take 
this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for 
his vision and for the initiatives that he has resolutely 
pursued in the interests of all humanity. 
 The theme of the sixty-fourth General Assembly 
session will serve to focus the attention of the 
international community on the critical importance of 
building partnerships for more equitable and 
sustainable development. My delegation shares the 
belief that sustainable development is the responsibility 
of everyone, and that its realization requires strong 
partnerships at all levels. I firmly believe that equity 
and sustainable development are mutually reinforcing 
goals, for it would be difficult to support peace, 
security and growth in any process of development that 
left much of humanity behind.  
 One of the major goals of my country’s 
comprehensive reform programme, introduced during 
the mid-1990s, is to promote social equity, especially 
in terms of integrating the needs of our culturally 
diverse people and geographically remote communities 
into our national development priorities. I am glad to 
say that we are still pursuing our nationwide policy 
consultation processes, aimed at developing and 
maintaining sound policies and frameworks for 
delivering services to our people at the grass-roots 
level. 
 We in the Pacific are grateful to all our 
development partners for their continuing support and 
their commitment to working closely with us in 
developing mechanisms for strengthening development 
coordination, improving development outcomes, using 
available resources effectively and ensuring 
inclusiveness in our approach to development. 
 We are very much aware of the fact that despite 
continued high levels of development assistance over 
many years, the economic and development 
performance of island States in the Pacific region 
remains weak. Many countries in our region, including 
Vanuatu, are not on track to achieve all the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Vanuatu will 
therefore remain firmly committed to the principles of 
the Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development 
Coordination in the Pacific. We are committed to 
working closely with the Pacific Islands Forum 
Secretariat and other multilateral agencies to ensure 
that all resources made available to the region are 
focused on the aim of achieving real progress towards 
the MDGs. We are also committed to work with our 
individual donor partners to ensure that they support 
our national development priorities that are linked to 
our overall efforts to achieve the MDGs. 
 However, Vanuatu is aware that commitments to 
strengthening development coordination in the Pacific 
region are being made against the backdrop of the 
global economic crisis. My delegation therefore wishes 
to renew our call to international financial institutions 
to assist Pacific island countries in responding to the 
international economic crisis. Vanuatu is very 
concerned that its recent high economic growth 
performance, which rose above 6 per cent between 
2006 and 2007, will fall sharply as a result of the 
global economic recession. International Monetary 
Fund and Asian Development Bank growth estimates 
forecast that Vanuatu’s economy will grow at a slower 
 
 
41 09-52470 
 
pace in 2008 and 2009, averaging between 3 and 4 per 
cent. Growth prospects for the future continue to be 
uncertain. Maintaining strong economic growth over 
the next few years will be critical if Vanuatu is to 
succeed in sustained delivery of such basic services as 
education, health and infrastructure development to its 
80 scattered islands. 
 In the light of these concerns Vanuatu is pleased 
that in February 2010 it will be hosting a Pacific-
United Nations Conference on The Human Face of the 
Global Economic Crisis in the Pacific. Discussions of 
the organizational arrangements for this important 
event are under way between my Government, United 
Nations specialized agencies actively engaged in the 
Pacific region and Pacific regional organizations. We 
all look forward to the outcome of the conference, 
especially in terms of guidance and support for 
building Pacific regional partnerships that can assist us 
in addressing the impacts of this and future global 
economic crises on the livelihoods of our people. 
 The complex and challenging circumstances in 
Fiji have led to international condemnation and 
pressure for early elections to be held. Further 
international pressure has been brought to bear on the 
Government of Fiji in view of more recent 
developments. While Vanuatu is part of the Pacific-
wide regional calls for an early return of democracy in 
Fiji, my Government believes that continued 
engagement of the Fiji Government by the 
international community will be critical. Under 
Vanuatu’s chairmanship, the Melanesian Spearhead 
Group has continued to maintain high-level dialogue 
with the Government of Fiji, primarily to ascertain that 
Government’s views and to put forward the concerns of 
neighbouring States. 
 Vanuatu welcomes the recent establishment of a 
full-fledged department to oversee the implementation 
of the framework for change that the Fiji Government 
introduced recently and to facilitate a nationwide 
process of reconciliation and dialogue. As the closest 
neighbouring island State, Vanuatu continues to plead 
that the process of returning Fiji to democracy and 
parliamentary legitimacy should be driven by peaceful 
dialogue and genuine concern for the socio-economic 
well-being of the people of Fiji. Any punitive measures 
would not be in the economic and social interest of the 
good people of Fiji or the region of the Pacific as a 
whole. We are all too aware of the unprecedented 
challenges that small island developing States like 
Vanuatu have come to be faced with today. Man-made 
or linked with such phenomena as climate change, 
these challenges pose unacceptable implications for the 
social, economic and political structures of our small 
island States and often have grave security 
implications. 
 Vanuatu would like at this juncture cordially to 
applaud the tireless and collective efforts of all the 
island nations, large and small, in cooperating and 
working together towards the adoption by the General 
Assembly this past June of resolution 63/281 on 
climate change and its possible security implications. 
This is indeed a historical milestone for Pacific small 
island developing States, such as my own country, 
because for the first time the security implications of 
climate change were brought to the attention of the 
international community. Over the years differing and 
conflicting views have stalled the strenuous efforts of 
the small island countries in convincing the world that 
the impact of climate change was irreversible. Inherent 
in many of the arguments that needed to be overcome 
was the idea that there was still time. 
 At this point I wish to reiterate that the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
must be the principal forum for addressing climate 
change. Given our vulnerabilities and geographic 
realities, we in the Pacific region have been among the 
first fully to accept the security implications of climate 
change. I would like to stress here that no country, 
small or large, developed or developing, will be able to 
avoid the security implications of climate change, 
which are already affecting the livelihoods of our 
people, as the international community struggles to 
come to terms with the idea that climate change poses 
a real threat to the future survival of mankind. Unless 
all the relevant organs of the United Nations intensify 
their efforts to consider and address the issue of 
climate change, no word will be more appropriate to 
the global situation under this particular crisis than the 
word “doomed”. The momentum seen today forces 
upon us the realization that these threats are real and 
therefore require urgent attention. 
 In preparations for the coming conference in 
Copenhagen, leaders of the Alliance of Small Island 
States have agreed this week that more action is 
required from members of the international community 
in living up to their commitments. While globalization 
and interdependency have brought with them both 
opportunities and challenges for the small island

States, the challenges predominate and are ominous. 
The gathering of world leaders at the Summit on 
Climate Change at this year’s General Assembly was a 
reaffirmation that climate change presents a security 
threat to all our nations and peoples. 
 Consisting of volcanic and coral islands, Vanuatu 
is one of the smaller island nations in the South Pacific 
region and in the world. Because of Vanuatu’s rapidly 
growing young population and low economic growth 
rate, the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) assessment, until very recently, ranked it as 
one of the poorest countries in the South Pacific 
region. This degree of underdevelopment drastically 
limits its capacity to effectively curb threats associated 
with the adverse impacts of climate change. 
 More than 80 per cent of the people of Vanuatu 
live off the land through subsistence farming, which 
constitutes their contribution to the national economy. 
Vanuatuan traditional farming practices have been 
shaped by farmers’ subsistence needs and climatic 
conditions. Land has always been precious to the 
Ni-Vanuatu; rights to its ownership and use form a 
central part of their culture and traditional governance. 
The rapidly growing population of Vanuatu places 
increasing pressure on access to a finite amount of 
farmland. This issue is likely to be compounded by 
probable losses of arable land owing to the adverse 
effects of climate change. Such possible losses raise 
serious economic, political and security implications 
for Vanuatu. 
 Not only is Vanuatu among the least developed 
countries, but it remains one of the most disaster-prone 
nations among the small island States. It is highly 
susceptible to cyclones, coastal erosion, river flooding, 
earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis and volcanic 
eruptions. 
 Without doubt these are challenging times. We 
followed with great interest the recent Conference on 
the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its 
Impact on Development. Vanuatu is deeply concerned 
that the world financial crisis, like climate change, is 
caused by external forces beyond our control, and yet 
its rippling effects are quickly reaching our nation’s 
most vulnerable populations. Children, women, the 
disabled and the working poor will be the hardest hit 
and the least able to cope with dramatic changes. 
 Vanuatu is indeed being hurt by a variety of 
economic realities, such as decreasing trade, erratic 
commodity prices, increased borrowing costs and 
strains on official development assistance. One of the 
reasons for this downturn is that we are quite 
dependent on external financing, in the form of both 
aid and trade. Furthermore our foreign-exchange 
earnings and our Government revenue rely on a small 
number of commodities. However, we are confident 
that we will be able to counteract those weaknesses in 
our economic situation by introducing progressive 
microeconomic policy mechanisms, improving 
Government structures and striving to maintain 
political stability. This plan is in line with working to 
implement the Millennium Development Goals and to 
achieve country targets by the year 2015. 
 Vanuatu emphatically concurs with the premise of 
the upcoming Copenhagen conference that climate 
change is one of the most fundamental challenges ever 
to confront humanity. No issue is more fundamental to 
long-term global prosperity, and no issue is more 
essential to our survival as a species. I strongly feel 
that a fair and comprehensive global deal in 
Copenhagen will represent a step forward for all us, for 
nations small or large, developing or developed. 
Mutual cooperation, respect and trust will be the key 
political driving forces for a successful deal in 
Copenhagen. 
 While we commend recent efforts to reform the 
United Nations, Vanuatu shares the view of many other 
countries that to ensure a stronger and more effective 
Organization we need to reconsider the membership of 
the Security Council sooner rather than later. If the 
Council’s membership better reflected the world’s 
geography and better represented currently 
underrepresented groups, the United Nations would 
build a stronger sense of common responsibility and 
collective responsiveness. A more representative 
Council would bring openness and transparency, create 
confidence and ameliorate understanding and 
cooperation. 
 Still, any reform must be implemented in a way 
that does not affect the authority of the Council. Of 
course there are diverse vested interests among us. But 
our common interests and the United Nations role in 
furthering them must continue to hold a central place to 
ensure the continuity of the international legal 
framework. Negotiations must therefore be conducted 
in an atmosphere of inclusion and through constructive 
dialogue and positive engagement. Diatribes offer no 
solutions. We must remain resolute in our defence of 
 
 
43 09-52470 
 
the United Nations; the necessity of this Organization 
is continuously made clear by the horrors that the 
scourges of armed conflict, disease and famine inflict 
on people, especially women and children. 
 On a more administrative level, the highly 
bureaucratic procedures and accession mechanisms 
established by the United Nations system for much 
needed funds have placed unnecessary strain on local 
capacities. As the burgeoning climate crisis looms on 
the horizon we need to identify ways of simplifying 
procedures, such as those for accessing climate change 
mitigation funds, and to consider revising delivery 
modalities, including exploring direct access 
possibilities. The blueprint for international 
cooperation may be in place but it must be followed up 
by action. 
 Finally, my delegation welcomes Security 
Council resolution 1887 (2009) on non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons and disarmament. The presence of all 
the leaders of the Permanent Five at the meeting (see 
S/PV.6191) demonstrates a commitment to control the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Maintaining 
international peace and security will always remain 
humanity’s greatest challenge, and there is hope. 
 Despite all our differences and diversities, human 
security for all is our main objective. We recognize the 
efforts of the Secretary-General and commend the 
manner in which he has pursued the mobilization of 
political momentum for Copenhagen with the relevant 
bodies of the United Nations. Saving the Earth and 
humanity remains our ultimate goal. 
 In conclusion, we go to Copenhagen with 
optimism. The future is in our hands. Let us not 
deprive future generations of their right to live in a 
world of peace and stability."
2791,64,2009,NRU,"I would like to offer my 
congratulations, Mr. President, on your assumption of 
the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-
fourth session. Allow me also to commend your 
predecessor, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for 
his capable leadership during the sixty-third session. I 
assure you, Sir, of my delegation’s full support and 
cooperation as you lead the work of this important 
session. 
 The new millennium has been no stranger to 
crisis. We have seen how ideological extremism can 
foment turmoil and civil unrest in ways that do not 
respect international borders. We have also learned that 
financial instability can quickly propagate through 
global markets and cause chaos in the real economy. 
And we have been repeatedly reminded that we 
disrespect the natural environment at our peril. 
 The global challenges that we face today may 
sometimes shock us, but they should not surprise us. 
Most stem from problems that have been allowed to 
fester and grow for many years, if not decades. All are 
inextricably linked to the choices made by the 
international community regarding international 
commerce and development. The challenges of the new 
millennium are global in nature and therefore require a 
global response. Now, more than ever, we must 
revitalize our multilateral systems of governance in 
order to make them more responsive and more 
representative. Large countries tend to dominate 
international forums and drown out the rest of us.  
 In the case of climate change and small island 
States, I mean that quite literally. We must consider the 
impacts of our activities and institutions on the most 
vulnerable, so that large and small countries alike can 
enjoy the stability and security necessary for 
sustainable economic development. In this new 
millennium, even the mighty have been humbled. So 
what does that mean for a small island nation like 
Nauru? When giants stumble, it is usually the smallest 
that suffer the most serious injuries. 
 The international community must begin this 
process of renewal by reaffirming its commitment to 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an 
initiative meant to alleviate the burdens of extreme 
poverty, hunger, illiteracy, inequality and disease. After 
early success in the 1990s, progress towards the MDGs 
has slowed throughout the world.  
 In the Pacific, where nearly 40 per cent of the 
population lives on less than a dollar a day, it has been 
no different. The reasons are not hard to identify. The 
Asian financial crisis was devastating for the 
economies in our region. The recent spike in food and 
energy prices has strained our limited financial 
resources. Now the global economic downturn 
threatens to depress our economies even further. 
 Additionally, the Pacific confronts a unique set of 
challenges in reaching our MDGs. Our remoteness 
makes it difficult to access world markets and greatly 
increases the cost of doing business. Our small size 
deprives us of the advantage of economies of scale, and 
our vulnerability to climate change places our hard-
won economic and social progress in jeopardy. Perhaps 
the most vivid example of our situation is the price of a 
bag of rice. For most countries, the food crisis has 
eased as commodity prices have fallen but, in Nauru, 
the price of a bag of rice has increased by 80 per cent 
over the past year, hovering now above $60. The rest of 
the world pays less than $25. 
 The time has come for the international 
community to deliver on its promises and to dedicate 
0.7 per cent of gross national income to helping 
developing countries meet their development goals. 
Past recessions have led to a steep drop in levels of 
official development assistance. There will be no hope 
of reaching our MDGs if that happens again. 
 It is vitally important for United Nations agencies 
to strengthen their engagement in the Pacific region. 
For the past four years, Nauru has called upon the 
United Nations to establish a presence on the ground 
by opening an office in our country. It is my fervent 
hope that the next time that I address this body I can 
announce that that commitment of the United Nations 
has been fulfilled. 
 The absence of the United Nations in the Pacific 
is reflected by the paucity of statistics collected in the 
region. Accurate indicators are necessary for tracking 
economic and social progress. It is critical for United 
Nations agencies and other international institutions to 
work more closely with our national Governments and 
with regional organizations so that accurate data is 
available for planning and policymaking. 
 The temptation to add layer upon layer of new 
programmes must be avoided. We must not forget the 
commitments made under the Mauritius Strategy for 
the Further Implementation of the Programme of 
 
 
5 09-52463 
 
Action for the Sustainable Development of Small 
Island Developing States, the Monterrey Consensus, 
the Paris Declaration and other international 
agreements. Too often, the United Nations and other 
development partners succeed in delivering many new 
reports, but fail to deliver tangible results. Action plans 
are no substitute for action. We must dispense with the 
excuse that helping poor countries develop is 
something that we cannot afford. That is simply not 
true. Quite the opposite: in a globalized world, leaving 
large portions of the world to languish in poverty is 
what we cannot afford. 
 The international community must also reform 
the world financial system so that all developing 
countries share equitably in global economic 
prosperity. The current economic crisis has revealed 
deep flaws in our international financial system. The 
overriding goals of those reforms should be to facilitate 
growth in developing nations and to increase their 
resilience to abrupt economic fluctuations and the 
fickle flow of capital. 
 While Nauru does not have a mature financial 
sector, shocks to the international system can be 
devastating to our local economy and dry up vital 
development assistance. To be effective, development 
assistance needs to be reliable. That is not possible 
without a stable and transparent financial system. 
 Lastly, the international community must next 
take swift steps to mitigate climate change, starting 
with a bold agreement in Copenhagen. Climate change 
presents the greatest threat for my country and many 
other small island developing States. Scientists warn 
that, within our children’s lifetime, sea levels may rise 
by a metre or more. That would wipe out low-lying 
coastal areas, and many Pacific islands would be a 
distant memory. 
 However, we do not need to wait for that 
catastrophic scenario to see the impacts of climate 
change. We live with them every day. Flooding and 
inundation are already eroding our shores and 
contaminating our water supply. Higher water 
temperatures and ocean acidification are damaging the 
marine ecosystems that we depend on for food and our 
economic livelihood. We pray that malaria does not 
find its way to our doorstep. 
 I applaud the commitment of the Secretary-
General to addressing that issue and his efforts to build 
consensus among world leaders this week at the high-
level Summit on Climate Change. From Asia to Africa 
and the Arctic, he has visited affected regions to 
observe the effects of climate change first hand, but not 
the Pacific, one of the most vulnerable regions in the 
world.  
 When the Secretary-General glances out the 
window of his aircraft while travelling between Asia 
and the Americas, I would ask that he remember that, 
in the vast expanse of water below, there is a whole 
region of people living on small islands who are 
already grappling with the consequences of climate 
change. I encourage that his next trip be to the nations 
of the Pacific before they disappear. 
 The science tells us that we must reduce the 
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to 
350 parts per million or less in order to avoid the most 
dire climate change scenarios. However, most 
developed countries have proposed emissions targets 
that would result in concentrations far higher. 
 That is not acceptable policy when human lives 
are at stake. If a doctor prescribes medicine to treat a 
serious illness, do we only give the patient half of what 
is needed? If an engineer says eight columns are 
necessary to support a building, would any responsible 
person recommend that we use only four? Then why 
are the most vulnerable countries asked to accept 
proposals that would surely lead to our extinction? 
That is not good enough when the lives of real people 
from real places are being threatened. 
 Developed countries must also provide the 
financial, technical and human resources necessary for 
us to address a problem that was not of our own 
making. Nauru joins the Alliance of Small Island States 
in calling for developed countries to provide the 
equivalent of 1 per cent of their gross domestic product 
for urgent adaptation and mitigation efforts in 
developing countries. That must be in addition to their 
current commitments for development assistance. 
 Climate change calls for the widest possible 
cooperation from every member of the international 
community. Taiwan, as one of the world’s 20 largest 
economies, can contribute in many ways and should be 
invited to play a larger role in the United Nations 
system, particularly in the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change process. Taiwan has 
much to offer to vulnerable countries, especially in 
adaptation measures, technology transfer and 
financing. 
  
 
09-52463 6 
 
 Climate change is an imminent threat to 
international security. It is therefore vital that the 
Security Council be seized of the issue and closely 
monitor new developments. Special attention must be 
paid to the most vulnerable countries, including the 
small island developing States and least developed 
countries, and also to vulnerable groups within 
countries, including women and children, indigenous 
people and the poor. 
 The challenges of the new millennium can be 
overcome only through multilateral cooperation and a 
revitalized United Nations system. It is necessary for 
the Security Council to be more representative in both 
the permanent and non-permanent categories to reflect 
current geopolitical realities, which is why Japan, 
India, Germany and Brazil should be made permanent 
members. I also call upon the General Assembly, as the 
world’s most representative governance body, to accept 
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in its specialized 
agencies and other world forums. 
 We have seen the power of multilateral 
cooperation around the world and close to home. My 
country was at the brink of economic collapse at the 
beginning of this decade. In cooperation with Pacific 
Islands Forum member Governments, my country 
outlined a number of key governance and development 
priorities in the Pacific Regional Assistance for Nauru 
(PRAN) programme. It included a re-evaluation of 
fiscal policies and objectives, review of our 
Constitution, and reforms for our education and health 
sectors. I am proud that in just four years we have 
reached the goals laid out in PRAN, so much so that at 
the fortieth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting, 
held in Cairns, Australia just last month, leaders agreed 
that Nauru had emerged from the crisis phase and was 
on the path to sustainable economic recovery and 
development, and that PRAN was no longer required. 
 PRAN was an excellent example of how country-
focused development aid can quickly lift a nation out 
of crisis and back onto the path towards sustainable 
development. PRAN was successful because it 
identified concrete objectives and was backed by 
sufficient funds. Future programmes in the region 
should likewise bring tangible benefits and be free 
from political influence. 
 Here I must acknowledge and express Nauru’s 
deepest appreciation to Australia, New Zealand, 
Taiwan, Japan and Forum island countries, our own 
regional organizations and others for their unwavering 
funding and other forms of support to PRAN. The 
people of Nauru will always remember their generosity 
during our time of need. 
 We are also grateful to the United Nations 
Democracy Fund. With its assistance, Nauru recently 
adopted a number of important constitutional 
amendments that will enhance good governance and 
bring increased stability and responsiveness to my 
Government. 
 One of the founding fathers of the United Nations 
once said, “The test of our progress is not whether we 
add more to the abundance of those who have much; it 
is whether we provide enough for those who have too 
little”. President Roosevelt passed away before the 
inaugural session of the General Assembly, but those of 
us here today have the responsibility to see that his 
spirit lives on. 
 The United Nations system of multilateral 
governance was born out of a time of great crisis and it 
ushered in over half a century of peace and prosperity. 
However, the benefits were not shared equally, and two 
thirds of humanity was largely left behind. The time 
has come to take up the project begun 64 years ago so 
that future prosperity can be shared by all, including 
the smallest and most vulnerable. The United Nations 
continues to be our best hope for creating a fairer and 
more just world. 
 God bless the Republic of Nauru, and God bless 
the United Nations."
2821,64,2009,NZL,"To the powers, to the 
voices, to the four winds: I greet you all.
 I have addressed the Assembly in Te Reo Maori, 
the indigenous language of New Zealand, and I bring 
warm Pacific greetings from all New Zealanders. 
 I am deeply honoured to lead New Zealand’s 
delegation to the General Assembly for the first time. 
Like every New Zealand Prime Minister since 1945, I 
stand here today to reaffirm my country’s commitment 
to the United Nations and the United Nations Charter. 
 The founding Members of the United Nations 
gathered in San Francisco in 1945 to create this 
Organization out of the ashes of the most destructive 
war and the most debilitating depression in modern 
history. They believed in the larger freedom of a world 
where collective action might avert common crises. 
They believed in the rule of law, by which all States 
would be held to a universal standard, and in a world 
where all peoples, faiths and cultures could flourish. 
They believed in a future in which every human being 
would be free from want and free from fear. And they 
wanted an international Organization and architecture 
that could deliver those benefits.  
 New Zealand was active among those founding 
Members in San Francisco. And, as a small, 
independent and diverse country in the Pacific, New 
Zealand still has a stake in the United Nations — this 
great meeting place for all States. 
 I have benefited personally from efforts to secure 
those ideals. My family fled persecution in Europe, and 
I was privileged to grow up in a new world where a 
child of immigrants is now accorded the extraordinary 
privilege of leading his country and addressing this 
Assembly on its behalf. 
 We meet at a time of many challenges. With 
130 heads of State and Government assembled here 
this week, the present session of the General Assembly 
represents our greatest opportunity since the 2005 
World Summit to reaffirm our collective resolve. New 
Zealand embraces that opportunity. Today, I will focus 
on some of the most pressing issues demanding 
collective responses from us. 
 The crisis in the global economy continues. We 
must remain resolute in our efforts to stabilize the 
global economy in order to permit a return to 
sustainable growth. New Zealand welcomes the actions 
of the Group of 20 (G-20) over the past year. But, in 
commending those efforts, we call on the G-20 to heed 
 
 
31 09-52470 
 
the voices of the world’s small economies and to 
ensure that they are also heard in global decision-
making. 
 Free and fair trade will be the principal engine for 
driving developing countries out of poverty and 
bringing greater prosperity to all. An essential 
component in our response to the global economic 
crisis must therefore be a balanced and ambitious 
conclusion to the Doha Round of world trade talks. A 
genuinely global agreement that reduces tariffs, 
eliminates export subsidies, reduces domestic subsidies 
and increases market access will see benefits flow to 
all States. At a time when all countries are suffering 
from the brunt of the current economic crisis, further 
delay is inexcusable. 
 As one of the world’s first truly open economies, 
New Zealand has an unwavering commitment to trade 
liberalization and to the pursuit of bilateral, regional 
and global free trade agreements. We support the call 
of the Secretary-General for the immediate suspension 
of price controls and other agricultural trade 
restrictions, in order to reduce soaring food prices and 
help millions cope with the highest food prices in 
30 years. 
 Therefore, I call on all those States and groupings 
that have broken their undertakings and reintroduced 
protectionist measures to reconsider. Those actions are 
as harmful as they are unacceptable. Agriculture, which 
is so important for developing countries in particular, is 
one of the sectors most affected. 
 The escalation of poverty is a result of the 
economic crisis. New Zealand is, naturally, proud of 
the efforts of the United Nations Development 
Programme to strengthen its focus as the largest United 
Nations development agency on poverty and the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  
 For its part, New Zealand pledges to continue to 
increase its official development assistance, with a 
clear focus on the Pacific Islands region. Aid 
effectiveness is just as important as the quantum of aid. 
That is why, last month, we committed to the Cairns 
Compact, which will strengthen development 
coordination in the Pacific islands. 
 The major focus of the General Assembly this 
year must be on the challenge of climate change. 
Climate change demands innovation and a global 
response. The world cannot afford to contemplate 
failure at Copenhagen. Political leadership is needed, 
and it is on display.  
 At the Summit on climate change this week, the 
leaders of the world’s three biggest economies showed 
their determination both to make Copenhagen a success 
and to take action themselves. All countries must take 
action that reflects our individual circumstances, 
responsibilities and capabilities. 
 For our part, New Zealand is committed to 
securing a durable and meaningful agreement on 
climate change — an agreement that is both 
environmentally effective and economically efficient. I 
have set a target for New Zealand of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by 10 to 20 per cent below 
1990 levels by 2020, if there is a comprehensive global 
agreement. That amounts to a per capita drop of 35 to 
42 per cent since 1990. 
 New Zealand is acutely conscious that most of 
our greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock 
methane emissions, which so far no technology can 
reduce. At the same time we are proud of our role as a 
food producer to the world and the contribution we can 
make to assuring food security for the world’s people. 
 Our challenge is to find a way to balance growth 
in agricultural production with the need to reduce 
emissions and reach climate change targets.  
 That is not just a challenge for New Zealand, but 
one for the world. Agricultural emissions make up 
14 per cent of all emissions worldwide. As demand for 
food rises, so will those emissions. Yet so far the only 
known way to achieve emission reductions from 
agriculture is through reductions in output, which is 
not an acceptable response — not for New Zealand, 
and not for a growing world that seeks freedom from 
hunger. 
 A better response to this challenge must be found. 
In my view, the response must draw on the power and 
possibility of science. Just as New Zealand is proud of 
its agricultural producers, so are we proud of our role 
in agricultural research. This research has resulted in 
scientific and technological advances that have 
improved production and fed virtually millions of 
people. 
 But advancing research in the area of emission 
reduction requires a commitment so broad that it is 
beyond the capacity of any one individual country. 
  
 
09-52470 32 
 
That is a challenge that requires collective action, and 
it is collective action that I call for today. 
 New Zealand has developed a proposal for a 
global alliance on the reduction of agricultural 
emissions. This alliance would undertake international 
research and investment into new technologies and 
practices to help reduce agriculture-related emissions 
and would seek to achieve greater coordination of 
existing efforts. 
 Through a global alliance we can find solutions 
faster, make better use of the money that is being spent 
around the world and encourage all countries and 
companies to do more. We have been delighted with 
the interest that our proposal has received so far, and 
we will continue working with others to explore the 
concept. Today, my call to other agricultural producers 
of the world is to rise to this challenge and join New 
Zealand in this research effort.  
 I now want to address some of the security crises 
that we confront. Yesterday I had the honour to observe 
the high-level Security Council meeting on 
disarmament and non-proliferation. As a country with a 
proud record of promoting nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation, I was heartened by the expressions 
of support for a world free of nuclear weapons. We 
must all take full advantage of this historic moment to 
advance the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
agenda. We owe it to our generation and to those who 
follow us to move our vision for a world free from 
nuclear weapons forward. As a proudly nuclear-free 
nation and a country that has been at the forefront of 
that debate since the 1970s, New Zealand stands ready 
to play its part.  
 We are optimistic about the prospects for 
progress. Last week, New Zealand presided over the 
General Conference of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency in Vienna, Austria. Preventing the spread of 
nuclear weapons through the implementation of 
safeguards under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
is a fundamental pillar of the Agency’s work. Next year 
sees the quinquennial review conference of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
 New Zealand will actively work with our New 
Agenda Coalition partners for a meaningful outcome at 
that conference to bring us closer to a truly secure 
world.  
 We will also continue to address the humanitarian 
harm caused by conventional weapons. We will work 
for a robust, action-oriented outcome later this year at 
the second review conference of the Ottawa 
Convention on Landmines. 
 Looking back, I am proud of the role that New 
Zealand was able to play in the negotiation of the 
Convention on Cluster Munitions. The Government 
attaches priority to passing legislation to enable us to 
ratify this very significant treaty. New Zealand also 
continues to play its part in maintaining and promoting 
international peace and security. 
 Peacekeeping remains one of this Organization’s 
most essential tasks and most solemn responsibilities to 
its Members. While United Nations peacekeeping has 
been significantly strengthened since the testing it 
underwent in the 1990s, the demands now being placed 
on it are severe. 
 I want to express my profound gratitude to those 
civilians and military personnel who place their lives at 
risk to support peace and live up to the ideals of the 
Charter of the United Nations. Ensuring that United 
Nations peacekeeping is as effective and responsive as 
possible must therefore remain one of the 
Organization’s most urgent priorities. 
 The United Nations provides the legal mandate — 
and often the operational effectiveness — for our joint 
efforts to achieve and maintain peace and security. New 
Zealand is firmly committed to supporting United 
Nations peacekeeping — both its own operations and 
others that it has mandated, such as those in which we 
are involved in Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands and 
Timor-Leste. 
 All too often, however, the United Nations has 
found itself unable to respond to emerging crises. New 
Zealand therefore strongly supports the concept of 
responsibility to protect. I am pleased at the solid 
foundation that the General Assembly’s recent debate 
on that responsibility has laid for its implementation. 
 New Zealand also strongly supports the 
International Criminal Court (ICC). It is a fundamental 
tenet of our domestic legal systems that wrongdoers 
must be brought to justice. The ICC is the mechanism 
for applying that same principle to persons accused of 
the most serious international crimes. 
 New Zealand takes very seriously its 
responsibilities for creating and maintaining peace and 
 
 
33 09-52470 
 
security in its region and in the world. I am therefore 
pleased to confirm New Zealand’s candidature for the 
United Nations Security Council for 2015-2016 in the 
elections to be held in 2014. In advancing its 
candidature, New Zealand does so as a State committed 
to upholding the international rule of law and to 
providing a strong and principled Pacific voice on 
behalf of small States like ourselves with an interest in 
a fairer and more secure world. 
 We all have a stake in a world where peace and 
the rule of law prevail, where all States are secure and 
can prosper and where all people are guaranteed the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms promised 
them in the Charter.  
 But we also know that solutions to the problems 
we collectively face do not lie with inspirational goals 
and promises that can be — and far too often are — 
quickly and quietly forgotten and ignored. Hard, 
pragmatic decisions must be made. Enforceable 
solutions must be implemented. 
 We know that effective, collective action is in 
every country’s long-term, national interest. That is 
what New Zealand believed in 1945, and I recommit 
now to taking action to live up to the ideals of the 
United Nations Charter, here, in this great Hall, this 
evening."
2828,64,2009,MHL,"I bring the greetings and 
best wishes of the people of the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands. I congratulate the President on his 
election to chair the Assembly at this session. He has 
our confidence and support.  
 I offer my gratitude to the United Nations for its 
continuing role in coordinating and leading the world’s 
efforts to meet challenges affecting the interests of all 
nations. The United Nations Joint Presence Office in 
the Marshall Islands has brought the ideals of the 
Organization closer to our people and country. Our 
hope is that other United Nations agencies — including 
the World Health Organization, the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the Food 
and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations 
 
 
51 09-52425 
 
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific — will follow suit and make their presence felt 
more prominently, producing concrete results on the 
ground. 
 I wish to acknowledge the personal commitment 
of the Secretary-General to meeting the challenges of 
climate change. His reminder to take our best to the 
table in Copenhagen in service of a higher calling to 
save the planet is well noted. His call for a clear moral 
imperative for bold and decisive urgent action and his 
recognition of the duty of the larger economies to the 
most vulnerable have not gone unnoticed by us small 
island States. Although some may consider as 
insufficient the Group of 8 commitment in Italy this 
year, I believe it is an encouraging and a necessary step 
forward. 
 We cherish the hope that the increasing 
participation of the United States in debates on issues 
relating to climate change is a signal of its intention to 
take its rightful place at the forefront of the global war 
against climate change. Likewise, we are encouraged 
by Japan’s bold and new commitment to address the 
adverse effects of climate change. 
 Let me express my appreciation to the Alliance of 
Small Island States (AOSIS) for its leadership in 
assisting small island developing countries to prepare 
for negotiations in Copenhagen. We assure AOSIS of 
our unwavering support. 
 Full of expectation, the world has its eyes on 
Copenhagen. It will be an event of historic significance 
where, despite our differences, everyone can now view 
the entire planet through a common perspective. 
 Now, a few weeks away from Copenhagen, I feel 
moved to ask what it is that we want to see happening 
in there. What kind of outcome do we expect? How 
should we and future generations judge the success of 
Copenhagen? 
 The answer, it seems to me, is a matter of 
perspective. Major economies will no doubt be 
watchful that Copenhagen does not disturb too much 
an established way of life and all its benefits. I ask 
these nations to consider the implicit moral obligation 
that comes with their privileged and affluent status. 
 For the small island States, however, the question 
is whether Copenhagen will diminish or enhance their 
security and their chances of survival, whether the 
populations of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau 
and others should make haste to evacuate and head to 
safer regions, as foreshadowed in a recent warning 
from the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
 Therefore, our message to the leaders in 
Copenhagen is clear: we appeal to them to strive with 
every fibre of their being to increase their level of 
commitment to combating climate change, to show the 
world by their deeds — not words — their unbending 
commitment to secure an effective post-Kyoto global 
agreement. We appeal to them to be as unrestrained as 
the wind and set the limit on the increase in global 
average temperature above the pre-industrial period at 
a level that will ensure our survival. We appeal to them 
to be fair-minded and to act with determination to 
reduce global emissions from 1990 levels by at least 
85 per cent by 2050. We appeal to them to ensure that 
global emissions peak no later than 2015. Finally, we 
appeal to the leaders of all nations to construct in 
Copenhagen the ark of salvation in which all nations 
and peoples will find shelter. 
 I believe that the success of Copenhagen will be 
ultimately judged by the extent to which small, low-
lying island States — the most vulnerable — will feel a 
sense of guaranteed safety and security. For, in our 
interdependent global community, the moral duty of 
the collective must always be the protection of the 
weak and the most vulnerable. 
 Short of that, however, Copenhagen will be no 
more than the continuation of the law of the jungle, the 
survival of the strongest. It will be a moral and 
political failure. For Copenhagen is not about 
mathematics. It is not about raw power; it is not 
competition for the survival of the few. It is about 
unleashing the moral and political forces and synergies 
inherent in the collective body of nations for the good 
of all. What else does political will mean but this? 
 Failure in Copenhagen will make a mockery of 
the Millennium Development Goals, for their 
achievement will be beyond our capacity to attain. It 
will question the ability of the Charter of the United 
Nations to safeguard our pre-existing sovereign rights. 
In short, the world and the most vulnerable in it cannot 
afford the cost of failure.  
 Closer to home, even though the rate of emission 
of the Marshall Islands is insignificant in relative 
terms, we have set for ourselves a reduction target of 
40 per cent by 2020. Over the years, and subject to 
  
 
09-52425 52 
 
accessibility of funding, we have been pursuing a 
systematic programme of solar power use. Nearly 40 
per cent of the households in our outer islands are now 
drawing on that power as one of their main sources of 
energy. We intend to pursue this initiative until all 33 
islands in our country are fully covered. On the 
Micronesian subregional front, we are committed to the 
goals of the Micronesia Challenge. 
 Our efforts to adapt continue to suffer from the 
lack of adequate funding, compounded by the sheer 
complexity in accessing it from the sources. 
Simplifying the process by direct access to those 
sources could enable us to fast-track some of our 
adaptation priorities, such as seawalls, coastal 
management and safe water projects. 
 I now turn to a matter that is very dear to the 
heart of every Marshallese. We are deeply encouraged 
by the Security Council meeting today, moderated by 
President Obama, on the use and testing of nuclear 
weapons.  
 Nuclear weapon testing was conducted on our 
islands between 1946 and 1958, at the time when we 
were a ward of the United Nations trusteeship system. 
Our first-hand experience as victims of nuclear weapon 
testing on our islands, and the painful memories that 
continue to haunt us after six decades, are nightmares 
we would not wish on anyone. The toll in human 
suffering and environmental damage has been 
devastating. Now, sixty years since the detonation of 
some 67 nuclear bombs, the Marshall Islands is still 
grappling with the after-effects. Complete recovery in 
terms of restoring affected islands to full economic 
productivity and adequate compensation of the victims 
remains uncertain. 
 We have not come here to condemn or to point 
fingers. However, we are compelled by our moral duty 
to humanity to raise our voice in gatherings such as 
this and to appeal to the conscience of the world 
community. We call for the formulation of a new 
perspective by which the spectre of war and of the use 
of nuclear weapons may forever be dismissed from the 
surface of the Earth.  
 Banning nuclear weapons will not by itself 
remove the root cause of war. Important as it may be, it 
does not exert an enduring influence. People are too 
ingenious not to invent still other forms of warfare. 
Political agreements or good intentions alone are not 
enough. The world craves something much more deep-
seated than pure pragmatism. It yearns for permanent 
peace that springs from an inner state supported by a 
moral attitude. 
 There is no lack of recognition by national 
leaders of the nature of the problem, but there is a 
paralysis of will. The stark realities of the experience 
of the people of the Marshall Islands have deepened 
our profound conviction that, in a world irreversibly 
moving towards a global society, it becomes imperative 
that we recast our perspective, a perspective in which 
national impulses and interests will find their fullest 
expression when subordinated to the needs and 
interests of the planet, our collective homeland, a 
perspective that does not regard that subordination as 
being disloyal to the nation. 
 Amid our deepening economic and financial 
woes, the Republic of the Marshall Islands continues to 
remain buoyant through the generous support of our 
friends and partners. Our special relationship with the 
United States within the framework of the Compact of 
Free Association provides a unique partnership that is 
enduring and stable. 
 We express our firm support for the efforts of the 
United States and its allies in combating terrorism, and 
we are proud of our young Marshallese men and 
women serving in the armed forces of the United 
States. The support also provided by Japan, the 
Republic of China (Taiwan), the European Union, 
Australia and our other donor partners is sincerely 
acknowledged. 
 The increasing complexity of the management of 
evolving global affairs demands a reconstitution of the 
membership of the Security Council. Japan’s 
distinguished leadership and achievements in the area 
of human security match its aspirations to seek a 
permanent seat on the Council and thus deserve 
favourable consideration. Evidence of progress in the 
confidence-building process between China and the 
Republic of China (Taiwan) deserves praise and 
encouragement from the international community. 
Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations 
specialized agencies will enable its 23 million people 
to play an active part in the affairs of the family of 
nations. 
 Not a single nation can escape the powerful grip 
of the challenges of climate change. Its deadly virus is 
here already. The remedy is clear: collective and 
resolute action, now more than ever. The choice is 
 
 
53 09-52425 
 
ours. We implore Almighty God to give us courage and 
wisdom. "
2855,64,2009,AUS,"I come to the Assembly, as 
Australia has each year since the first session of the 
General Assembly in 1946, and I come in the same 
spirit, to seek solutions to the great challenges of our 
age and together help give those solutions effect. 
 The challenges are not new. They are reflected in 
the Preamble to the Charter which we, as an 
international community, crafted together: “to save 
succeeding generations from the scourge of war”, to 
advance economic growth and social progress for all, 
“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights … in 
the equal rights of men and women and of nations large 
and small”. All those great undertakings were to be 
reflected in a new body of international law. 
 Two thirds of a century later these great 
international values remain constant, while the 
challenges to which we apply them are subject to 
continuing change. It is on the current challenges 
facing the global order that I wish to speak to the 
General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session today: the 
global financial crisis, the unfinished business of the 
Doha Round, the unfolding crisis of the planet itself, 
unresolved questions of nuclear weapons 20 years after 
the end of the cold war, and the future of global 
governance itself. 
 Just on a year ago, just down the road from here, 
a destructive chain of events triggered the worst global 
financial crisis in three quarters of a century. It was 
just on a year ago that I addressed the Assembly for the 
first time, 10 days after the collapse of Lehman 
 
 
45 09-52228 
 
Brothers, to reflect on the challenges which lay ahead 
for the proper regulation of global financial markets. 
 That reform programme is now under way, 
through the Group of 20 (G-20), the Financial Stability 
Board and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But 
there remains much work to be done to prevent the 
unrestrained greed of unregulated financial markets 
that has wrought such economic carnage across the 
world in the past 12 months from sowing the seeds of 
future financial crises. 
 The global financial crisis has been a wake-up 
call to the international community to reform the 
institutions of global governance, and a wake-up call 
that our system of global governance today is in need 
of radical reform. Because the truth is that the failure 
of these institutions is not just a matter of concern for 
Governments and for diplomats and for economists; the 
price of the failure of these institutions has been paid 
by working people and their families right across the 
world.  
 The events on Wall Street spread rapidly and 
indiscriminately to every corner of the globe, from 
London to Lima, from Beijing to Barcelona, from 
Melbourne to Mumbai, to developed and developing 
economies. This global financial crisis and its ensuing 
economic and employment crisis has been no respecter 
of national boundaries, and no respecter of peoples. 
 Australia has been no exception. The global 
financial crisis saw the Australian stock market fall by 
55 per cent. It wiped around A$ 150 billion from the 
retirement savings of Australian workers. And it led to 
tens of thousands of Australians losing their jobs. We 
expect more job losses to follow. Behind each of these 
statistics lie the faces of working Australians, who 
have seen their savings diminished, their financial 
security eroded and their job security threatened.  
 I think of places like Liverpool in Sydney, where 
the decline in its light manufacturing base has led to an 
increase in unemployment of 4.5 per cent over the past 
year, and where now 19,000 local people are without 
work; like the tourist destination of Cairns in far North 
Queensland, where unemployment has risen by 3.7 per 
cent over the past year, meaning that 13,300 people are 
now out of work in that area; and like the south-eastern 
suburbs of Perth, where unemployment has risen by 
3.3 per cent in the past year, leaving 12,800 people in 
that community without a job as well.  
 In communities like those across Australia the 
global recession is hurting in very real ways, just as in 
communities like them across the world the global 
recession is hurting in very real ways. We can never 
forget these men, these women, and their families, as 
we seek to find a path out of this global recession.  
 While our global economic system failed 
comprehensively to prevent the crisis, the G-20 
Governments have rallied to reduce the damage and 
prevent systemic collapse. Through the agency of the 
G-20, for the first time involving heads of Government 
from the major developed and developing economies, 
Governments acted in concert to provide around 
$13.6 trillion-worth of support to directly stabilize the 
global financial system; to inject $5.5 trillion-worth of 
fiscal stimulus into the global economy; to provide 
$1.1 trillion in resources to the international financial 
institutions, to give markets confidence that any 
subsequent collapses could be dealt with; to develop 
also an integrated framework of toxic asset 
management to repair the balance sheets of many 
major banks; and to initiate a comprehensive financial 
markets reform programme, through the Financial 
Stability Board.  
 The IMF has assessed that these extraordinary 
interventions succeeded in breaking the fall in what 
was an economic crisis spiralling out of control. 
 But the truth is that our global economic recovery 
is far from certain, and that many twists and turns lie 
ahead. Furthermore, the institutions of global economic 
governance are facing new challenges. First, the 
financial market reform programme must be completed 
and implemented to prevent a future crisis. Secondly, 
in anticipation of global economic recovery, we must 
agree on a framework for the coordinated withdrawal 
of our emergency interventions. And, thirdly, and most 
critically, we must articulate a new framework for 
sustainable future economic growth, a framework that 
does not simply return to business as usual, based on 
unsustainable financial imbalances and excessive 
consumption, fuelled by consumer and corporate debt 
and irresponsible risk-taking in systemically significant 
financial institutions. 
 One of the failures of the old growth model of the 
last decade was the lack of effective global economic 
coordination. This allowed imbalances to grow 
unchecked and financial institutions to remain 
inadequately supervised. As we move towards 
  
 
09-52228 46 
 
recovery, we must build a framework to foster both 
growth and balance in the global economy. The IMF 
estimates that effectively implemented coordination 
between major economies could add significantly to 
global growth — an additional 10 per cent to global 
output, or around $6 trillion over a five-year period. To 
achieve this coordination dividend the G-20 will need 
to build on the structures of cooperation that have been 
established during the crisis and apply them to the new 
challenges of the global recovery.  
 In Pittsburgh we have a historic opportunity to 
agree on a framework to deliver effective coordination 
of our national economic policies. This framework 
should have four key elements.  
 First, G-20 members should agree on a common 
objective to achieve balanced and sustainable growth. 
Secondly, G-20 members should outline their own 
national economic strategy and identify how it 
contributes to our common objectives. Thirdly, the IMF 
should analyse individual national economic plans to 
determine whether they are consistent and collectively 
adequate to achieve sustainable and balanced global 
growth. And, fourthly, this report should be submitted 
to the G-20 to form the basis of peer review, which 
would identify specific risks and vulnerabilities for the 
future. This framework should be consistent with, and 
an important input to, the development of a set of 
global principles, such as the current proposal from 
Germany for a charter for sustainable economic 
activity. 
 The other great global challenge of our age is 
climate change. With only 74 days remaining until 
Copenhagen, the Governments of the world are far 
from agreement. Enough has been said about the need 
for action on climate change, but as of today not 
enough action has been taken. Our collective political 
will to date has not been adequate to meet the task. For 
too long discussions between developed and 
developing countries have degenerated into mutual 
recrimination, with developing countries accusing 
developed countries of failing to meet their obligations, 
given their undeniable responsibility for the bulk of 
greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere, 
and developed countries warning the major emerging 
economies that unless they take action global warming 
will increase to unacceptable levels, based on emerging 
economy emissions alone.  
 The trouble is that both arguments are right. What 
is required globally is the leadership to embrace this 
truth and respond to it accordingly, because the truth is 
that all our Governments need to reach beyond their 
self-interests and instead fashion a grand bargain 
between the developed and the developing countries of 
the world: a grand bargain on climate change which 
embraces both historical and future responsibility; a 
grand bargain which is anchored in the science of 
climate change and the need to keep temperature rises 
within 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic climate 
change; a grand bargain embracing the three great 
challenges of climate change which we are yet to 
resolve.  
 Those three challenges are to answer these 
questions: what binding targets and commitments must 
developed and developing countries adopt to keep 
temperature rises within 2 degrees Celsius; what public 
and private climate change financing arrangements are 
necessary to support the mitigation and adaptation 
measures we need to implement in the future; and what 
technology transfer do we need to undertake in 
renewable energy, in carbon capture and storage, in 
energy efficiency and in the avoidance of deforestation 
and forest degradation to bring about real reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions?  
 In the period ahead, the grand bargain we must 
strike needs to resolve all three of those challenges, as 
each is inextricably dependent on the other. We must 
make use of all available mechanisms for international 
cooperation, including the Major Economies Forum 
and the G-20, to achieve success in the negotiations. 
For us all, this will be a test of our leadership, 
leadership which seeks to lift our collective vision 
beyond today and instead focus on the needs of 
tomorrow.  
 But time is short. As Chair of the Pacific Islands 
Forum, I know that time is already running out for the 
island States of the Pacific. Coastal inundation is not a 
prospect; it is a reality. Fifty per cent of the population 
of those island States reside within 1.5 km of the coast. 
The South Pacific is part of the human face of climate 
change. And that is why Australia, nationally, 
regionally and globally, stands ready to play its part in 
acting on this great moral, environmental and 
economic challenge of our time. 
 This Organization was born in the shadow of 
nuclear weapons; that shadow remains today. One truth 
 
 
47 09-52228 
 
remains absolutely clear: the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons can never make any country more secure. The 
nuclear test by North Korea this year was rightly 
condemned across the international community. It 
reiterates that the only path to safety is through the 
eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. Australia is 
encouraged by the commitment of the United States 
and Russia to further reduce their nuclear arsenals, but 
the international community must also progress the 
broader disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.  
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has played a 
crucial role in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, 
but the Treaty today is under grave challenge. We must 
work to ensure that its global security benefits are 
reinforced by a successful Review Conference in 2010. 
To reinvigorate global consensus and activism ahead of 
that Conference and beyond, Australia and Japan last 
year established the International Commission on 
Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, which in 
the next few months will produce its final report. Its aim 
is to chart a practical and realistic course to achieve a 
strengthened non-proliferation disarmament regime, 
leading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals.  
 Tomorrow’s Security Council summit on 
non-proliferation and disarmament is important for us 
all. We must not miss the opportunity it offers to 
summon the political resolve to move towards a 
nuclear-weapons-free world. 
 The challenges of global governance extend 
beyond the global financial crisis, climate change and 
the threat of nuclear weapons. The realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals is fundamental to the 
elimination of extreme poverty. It remains an obscenity 
that in 2009, after an age of unprecedented global 
prosperity, 1.5 billion of our fellow human beings are 
living in extreme poverty. That is a core reason why 
the Australian Government has committed to 
increasing official development assistance to 0.5 per 
cent of gross national income, to help close the 
development gap which has been widening in many 
Pacific island countries, while also helping, where  
 
 
possible, to deal with poverty elsewhere in Asia, 
Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
 Parallel to the Millennium Development Goals, 
the Doha Development Round has now been going for 
eight years. This is too long. The negotiating gap 
between us all is not wide, but the deficit in political 
will to conclude the Round seems vast. As the world 
searches for a new growth formula to sustain long-term 
economic recovery, surely Doha represents one critical 
element? Australia, as one of the lead negotiators 
within the Doha Round, remains ready to help bridge 
the negotiating gap. 
 Let the Assembly also not forget the continuing 
critical work of the United Nations across the full 
spectrum of global governance — issues concerning 
international peacekeeping operations, humanitarian 
operations, food security, women, health, children and 
refugees — all hallmarks of a civilized global order. 
 The United Nations is not a place; it is not an 
institution. The United Nations is us, “We, the peoples 
of the United Nations”, as the Charter begins. It is we 
who must find solutions to the problems we face, build 
consensus around those solutions, and implement them. 
This Organization had its beginnings not in an act of 
will, though will was certainly needed, but in an act of 
imagination, an idea of what the world should and 
could be. This is the challenge of leadership: to 
imagine a future worth having and then craft that 
vision into a practical and present reality. 
 That was the challenge to which our forebears 
rose in 1945. That is the challenge to which our 
generation must now rise for the future."
2871,64,2009,KIR,"I am indeed honoured to address 
this body on behalf of the people of Kiribati, but let me 
start by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption 
of the presidency of the General Assembly at this 
session. The tasks ahead of him and indeed ahead of us 
all are challenging. I am confident, however, that with 
cooperative efforts and commitment from all of us and 
with the President’s able leadership of this session, we 
should be able to rise to the challenge before us. I also 
take the opportunity to thank the President’s 
predecessor, Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann, for his 
commendable leadership during the previous session. 
 Every year, we gather in this Hall to deliberate on 
the daunting challenges that continue to confront us as 
citizens of the international community. We gather as 
leaders to find solutions to these challenges that will 
ensure the survival of humanity not just today but 
tomorrow and beyond. 
 Climate change is indeed the greatest moral 
challenge to humanity in our time, and I fear that our 
children and grandchildren will look back and ask us 
the question: “How is it that they knew what they knew 
yet they did so little?” We simply cannot afford the 
consequences of inaction. The people of my country 
are already feeling the impacts of climate change, 
which will only worsen over time. We, together with 
those of other low-lying States, will become victims of 
climate change. 
 I have been advocating a combination of 
pragmatic adaptation strategies for my people. It is our 
overwhelming desire to maintain our homeland and our 
sovereignty. However, with the inevitable decline in 
the ability of our islands to support life — let alone 
increasing populations — due to rising sea levels, we 
must also provide opportunities for those of our people 
who wish to migrate to be able to do so on merit and 
with dignity. Our approaches will be time-relevant, 
responding to the different levels of threat and impacts 
of climate change on our islands and our people as 
time goes by.  
 We expect greenhouse gas emitters to take 
appropriate action to mitigate these negative effects. 
We ask for assistance with our adaptation efforts and 
we ask those who might need our labour to be able to 
open their doors. It is important to stress that these 
options are not mutually exclusive. 
 The President returned to the Chair. 
 Our relocation strategy requires the support of the 
international community. On previous occasions, I 
have referred to existing initiatives with our regional 
development partners, and I wish to say again that I am 
grateful to the Governments of New Zealand and 
Australia for their support through the Pacific Access 
Category scheme, the Kiribati Australia Nursing 
Initiative and the Australia-Pacific Technical College 
programme. These are models that we believe can be 
implemented more broadly as a win-win option for all 
concerned. Pacific leaders have agreed to work 
together to address climate change through the 2008 
Niue Declaration on Climate Change.  
 Internationally, the declaration adopted by 
Alliance of Small Island States leaders a few days ago 
outlines the issues of importance to small island 
developing States and calls for action on climate 
change, particularly leading up to Copenhagen. 
Resolution 63/281 on climate change and its possible 
security implications is a landmark decision of the 
General Assembly that acknowledges the link between 
climate change and security. I commend our Pacific 
ambassadors in New York for initiating and driving 
that resolution, and I thank the sponsors for their 
support. 
 I appreciate that reaching consensus in 
Copenhagen will not be an easy task, but I do believe 
that it is possible and that it is imperative that we do 
so. If we can mobilize trillions of dollars to address the 
challenges of the global economic crisis, then we must 
be equally capable of taking the action necessary to 
 
 
27 09-52463 
 
deal with the challenges of the global environment. 
Over the past few days, I have been deeply heartened 
to see leaders’ strong commitment to tackling this 
common challenge together, to hear leaders resolve to 
look beyond national interests and focus on the global 
interest, and by their understanding of the predicament 
of those on the front line of climate change.  
 To be able to see leaders’ strong determination to 
seal the deal in Copenhagen — a deal that, among 
other things, will address the plight of the most 
vulnerable — has given me hope and restored my faith 
in humanity and in the relevance of our global 
community and our global leadership. I take this 
opportunity to strongly commend the Secretary-
General for his initiative in organizing the high-level 
Summit on Climate Change. That Summit provided us 
with the opportunity as leaders to talk face to face and 
to agree on a way forward for the climate change 
negotiations. I also thank my fellow leaders for their 
understanding, compassion and political will 
collectively to address this crisis and its impacts. 
 It is now absolutely necessary that we capitalize 
on this collective political will. We must direct our 
negotiators to act accordingly to ensure that our 
common resolve as leaders is in fact given effect. I 
know that we will not be able to agree on all issues, but 
at the same time I am sure there are some fundamental 
issues that we cannot afford not to agree on. Let us not 
waste any more time on diplomatic talk, language, 
drafting of amendments, posturing and empty 
platitudes. We know what needs to be done. It has been 
called many things — a new world order, the grand 
bargain, a new green deal — but Copenhagen gives us 
the opportunity to enter into a global compact for 
action on climate change between developed and 
developing countries, North and South, East and West. 
This might be our last chance. If we do not act now, 
who the hell is going to do it? 
 We have declared the Phoenix Islands Protected 
Area (PIPA), the largest marine protected area in the 
world, covering more than 400,000 square kilometres 
of ocean area. It constitutes something like 11 per cent 
of our exclusive economic zone. PIPA is a collective 
partnership between my Government, Conservation 
International and New England Aquarium. The 
preservation of the Phoenix Islands and the 
surrounding ocean is our gift, our statement to 
humanity, in the face of climate change. It is our 
contribution to international efforts to significantly 
reduce biodiversity loss by the year 2010. Even now as 
we confront the possibility that our islands will become 
uninhabitable within this century due to rising sea 
levels, we recognize the value of protecting something 
that we firmly believe to be the common heritage of all 
mankind. 
 We are indeed encouraged to see the emergence 
of ocean conservation and management initiatives in 
the Pacific. Such initiatives include the Micronesia 
Challenge, the Coral Triangle Initiative and the Nauru 
Agreement. Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to 
the sustainable conservation and management of its 
oceans. At the Pacific Islands Forum in Australia last 
month, the leaders of the Pacific adopted the Pacific 
Oceanscape initiative, aimed at promoting 
collaboration and exchanges between marine protected 
areas in the region and with other partners. We call for 
support for this initiative from the international 
community. 
 The impacts of the climate crisis, the 
international financial crisis and the food and energy 
crisis have ended our efforts to achieve sustainable 
development and our way forward towards achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals. The particular 
economic and environment vulnerability of Kiribati as 
a small island developing State should be taken into 
account when considering us for graduation from least 
developed country status. Assistance provided to the 
least developed countries helps us at this point in time 
in our efforts to address challenges we face as a nation. 
To lose that assistance would be detrimental to our 
efforts and to the livelihood of our people. We reiterate 
our call to the United Nations to reconsider the listing 
for the graduation of Kiribati and other countries in the 
Pacific. 
 On the issue of global governance, the United 
Nations is undergoing change to adapt to the realities 
of our time. It must maintain its relevance if it is to 
address the security challenges that the world continues 
to face. We believe that the United Nations should be 
an inclusive Organization, particularly for States such 
as Taiwan that make a contribution to world harmony 
and have demonstrated time and again their willingness 
and ability to contribute positively to international 
cooperative efforts. Taiwan has demonstrated its 
commitment to international peace and security 
through its contributions to national, regional and 
international development programmes. It is only fair 
and fitting, therefore, that Taiwan should be allowed to 
  
 
09-52463 28 
 
participate meaningfully in meetings and activities of 
the United Nations organs. Given the impact of climate 
change and the demands of aviation safety and security 
on its development and the well-being of its people, we 
now appeal for the meaningful participation of Taiwan 
in the work and activities of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
 In concluding, in the face of the common 
challenges facing the global community, it is 
encouraging to hear leaders call for a new global order 
in which our interests as fellow citizens of the planet 
override our national interests, particularly where 
global human security and lives are under serious 
threat. This goal reaffirms the principle of collective 
responsibility for the common challenges that we face.  
 The United Nations will and must continue to 
play a significant role in the new world order, 
particularly in mobilizing the political will and the 
necessary action and resources required to implement 
it. Copenhagen will be the test of the political will and 
commitment that we have declared over the past few 
days as leaders. It will determine the fate of the most 
vulnerable and eventually the whole of humanity."
2888,64,2009,PNG,"It is indeed my 
honour and privilege, Mr. President, to bring you, on 
behalf of the people and Government of Papua New 
Guinea, our warmest greetings and to pledge our 
support as you preside over the General Assembly at its 
sixty-fourth session. We thank your predecessor, His 
Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for his 
strong leadership during his tenure as President of the 
Assembly at its sixty-third session. 
 We would like to reiterate our support for the 
Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the United 
Nations agencies such as the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF for 
their efforts to enhance the benevolent work they do 
for the world and Papua New Guinea. 
 When God distributed the peoples of the world 
everywhere, he wedged in Papua New Guinea, a small 
country of 6.5 million people, between the South 
Pacific and the South-East Asia. It has been a privilege 
that has allowed us to appreciate the peaceful and 
colourful people of the Pacific as well as the dynamic 
nations of South-East Asia. We may not be a large 
country or a country of economic or military power, 
but in our own way and from our own standpoint, we 
have a right to contribute to the world among other 
nations, to collectively approach issues and problems 
and to speak out whether in support or in disagreement. 
 Very recently, on 16 September, we celebrated the 
thirty-fourth anniversary of our independence. But an 
important achievement for us was the fact that by the 
grace of God, we have had an unbroken constitutional 
democracy for those 34 years. Our current Prime 
Minister, the Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, has 
been in Parliament for 41 years. He is the founding 
Prime Minister and has been ousted only through a 
parliamentary constitutional vote and has returned 
three times as Prime Minister, the current term being 
his fourth. I am mentioning this because Papua New 
Guinea is contributing to democracy in the world. 
Through its democratic form of government, in a 
nation of over 800 languages and cultures, a people of 
diversity can find a way towards harmony and political 
acceptance of one another. 
 We are proud of that achievement, but we are also 
mindful of the many critical challenges that lie ahead 
 
 
5 09-53165 
 
of us as we develop and progress. Many are challenges 
that cannot be handled by one individual country — 
whether large or small — on its own. The United 
Nations must therefore continue to provide the global 
forum for all Member States, big and small, powerful 
and weak, to come together to address the many global 
issues and challenges we face collectively as a human 
family. And together we must confront, first, the 
continuing threats of climate change and global 
warming, the global food crisis now compounded by 
the global financial crisis, and the threats of diseases 
that know no borders, such as H1N1, HIV/AIDS, 
malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, et cetera. Secondly, we 
must achieve together the social agenda of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
 Papua New Guinea firmly believes that 
strengthening international peace and security is 
fundamental and is a prerequisite to achieving human 
development, progress and prosperity. My country 
denounces weapons of mass destruction and is fully 
committed to the principles of a world free from 
weapons of mass terror. That is attested to by the fact 
that we are a State party to the South Pacific Nuclear 
Free Zone Treaty and also fully support the Treaty on 
the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. 
 We are now working earnestly towards early 
ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty. We also look forward to contributing 
constructively to United Nations peacekeeping 
operations. Papua New Guinea therefore welcomes 
positive initiatives of the new United States 
Government and other like-minded countries to 
enhance the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
encourage disarmament. 
 A continuing major concern of Papua New 
Guinea is the increase in global conflicts heightened by 
the illicit trade and use of small arms and light 
weapons, which continue to cause untold suffering to 
millions of people around the world. The people of 
Papua New Guinea are no exception. The global debate 
on small arms has focused on curbing their use. 
However, the supply side of weapons is never 
comprehensively discussed. We therefore support a 
proposed arms trade treaty, which is still in 
negotiations and which will deal with one of the key 
elements of the arms issue. 
 In Papua New Guinea we have seen the presence 
of small arms and light weapons threaten the stability 
of communities. My Government prioritized the need 
to comprehensively address this issue through 
commissioning the 2005 National Gun Summit Report, 
which will be implemented soon. 
 The various global crises of today have had a 
disproportionate negative impact on many developing 
countries. From falling commodity prices to increases 
in food and energy costs, the damages caused and the 
costs incurred to redress them have heavily impacted 
their development. The impact of the crisis has also 
reduced levels of official development assistance 
globally and resulted in big shortfalls in the national 
budgets of developing countries.  
 While we appreciate that many countries have 
had to assist their economies by massive injections of 
capital, we nevertheless support the strong call for 
reforms of the international financial architecture to 
include major developing countries like China and 
India. Such reforms would better reflect today’s global 
economic realities and provide effective management 
of the global process, which needs to be fair, equitable 
and transparent. 
 At the 2005 World Summit, leaders agreed to a 
set of broad reforms to the United Nations. Since then, 
the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding 
Commission have been established. Furthermore, the 
concept of the responsibility to protect has received 
broad support, with an inclusive process now under 
way to better elaborate it. 
 We support the continuing call for the reform of 
the Security Council in both the permanent and 
non-permanent membership categories. In this regard, 
we support the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations 
within the General Assembly, which have seen the 
emergence of strong agreement on certain issues. 
 We note that great strides are being made in 
reforming the global gender architecture. We applaud 
the strong but cautious consensus reached at the sixty-
third session of the General Assembly to support the 
creation of an Under-Secretary-General post to assist in 
better management of the various United Nations 
entities dealing with the gender issues. We take note of 
and commend the work of former Prime Minister of 
New Zealand, Her Excellency Helen Clark, as the 
UNDP Administrator. We therefore strongly support 
the ongoing reform, as the gender issue in its entirety 
 
 
09-53165 6 
 
remains one of the key policy issues of my 
Government. 
 As a growing democracy in the Pacific, it is my 
Government’s desire to see our friends and neighbours 
in the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and 
prosperity. We reaffirm our continuing support for our 
Pacific neighbours in their development aspirations. 
We feel that on the issue of Fiji we need to continue 
dialogue and not to isolate them. We also support the 
main thrust of the Pacific Plan and encourage our 
Forum dialogue partners to assist with its ongoing 
implementation, as we believe it will catalyse the 
Pacific region’s development. 
 The social sector of many of our developing 
countries suffers greatly, and the United Nations has 
quite rightly set the Millennium Development Goals. 
They provide us with one of the greatest opportunities 
to leverage our development process. We commend and 
strongly support the Secretary-General for his proposal 
to convene a high-level session on the MDGs in 
September 2010. 
 Achieving the MDGs remains an integral 
development priority of our Government. We are 
working to achieve the Goals in close cooperation with 
all stakeholders, including civil society and 
international development partners such as the United 
Nations and its agencies, the Commonwealth, the 
Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the South Pacific 
Community.  
 The MDGs have been incorporated into our 
Medium-Term Development Strategy, which focuses 
on 15 national targets and 67 indicators under the 
National Road Map. They are specifically designed for 
Papua New Guinea to reflect the nation’s stage of 
development. MDG 8 is ongoing through international 
cooperation with bilateral and multilateral development 
partners. 
 The Joint MDGs Project was launched in August 
2008 and comprises the National MDGs Steering 
Committee, made up of representatives of the 
Government, the United Nations, academia and civil 
society. The Project is mandated to build national 
awareness and facilitate a strong data collection and 
analysis regime in the country. The Project also serves 
as a constituency for the Medium-Term Development 
Strategy and the MDGs. 
 The Government has localized the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness by reaffirming its 
principles in the Kavieng Declaration to foster 
collaborative commitments with our development 
partners in pursuing the achievement of the MDGs. 
Our long-term aim is to grow our economy to such a 
level as to allow us to exit from our dependency on aid. 
We want to be economically independent; we choose 
not to be aid-dependent forever. We want to give aid 
and not receive it. Our aim is also to assist others from 
the richness of God’s blessings on us. 
 The Government recognizes that greater and 
sustained commitment to implement policies at all 
levels is needed to achieve the MDGs. That 
commitment will also be supported by ongoing public 
sector reforms, especially in relation to delivery of 
basic services to our rural majority.  
 For the MDGs to be achieved, strong and viable 
partnerships must exist.  
 MDG 8 is critical to the achievement of the other 
seven Goals. However, all our partnerships must be 
underpinned by mutual respect between the partners 
and the Government. Some of our key partners include 
Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, 
China, the United States, Italy and Austria, along with 
many non-governmental organizations, such as the 
Clinton Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation, which continue to strongly contribute to 
Papua New Guinea’s development. 
 Climate change has emerged as one of the 
greatest crises now facing humanity. The consequences 
appear dire, and they are truly global. Such a global 
challenge can only be met by a concerted global 
response. 
 In Papua New Guinea today, we see evidence of 
climate change in the inundation of coastal areas, an 
increase in malaria due to warming in the highlands 
region of the country, and especially in the plight of the 
people of the Carteret Islands, where sea level has risen 
and some 1,200 people have had to be resettled. 
 We therefore strongly support the recent Alliance 
of Small Island States declaration on climate change. 
For many small island States to survive, we must strive 
to roll back atmospheric carbon concentrations to less 
than 350 parts per million and limit temperature rise to 
less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, emissions of 
greenhouse gases must peak by 2015 and be followed 
 
 
7 09-53165 
 
by reductions of 45 per cent by 2020 and 90 per cent 
before 2050. Further, we will require healthy and 
expanded forest cover and widely available low carbon 
technologies, including carbon capture and storage. 
 In this context, the importance and urgency of 
extensive action on reducing emissions from 
deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) can 
hardly be overstated, and many delegations have 
spoken on it. Deforestation continues at an alarming 
pace, with around 13 million hectares of the world’s 
forests being lost annually — an area the size of 
Denmark, Norway and Belgium combined. 
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) estimates that deforestation and degradation in 
developing countries may contribute to approximately 
20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused 
by humans, while also representing around 30 per cent 
of the total cost-effective mitigation potential in the 
period up to 2020. Any solution to the problem should 
thus attract 20 per cent of any financial or institutional 
response. 
 It is worth stressing that, without rapid and 
significant reductions in emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation in developing countries, added 
to deep emissions reductions by rich countries, it may 
be impossible to avoid global warming levels that will 
prove catastrophic for many vulnerable nations. 
Without question, immediate action on REDD+ is a 
crucial part of the climate change solution. Under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, we will therefore require strong institutional 
frameworks for REDD+, including accommodating 
different national circumstances and providing for 
resource mobilization. 
 We also recognize the excellent work and 
analysis under way via the Informal Working Group on 
Interim Finance for REDD. This work estimates that, if 
a total of €15 to €25 billion were provided to catalyse 
early action from 2010 to 2015, then a 25 per cent 
reduction in annual global deforestation rates may be 
achieved by around 2015. 
 Deforestation and degradation in developing 
countries are the results of the stark economic need for 
local communities to survive that propels the 
destruction of forests. How do we keep the trees 
standing to sequester carbon? 
 There is hope. Significantly, early actions for 
REDD+ can be achieved at a reasonable cost, while 
protecting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and 
local communities, protecting biodiversity, rainfall 
patterns and soil quality, and helping countries to adapt 
to climate change. To succeed, a REDD+ mechanism 
should accommodate countries at different levels of 
development through a phased approach. The 
agreement should be results-based and incentives-
driven. To achieve that, it must include both a reliable 
framework for monitoring, reporting and verification, 
and encourage a predictable and sustainable system for 
financing. 
 We must succeed in Copenhagen. If we are to 
succeed, rich countries must come forward and take the 
lead. Without their collective leadership on emissions 
reductions, finance and technology, the Governments 
of developing countries will not be able to make a 
compelling case at home to get people to allow trees to 
be left standing. As a result, 20 per cent of carbon 
emissions will continue to flow into the atmosphere. 
Therefore, let me be candid. Without a transformative 
grand financial bargain in Copenhagen that involves all 
nations, there could be no deal. 
 Let me conclude by repeating that the United 
Nations is the forum for agreeing on solutions for 
problems and challenges. In times of global crises such 
as climate change, financial meltdown and social 
sector vulnerabilities, there is also opportunity. Indeed, 
there is opportunity here, if we remember that MDG 8 
allows us to leverage the greatest asset we have: strong 
partnerships between nations, both rich and poor. 
 More than ever before, we need the political will 
of the leading developed and developing countries, for 
the sake of the children of the world and for 
generations after them. I ask the General Assembly to 
please consider this and make a stroke for history."
2904,64,2009,PLW,"I am speaking for the first 
time as Head of State. However, in 1977 I appeared 
with my country’s delegation before the Trusteeship 
Council, seeking independence. In 1994, the 
trusteeship ended and we took our place as a Member 
of the United Nations. Our independence is testament 
to the success of the International Trusteeship System, 
for which we are grateful. The legacy of our experience 
is a Constitution that incorporates the rights and 
freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights: freedom, democracy, equal protection 
and the rule of law. 
 We thank the permanent members of the Security 
Council, which recognized our sovereignty: the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 
French Republic, the Russian Federation, the People’s 
Republic of China and the United States of America. 
The United States was our Administering Authority, 
and we express our deep appreciation to it for 
becoming our close partner under the Compact of Free 
Association, a relationship we cherish and one that we 
hope will endure. 
 As a new and young Member, Palau has 
shouldered its responsibilities in the community of 
nations, including the deployment of peacekeepers to 
Darfur, Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. When 
signing international conventions and meeting our 
counter-terrorism obligations, as set forth by the 
Security Council, we remember and honour the legacy 
of the United Nations. 
 While our political progress has been satisfactory 
since independence, I must report to you that we are 
now confronted with several looming threats to our 
continued peaceful way of life, and indeed to our very 
existence. Climate change, environmental degradation 
and the world financial crisis are challenges that we 
will only be able to overcome if we work with the 
international community. 
 We associate ourselves with the statements of 
concern on climate change which we heard in this Hall 
earlier this week. We applaud the commitments made 
and note that we must use our best efforts to stop this 
slow-moving tsunami that threatens to engulf us. To 
this end, Palau and our neighbours in the Federated 
States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands have adopted a joint policy, known as Green 
Energy Micronesia (GEM) to move to renewable 
energy as a pillar of our collective energy security. 
Furthermore, Palau has signed the Statute of the 
International Renewable Energy Agency, and we look 
forward to the exciting work that will emanate from the 
United Arab Emirates. We are hopeful that the 
combined efforts of all our nations will lead to a 
fruitful outcome in Copenhagen. 
 We note in particular the statement of the new 
Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Yukio Hatoyama. Japan’s 
vision and commitment to save our planet are 
inspiring. This is one of the many reasons we support a 
permanent seat for Japan on the Security Council. 
 We reiterate that climate change is indeed a 
cross-cutting issue and that all aspects of it, especially 
the security impact of climate change, need to be 
examined. This is why Palau and the Pacific Small 
Island Developing States initiated General Assembly 
resolution 63/281, on “Climate change and its possible 
security implications”. We look forward to meaningful 
action by the Security Council on that resolution. 
 Palauans have lived throughout history in 
symbiosis with the sea. Now, though, the sea, which 
has long been the source of our sustenance, is 
simultaneously rising in rage to destroy us and 
becoming barren. This fury was caused by abuses by 
humankind, and we therefore must take every 
necessary action to allow the oceans to heal 
themselves. In days gone by, the traditional chiefs of 
Palau would declare a bul — a moratorium to protect a 
resource that had become scarce. This traditional 
concept, now popularly known as conservation, shows 
the way for us to move forward. As Mahatma Gandhi 
said, “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s 
need, but not every man’s greed”. 
 This is why the world must declare a bul on 
destructive fishing practices like deep-sea bottom 
trawling, unsustainable harvesting of shark for their 
fins and overexploitation of tuna stocks. The odious 
fishing practice of bottom trawling, where a weighted 
net is dragged along the sea floor, crushing nearly 
everything in its path, is contributing to the rapid loss 
of a critical ecosystem, our coral reefs. We have 
outlawed deep-sea bottom trawling in Palau, but, no 
matter what we do in our own waters, there must be an 
international solution. For several years, we, along 
with our Pacific neighbours, have advocated a 
  
 
09-52463 8 
 
moratorium on this practice. The sustainable fisheries 
resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 
(resolution 62/177) urged nations and regional fishery 
management organizations to stop trawling in sensitive 
areas by 2009. We have waited for compliance, which 
has not come, and we now renew our call for a 
worldwide moratorium on this practice. 
 An equally destructive fishing practice is shark-
finning. We have banned it in Palau and call upon the 
world to address this issue in order to save sharks from 
extinction. The physical strength and beauty of sharks 
are a natural barometer of the health of our oceans. 
Therefore, I declare today that Palau will become the 
world’s first national shark sanctuary, ending all 
commercial shark fishing in our waters and giving a 
sanctuary for sharks to live and reproduce unmolested 
in our 237,000 square miles of ocean. We call upon all 
nations to join us. The need to save sharks and our 
environment far outweighs the need to enjoy a bowl of 
shark’s fin soup. 
 It is anomalous that Palau is experiencing 
economic difficulty while it sits in the middle of the 
richest fishing grounds in the world, the Pacific Ocean. 
We can no longer stand by while foreign vessels 
illicitly come to our waters to take our greatest 
resource, our tuna stocks, without regard for their 
conservation and without regard for adequate 
compensation to the island States that own the fishing 
grounds and rely on this resource. Palau believes that 
the best model for a regional effort to conserve our 
tuna resources and maximize the benefits to us is the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC). I will therefore work for the establishment of 
OTEC, the Organization of Tuna Exporting Countries, 
and I now call on our friends in OPEC to come forward 
and help us to understand and obtain fair value from 
our threatened resource and to make tuna fishing 
sustainable. 
 I come now to the economic crisis that my 
country is facing. As a developing nation, we are 
grateful for the grants provided by our allies and 
partners to advance our development. They have been 
helpful. 
 Mr. Martínez Bonilla (El Salvador) Vice-
President, took the Chair. 
 But we must acknowledge that outright grants do 
not always create meaningful employment. Jobs 
created are illusory and temporary. In the absence of a 
strong local economy, our children, our most valuable 
resource, are leaving our shores for opportunities 
elsewhere. The continuing downward cycle created by 
their departure must be stopped, or else it will destroy 
the very fabric of our society. Our allies and partners 
can help us stop this cycle by promoting the 
development of private enterprise through investment 
in our country. We need capital and entrepreneurial 
expertise. 
 I implore our allies and partners to consider 
providing incentives to their nationals to encourage 
them to invest in our islands, to come to our islands 
and launch partnerships with our talented people to 
create a viable economy. Let us once and for all put 
aside the fiction that we need handouts. What we need 
are partners and investment to help advance our 
economy, put an end to the out-migration of our people 
and propel Palau towards economic self-sufficiency. 
 We note with satisfaction the decision by the 
People’s Republic of China to invite Taiwan to attend 
the World Health Assembly. The health and safety of 
the world’s peoples are at the heart of the ideals of the 
United Nations. In order to further promote those 
ideals, we recommend that Taiwan be invited to 
participate meaningfully in the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change coming up 
in Copenhagen and other international organizations 
and forums. 
 We have heard the voices of world leaders from 
countries small and large, powerful and vulnerable. We 
have heard the voice of science. Let us heed those 
voices, fulfil our obligations to our people, now and in 
the next generation, and work for a strong economy 
and a healthy planet."
2988,26,1971,NZL,"164.	 Mr. President, it is a particular pleasure to congratulate the new President of this Assembly. You come to us, Sir, as one of the most distinguished statesmen of South-East Asia, from a great country of that region, and with qualities that will serve us admirably during one of the most important assemblies in the history of this Organization. It is also a pleasure for me to pay a tribute to the previous President of the Assembly, Mr. Hambro of Norway, who presided so well over a session marking another significant juncture in the lifetime of the United Nations.
165.	This session of the General Assembly, meeting under the guidance of an Asian President, is one which will be marked by a degree of preoccupation with matters relating to that most populous of regions which has not always been characteristic of this Organization. For New Zealand, a country of the South Pacific on the fringes of Asia but a full partner, for all that, in many aspects of the increasingly intensive co-operation among the great majority of countries in this region, this will be welcome.
166.	It means that in the first instance the Assembly will, as we hope, at last come to grips in a realistic manner with the position which the People's Republic of China should occupy in the Organization. My Government, along with most of those Governments represented here today, has welcomed the hopeful developments which have taken place in relationships with Peking since the Assembly last met, and particularly during the last few months. The announcement of President Nixon's intention to visit China at some time before May of next year and the preliminary talks which preceded that announcement, no less than the actual visit when it eventuates, have the quality of events which leave their mark on the history of human affairs. They portend the end of an era. Whether it is the beginning of a new order depends on the efforts which will be made by all concerned. For the present we are in a period of transition and of adjustment of relationships which calls for
difficult decisions on the part of Governments, but particularly on the part of those whose future is intimately bound up with the destinies of Asia.
167.	For many years my Government, which in 1961 proposed the inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of an item on the question of the representation of China in the United Nations, has been concerned with the achievement of a solution to the problem of Chinese representation that would be both just and reasonable. We have spoken in favor of the seating in the United Nations of the People's Republic of China. We have also wished to see fair recognition of the reality of the situation, which is the existence of two Governments in full control of their respective territories. Here there is a separation of authority as distinct as there is in the case of what are known as the 'divided States', but with the essential difference that the entity, China, is already a Member of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has argued strongly in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the admission of the divided countries should not be linked to the problems resulting from their division [Aj8401IAdd.l, para. 104]. My delegation may not be entirely convinced that that is so, but since the argument has been advanced, a fortiori it must apply in the case of two Governments, in control for two full decades of different parts of the territory of what was a founding Member of the United Nations. The legitimacy of either Government is not a matter for the Assembly to determine in the circumstances of the case, where both Governments enjoy wide recognition among United Nations Members. It is for the Assembly rather to make clear that a resolution of the basic conflict lies with the parties concerned, while providing for the seating of both in the Organization.
168.	This is fair; this is reasonable; this is, above all, common sense. That is why my Government, which shares with many others the desire to see the representatives of Peking seated in the Assembly and exercising the powers which should fall to them in the Security Council, has joined in sponsoring a proposal to this effect[A/L.633].
169.	Great Powers have great capacity to achieve good, or equally to inflict damage. Rapprochements involving great Powers must always be welcomed for the relaxation of tension which should accompany them. Yet it is important, and it is the responsibility of this Organization to ensure, that the rights of the less powerful should not be ignored or swept away in the interests of an accommodation among super-States, or between a super-State and the rest of the world community. My delegation believes that this consideration is one to which due weight should be given when the Assembly embarks upon the substantive discussion of this problem.
170.	It is, indeed, the peculiar quality of the General Assembly that, as the Secretary-General stated in paragraph 95 of his introduction, it 'offers the smaller and the medium Powers not only a voice, but also a way of influencing the course of events far in excess of what was previously available to them'. This is a significant statement, like a number of others made in this year's
introduction, particularly in part one, to which I wish to pay a warm tribute.
171.	My Government believes that the smaller Powers, into whose ranks we have the pleasure of welcoming Bahrains Bhutan, Qatar and soon Oman, have a special role to play both within the United Nations and outside. They bring a different perspective to world affairs which can serve as a useful balance to the interests of larger Powers,, while in many cases they enjoy relationships with such Powers which enable them both to understand the objectives of the latter and to exercise some influence upon them.
172.	The necessity for this three-way relationship between the great Powers, small countries and international institutions has been dramatically evident in recent weeks in the international monetary situation. It is a fact of life we recognize, that the economic weight of the great industrial Powers has a major impact on molding the character of the international monetary system. In the present unstable situation it is the major Powers that must undergo the restructuring needed to restore equilibrium. Naturally it is those Powers that will have a major role in the negotiations that are necessary to lead to long-term international monetary stability.
173.	At the same time, it is essential that the great Powers recognize that -their economic decisions can profoundly affect the economic stability of the smaller nations, many of which do not have sophisticated monetary systems and the resilience to ride out major upheavals. I repeat what I said at the meetings in Washington last week that it is an unfortunate fact that recent measures taken by major countries which to them seemed reasonable arid legitimate-may have damaging repercussions on the economies of small nations whose problems were neither perceived nor discussed.
174.	New Zealand welcomes the improvement in the climate for constructive discussion. While we understand the reasons for the actions of the United States Administration, we firmly believe that all nations, large and small, that are intimately concerned with these events should consider each other's difficulties. We are confident that they will recognize the duty each has to the international community to reach a reasonable compromise before further serious damage is done not only to international trade but also to the institutions that have served us well since Bretton Woods. We are encouraged, therefore, that the International Monetary Fund unanimously recognized that, whereas the present international monetary situation contains the dangers of instability and disorder in currency and trade relationships, it also offers the opportunity for constructive changes in the international monetary system, and in particular it called upon its members to collaborate with the Fund and with each other in order, as promptly as possible, to establish a satisfactory structure of exchange rates, together with the reduction of restrictive trade and exchange practices.
175.	Among other problems confronting small countries is their position in world trade and in relation to large economic groupings, which may so easily develop marked protectionist characteristics. In this debate last year, the leader of the New Zealand delegation spoke of the threat which hung over New Zealand's economic future as negotiations were engaged on the entry of the United Kingdom, its largest export market, into the European Economic Community [1853rd meeting, para. 197]. He said that in a very real sense the role of regional groupings ia world trade was on trial in this test case. He also said that ft would be tragic if, as a result of enlarging the European Economic Community, one of the world's most efficient agricultural producers were to be driven to the wall.
176.	I owe it to this Assembly , and to the countries of the Community, as well as to the Government of the United Kingdom, to record on this occasion the satisfactory outcome of these negotiations from New Zealand's point of view. Having disposed of this area of uncertainty in its immediate trading future, New Zealand is now in a better position to plan ahead, to move forward on the basis of sound economic growth and to play its full part in world trade and development and, with it, in the Second Development Decade.
177.	Regional economic groupings are a fact of international life. They have much to offer to smaller countries by providing the advantages of a market-place of new dimensions. The development of wider opportunities for trade and development throughout many of the countries and territories of the South Pacific is one of the important goals sought by the Heads of State or Government of Western Samoa, Nauru, Fiji, Tonga and the Cook Islands, who joined with the representatives of Australia and New Zealand in the South Pacific Forum held in Wellington in August this year. A second such meeting will be held in Canberra in the first half of 1972, and preparatory work is under way among officials. Co-operation is envisaged over a wide range of fields of practical interest. Combined with the continuing work of the South Pacific Commission and the welcome and increasing commitment of United Nations agencies to the area, we believe these activities should have a significant impact at the development level.
178.	There was another aspect of the growing sense of South Pacific awareness at the recent meeting. This was the unanimous feeling of concern expressed by this group of small countries that, despite the opposition voiced over the years, they should still be faced with the intrusion, as they saw it, of a great Power into the area for the purpose of conducting atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. Why, they asked, if the hazards are as slight as France claims, should it not test nearer home?
179.	In this and in other ways in recent months a growing impatience has been revealed among countries in and bordering the Pacific. An even wider range of concern has been shown in recent discussions in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the limits of National Jurisdiction. While we welcome the fact that this year's test series has been cut short after five explosions, this is apparently only a temporary relief. What we wait to hear is that this will have been the last series to be conducted in our Pacific area. In saying this, my
delegation is not unmindful of the arguments that France is not a party to the partial test-ban treaty; that it is, after all, only following the path of other nuclear Powers which continue to develop their potential through underground testing; that there is no agreement on measures of nuclear disarmament; and that the People's Republic of China also continues to test in the atmosphere. My delegation will advocate at this session, as it has done in the past, the ending of all nuclear testing, including underground testing. But meanwhile no atmospheric test can escape the condemnation of those who have signed the partial test-ban treaty and who constitute a great majority of this Assembly.
180.	The meeting of the South Pacific Forum to which I have referred brought together all the independent or self-governing countries of the South Pacific. Apart from Australia and New Zealand, none has a population of much more than half a million or a land area greater than 7,000 square miles, and the majority are decidedly smaller. Yet in every case, whether the country concerned had been a Non-Self-Governing or Trust Territory, the right to self-determination had been recognized and freely exercised, and the transition had been a peaceful one in what we like to think is the Pacific way. Nor, so far as New Zealand's remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories of Niue and the Tokelau Islands are concerned, will that right of free choice be denied when the peoples concerned wish to exercise it. The problems which remain, unlike those in some other parts of the world and notably southern Africa, do not relate to this principle: they are simply, in these tiny islands, the problems of size, resources and general viability. It has been a matter of disappointment to my delegation that the bodies concerned with questions of decolonization have not as yet fully studied the special problems inherent in such small Territories. Rather, they have been understandably anxious to assert the basic principles to which my delegation, having voted in favor of resolution 1514 (XV), also subscribes. My delegation has nevertheless been encouraged by the trend of the constructive discussion which took place this year in Sub-Committee II of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.
181.	The Assembly will be interested to know that the New Zealand Government, which has long expressed its willingness in principle to receive a visiting mission, has during this year's consideration of Niue and the Tokelaus, invited the Special Committee to send a small mission to both Territories in 1972. It thus continues a pattern of co-operation with the United Nations in the field of decolonization which at different times has involved United Nations presence both in the former Trust Territory of Western Samoa and in the Cook Islands. It is confident that, when a mission of the Special Committee visits Niue and the Tokelau Islands next year, this will be an important element not only in ascertaining the attitudes of the local populations but also in deepening understanding in the United Nations of the conditions in these small Pacific islands. The Secretary-General has provided an excellent summary of the question in paragraph 304 of his introduction where, speaking of small Territories, he says:
'.,. the problems involved in their decolonization are nevertheless complex and call for individual solutions which must stem from the full and freely expressed wishes of their peoples and, at the same time, take account of realities.'
182.	Once the right to self-determination has been recognized, the search for a realistic solution to the problems of Non-Self-Governing Territories can begin and the United Nations can assist in the process. But there remain those Territories, in particular Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea, in respect of which that right continues to be denied; and in Southern Rhodesia the problem is overlaid with racial discrimination and apartheid-type policies which deprive large segments of the population of their most elementary human rights. Here, as on the even more arduous question of South. Africa itself, the approach in the United Nations must of necessity be a consistent one: no doubt must be left as to where the international community stands on the principles involved, and its condemnation must be firmly stated where these principles are denied.
183.	In determining its position on the various draft resolutions on questions relating to southern Africa which will be before the present session, the New Zealand delegation will wish to give full weight to this moral imperative. It was for this reason that New Zealand recorded an affirmative vote earlier this year in the Economic and Social Council on its resolution 1591 (L) on apartheid, on which it had previously found it necessary to abstain in the voting on draft resolution V in the Commission on Human Rights. It is at the same time impressed by the view expressed by the Secretary-General in the section of his introduction entitled 'Concluding Remarks' where, in the light of his long experience, he states in paragraph 143:
'It is however a weakness when resolutions are adopted which have no prospect of implementation, and the authority and prestige of the world's greatest deliberative body is thereby eroded.'
It will be our endeavor in our discussions with the sponsors of resolutions on this topic and during the formal deliberations on them, to ensure that these wise words are given full weight.
184.	New Zealand's view on the questions of apartheid and raciL? discrimination will be set out more fully under the appropriate items on the agenda. I should wish to place on record during this debate, however, my Government's stated intention to proceed to the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX)J as its major contribution to the International Year. For this purpose, the Government has introduced into the legislature a Race Relations Bill which is currently at the committee stage. We hope it will be enacted in time to allow ratification to take place before the end of this year. Our examination of the situation in New Zealand showed that, in practice as in law, substantial conformity with the provisions of the Convention already exists. A Race Relations Act, which establishes complete legislative compliance with this key international instrument, will nevertheless constitute an important landmark in the evolution of New Zealand's multiracial society, as well as an unequivocal rejection of all doctrines or political systems based on concepts of racial superiority.
185.	Racial discrimination is but one aspect, although a highly important one, of the broader problem of the defense and promotion of human rights. As New Zealand completes two successive terms of membership in the Commission on Human Rights, we can reflect on the gradual but definite progress which has been made. Looking back over the range of human rights instruments which the United Nations has developed over a longer period, we see legitimate grounds for satisfaction with the development of a substantial legal framework in this field. My delegation has considered for some years that what is now required is an institution which can assist in the promotion of human rights in order to enable the Organization and its Members to give effect to the commitments entered into under Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter. The proposed office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is, in the view of my Government, well conceived to meet this need. This office would provide, moreover, the means of exerting a positive influence on human rights questions, free from political considerations. Let us at this session finally come to grips with this issue. Let us discuss amendments to the terms of reference set out in resolution 1237 (XLII) of the Economic and Social Council so as to enable broad agreement to be reached. Let us strive to remove the doubts which a number of delegations have felt about this proposal. Agreement on this issue would represent an important achievement for this session and for the furtherance of respect for human rights everywhere.
186.	A major item involving human rights in the highest degree has not been separately included on the agenda of the present session, although the Secretary-General has dealt with it in cogent and eloquent terms in paragraphs 177 to 191 of the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization. I refer to the situation in East Pakistan.
187.	The upheaval that has taken place there, causing perhaps the largest refugee problem in modern times, cannot simply be ignored by the Assembly. The consequences that continue to flow from that tragedy have been beyond the resources of both India and Pakistan to cope with and still demand urgent international attention. The United Nations has therefore been called upon to assume an important role in focusing attention on the human desperation involved and in co-ordinating and channeling aid to alleviate the distress.
188.	New Zealanders have been concerned most at the human aspects of the problem the bloodshed and suffering and the far-reaching dislocation which the crisis has caused to the livelihood of both India and Pakistan. But we are also increasingly worried about its implications for the peace of the sub-continent. We have some understanding of the intensity of feelings that have led to this situation and that threaten to increase the human misery if a solution is not found soon, and we have some appreciation of the difficulties that have so far prevented a political solution from being achieved.
the problem. The humanitarian aspects were considered on two occasions this year in the Economic and Social Council. New Zealand took a part in having the question raised, because of the responsibility which we felt that body owed to the refugees themselves and to a shocked public opinion throughout the world. Those discussions served to emphasize, however, that in the absence of a durable political settlement very little can be achieved beyond meeting the immediate day-to-day needs of the refugees,
190.	Shortly after the discussion in the Economic and Social Council the Secretary-General drew the attention of members of the Security Council to the situation in East Pakistan and its implications for international peace and security. That action, in our view, was both timely and a proper exercise of the powers of initiative of the Secretary-General. My delegation wishes to pay a tribute to him for having taken this step and for having set forth at length in paragraphs 124 to 137 of his introduction a concept of the role and powers of the Secretary-General which my delegation takes this opportunity to endorse.
191.	In welcoming the Secretary-General's initiative in a public statement, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Sir Keith Holyoake, observed:
'The essential problem of reaching a political settlement in East Pakistan is one that only Pakistan's own leaders can solve.... But if one is to be reached a climate of confidence must be established., and this requires the co-operation of the Government of India. The Governments of India and Pakistan have so far acted with caution and restraint towards each other. Statements are, however, being made by political figures on both sides that cannot but undermine the positions of the two Governments and add to the tensions between them,'
192.	This deteriorating situation was described graphically by the Secretary-General in his message to the President of the Security Council when he said:
'... I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the time is past when the international community can continue to stand by, watching the situation deteriorate and hoping that relief programs, humanitarian efforts and good intentions will be enough to turn the side of human misery and potential disaster'.
193.	A durable solution can be arrived at only by negotiation and compromise between all the parties directly concerned, and not by further assertions of force. Substantial progress towards a settlement has so far not been achieved largely because of the tension that has developed in the area. That tension, in turn, has arisen in part from desperation at the apparent absence of any hopeful sign of a political settlement being reached in consultation with the elected representatives of East Pakistan. This is the crucial problem the Secretary-General was referring to when he spoke of 'a series of vicious circles which largely frustrate the efforts of the authorities concerned and of the international community to deal with the vast humanitarian problems involved'[A/8401/Add.l, para. 184].
189. We have therefore been anxious to see that the United Nations should bring its influence to bear fully on
194. The United Nations has a heavy responsibility for maintaining international peace and security in the area
will not have fulfilled that responsibility simply by attending to the daily physical needs of the refugees, immense though these problems alone have become. As the New Zealand delegation said in the Economic and Social Council on 16 July, 'the dictates of humanitarianism do not cease with the provision of food and shelter. They extend to the long-term future of the unfortunate refugees and particularly their right to return of their own free will to their homes in conditions which promise them a normal life as citizens participating fully in their society.'9 It is in this area of the problem that the United Nations can exercise a beneficial restraining influence, encouraging the leaders on either side to seek an acceptable accommodation and to act out of a sense of broad humanitarian concern for the interests of the refugees themselves, on whom the greatest burden of all has fallen.
195.	I do not wish to labor, in connexion with the question of East Pakistan any more than in relation to the war in Viet-Nam and the widened Indo-China conflict, the failure of the United Nations to play any real part at the political level. The shortcomings of the Organization in the area of peace and security were widely discussed during the twenty-fifth anniversary session. There are a variety of reasons for this state of affairs, residing mainly in the will of Member States to use the Organization and their concept of their interests outside it.
196.	One element, however, which it should lie within cur power in this Assembly to rectify, is the state of the Organization's finances. This problem, arising from its involvement in peace-keeping activities, is intimately related to its future capacity in that area.
197.	We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his frankness in stating that 'there exists no real basis for optimism or for the expectation that an over-all and comprehensive solution is imminent or likely to be found in the foreseeable future' [ibid., para. 119]. I submit, however, that we should nevertheless, during this session, face up to this complex of problems with all the seriousness that we can muster. My delegation, for one, is willing to see negotiations engaged on the basis put forward by the President of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [A/8497], More specifically, New Zealand, as a bond-holder, is prepared to see its bonds included in a negotiated package on the basis of a reduced face value, as well as to see waived such credits as might stand to it in the peace-keeping accounts of the Organization. It is New Zealand's expectation and hope that all other Members will join, in their various ways, in a united effort to save the Organization from the bankruptcy which is so clear and present a danger to it. This is surely a year when the United Nations is at the cross roads of history. Let us equip it for a vigorous future.
198.	I would like to join previous speakers in expressing our very high regard for the Secretary-General, U Thant, as he completes his final term of office. It was indeed a difficult inheritance to which he succeeded many years ago and he has performed with unexampled steadfastness,
9 This statement was made at the 1783rd meeting of the Economic and Social Council, the official records of which are published in summary form.
honor and devotion the essential task of holding this Organization together over the ensuing period. We have all expected much of, as well as imposed much on, our Secretary-GeneraL May I say for New Zealand that our debt of gratitude to him is very high indeed.




"
2996,26,1971,AUS,"38.	  I should like, on behalf of Australia,, to extend my congratulations to Mr. Adam Malik, upon his election as President of the General Assembly, Indonesia and Australia are close, not only geographically, but also in our governmental and personal relationships. We are aware of the courageous and energetic role which the President has played both at the time of Indonesia's independence and since. We value his efforts in fostering the development of a sense of community and a pattern of co-operation in South-East Asia. He will recall our own active co-operation with his initiative in calling together the Djakarta Conference on the question of preserving peace in the Khmer Republic in May 1970.
39.	We welcome the Assembly's decision this year to draw its President from Indonesia. We believe that Mr. Malik especially merited this honor. We have no doubt that he, as President, will uphold the high standards established by his illustrious predecessors, and not least by his immediate predecessor, Ambassador Hambro of Norway, who graced the office of President with such notable distinction throughout the twenty-fifth anniversary year of the United Nations.
40.	We are conscious that this is the last session of the General Assembly that will be graced by the presence of our greatly respected and esteemed Secretary-General. I should like at this time to express my Government's warm regard for UThant and its high appreciation of the dedicated service that he has given to this Organization throughout his 10 years in office.
41.	I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome most warmly Bahirain, Bhutan and Qatar to membership in the United Nations.
42.	Our President assumes the presidency at a time when the problems which face us are especially complex and troublesome. These problems are not made here; and, sadly, acceptable solutions are not found here as often as we could wish. But we believe that, by exercising patience and tolerance and by seeking to find what is in the interests of all, this Assembly can continue to do much towards increasing international understanding.
43.	Because it is of special concern to my country, I should like first of all to speak about the Asian and Pacific region. There are many problems in this area that are new and pressing, and many which, with goodwill and understanding, we might well be able to bring nearer to solution.
44.	It is true that in some parts of South-East Asia today situations of misery and tragedy persist. Fortunately, it is also true that in other parts of the region there exist not only peace and stability but a good prospect that this peace and stability can be preserved, in spite of the threats and challenges which are present. This is so particularly in the case of our nearest neighbors-Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. All are well acquainted with dangers and threats. All have taken, and are taking, imaginative measures to construct political, economic and social defenses not only against those dangers they have known in the past, but also against those which perceptive leaders can foresee for the future.
45.	I referred a moment ago to the r ile of our President in the development of a sense of community in South-East Asia. The Charter itself recognizes the value that may flow from regional arrangements. There are several such arrangements that hold promise. The Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN], for example, has not sought to cut a figure on the world's stage. But it has sought to cut and is cutting a swath through old prejudices and problems in South-East Asia. There is developing in the region a sense of common .interest and a readiness to tackle the region's problems on the basis of that interest, The sense of community being established and the machinery that has been created to service it provide new promise of future stability and progress. Australia is not a member of that Association, but it is a sympathetic and interested observer.
46.	We are ourselves a member of the Asian and Pacific Council [ASPACJ, which is also making a valuable contribution towards neighborly understanding and co-operation. We firmly believe that regional developments of this kind, together with such other organizations and programs as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the Asian Development Bank, the Mekong Valley Scheme and the Colombo Plan for Co-operative Development in South and South-East Asia help to secure peace and to promote prosperity in the area and, indeed, help to strengthen the position of the United Nations. In saying this I have in mind that Asia and the Pacific are of increasing significance to the stability of the whole world order.
47.	It is the great wish of my country to see conditions created that will remove suffering and allow people to progress to better standards of living in greater security. In Asia, as elsewhere, we know how dependent, political and economic stability are upon one another. We are unlikely to achieve stable economic progress in the area while countries are subject to threats and political subversion from outside. We realize, of course, that we cannot effectively advance the welfare of the developing countries unless the world economy as a whole including especially that of the most advanced countries is healthy and dynamic, unless the frontiers of production and trade are constantly moving forward.
48.	In Indo-China the war that has torn the area for so long still continues. There has been some decrease in the scale of fighting, but the earnest desire of the Australian Government-and most other Governments-for a peaceful and just settlement has not yet been realized. The policy of my Government has been to support every initiative genuinely designed to end the destruction and hardship this conflict has caused,
49.	Unhappily, we do not yet have any indication that the leaders of North Viet-Nam are prepared to keep their troops within their own borders and to leave the other countries of Indo-China to determine their own future, and while North Viet-Nam maintains its present policies Australia will continue to give such help as it can to the Governments and peoples of the Republic of Viet-Nam, the Khmer Republic and the Kingdom of Laos in their struggle to survive and to exercise their own choice of their system of government and their way of life. The progress that has been achieved in the security situation of the Republic of Viet-Nam has now enabled the Australian Government to announce that its combat forces will be withdrawn by the end of this year. Our aid program will continue, and we shall continue to support genuine efforts to achieve a just and peaceful settlement.
50.	I want to stress my Government's hope that once a settlement is reached it will prove possible for many nations outside IndO-China to join in a program of reconstruction and development for the war-ravaged peoples of this area, including the people of North Viet-Nam. That is most important. The United Nations, although it has been unable to play any effective peace-keeping role in Indo-China, could then be a major channel for economic and social aid to the area.
51.	As other speakers have mentioned, millions of refugees have in the last few months moved from East Pakistan into India, creating a tragic human problem so vast that no one of us single-handed can deal with the situation. I do not try to canvass the events that have caused this exodus. Views may differ on that subject. We have ourselves regarded the events in East Pakistan as essentially an internal problem to be solved by the Pakistan Government. But the refugees must be cared for and as soon as possible returned to their homes.
52.	Along with many others, the Australian Government and people have already made a contribution to helping the refugees. We shall continue to watch the refugee situation with close concern and to help where we can. But we believe it calls for continuing action by the United Nations with the full backing of its Member States.
53.	May I turn now to the area of the South Pacific. On many islands scattered over d vast expanse of ocean live upwards of 4 million people. Great stretches of sea have divided them and have at the same time and for centuries been the Highroad between them. We perceive in this area a growing sense of community with the modern world and a desire on the part of the peoples of this region to join together to help one another.
54.	Members of the Assembly will be aware that there has been in existence for many years a South Pacific Commission comprising representatives of Governments within, and traditionally involved in, the area. This Commission meets annually to consider ways and means of promoting the economic and social welfare of the island peoples. But perhaps not all members are' ware that the Governments of the South Pacific islands this year took the initiative in meeting, together with Australia and New Zealand, in a new and separate forum to discuss a wider range of common problems, including political issues. It is called the South Pacific Forum. New Zealand acted as host to its first meeting last August. Australia will have the honor of playing host to the second meeting, which is expected to take place early next year.
55.	I mention this development because it furnishes another illustration of regional self-help. Also, I wish to remind Member States that special problems face these countries because of their small size and the vastness of their ocean setting.
56.	It will be difficult for them to cope with these problems alone. Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France and the United States have long been engaged in providing assistance to them, and I believe that will continue. But there is a need for other Members and for the agencies of our Organization, which have indeed already become involved to some degree, to study what further help may be required in the future.
57.	Papua and New Guinea, which Australia continues to administer and in which this Organization has a special interest, as half of it is a Trust Territory, stands between South-East Asia and the South Pacific, The territory is already a member of the South Pacific Commission. When it achieves nationhood it is expected to join the South Pacific Forum.
58.	The Papua and New Guinea House of Assembly has now decided that internal self-government should be attained between 1972 and 1976, if it should be made clear during the elections to the House of Assembly early next year that that is what the people wish. My Government has endorsed that view and has made it clear that after full self-government it will be for the Government of Papua and New Guinea to determine when it wishes to have full independence.
59.	In view of the importance of the 1972 elections, my Government is pleased that the Trusteeship Council has accepted an invitation to send a visiting mission to observe them.
60.	I turn now to the question of China. We believe that there has in recent times been evidence of a change of attitude on the part of the People's Republic of China, and, as the representative of a country whose future is closely associated with the peace and progress of the Asian and Pacific region, I want to reaffirm here that we will welcome the development of a more fruitful relationship between the People's Republic of China and the international community as a whole.
61.	We have ourselves been trying to increase contacts between Australia and the People's Republic of China for many years. For years we have had substantial two-way trade with it and we hope that contacts between our two countries will continue to grow to the enhancement of mutual understanding.
62.	We have welcomed the news of the forthcoming visit to Peking by the President of the United States. We hope that this visit will help to usher in a new era in international relations. 
63.	We want the People's Republic of China to join us here in our efforts to realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Our position on this has been made quite clear. We think the People's Republic of China should be represented in the United Nations. It is also our view that it should occupy a permanent seat in the Security Council. We have joined in co-sponsorship of a draft resolution [A/L.633J, now before the Assembly, which seeks to achieve these two objectives.
64.	In other words, we accept and advocate the acceptance by others of the realities of the China situation. But, of course, one of the realities is that the Republic of China is and has been since the beginning of the Organization a loyal and responsible Member. In our view there should be no question of expelling it.
65.	The claims of the People's Republic of China and of the Republic of China are at present irreconcilable: each claims to be the sole Government of China; each claims jurisdiction over territory that is in fact controlled by the other. So far as de facto control is concerned, the reality is that the People's Republic of China controls the mainland and the Republic of China controls Taiwan. We consider that this reality should be reflected in the decisions of this Organization by providing for the representation of both.
66.	We are conscious of the fact that the Republic of China governs 14.5 million people, more than the population of Australia-and, in terms of population, Australia is by no means one of the smallest Members of this Organization. We believe that any resolution which would result in depriving the Republic of China of representation in the United Nations is an important question under Article 18 of the Charter. We think that all Members, particularly small Members, need to reflect upon this point. In these circumstances, we have ourselves decided to co-sponsor a draft resolution before this Assembly to have such a question declared to be important [A/L.632].
67.	I have spoken earlier on our efforts to assist other countries of the Asian aiid Pacific region, which is one of special concern to us. I do not wish to convey the impression that our efforts are now, or will be in the future, limited to that region. Members will be aware that we have, either directly or in concert with others or working with specialized agencies, tried, according to our ability, to help developing countries in other areas. Indeed, our aid has recently passed the figure of 1 per cent of our gross national product.
68.	We subscribe to the objectives of the Second United Nations Development Decade, which contemplate a reinforcement of our efforts and the accelerated advancement of those who need advancement most. But all- of our accomplishment and our hopes will be placed in jeopardy if we cannot order the world economy so that it operates smoothly and dynamically. I say this because we are now confronted with an economic situation of more gravity than we have known for decades. I do not think that there is any reason to believe that we shall not meet and deal with this situation. But we must approach our problems with care, we need to safeguard those economic blessings we have won with such effort in the past; and we need to use whatever means are available to us, including those within the United Nations system, to bring us through to calmer economic waters.
69.	We all know that the developed countries have found it more difficult in recent years to maintain stability in their domestic economies at the upper level of economic activity. The struggle with inflation has been almost as troublesome as was, in an earlier period, the struggle against deflation. These domestic troubles have inevitably had their impact on international economic relationships. The international currency system has come under strain, and some adjustments may now be needed. The great movement towards liberalization of trade has slowed; some fear that it may be reversed. I believe we have learned too much to permit those fears to be realized, but they should not be ignored. Too much depends on this.
70.	Until we can achieve stability in the domestic economies of the developed countries, the risks of economic distress will be present for all of us. Until we can firmly establish a sound international currency system and a health} and dynamic international trade, both the developed and the developing countries could suffer serious distress. Markets could shrink; capital flows could be reduced; international economic aid, which in some cases has already tended to be reduced, could fall still further.
71.	Perhaps this twenty-sixth session of the Assembly might be an occasion for us to renew, however informally, our will to seek co-operative solutions to the world's economic problems. This does not mean that we should intrude into areas in which other international bodies are energetically engaged in seeking solutions, whether in the field of the currency system or the field of trade. But we should move forward in a practical way in those agencies which operate within the United Nations structure. The Australian delegation hopes that the proposals now before the Assembly to reinvigorate the Economic and Social Council will be accepted. We hope too that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, when it meets in Santiago in April next year, will address itself to major matters that can be classified as ripe for settlement.
72.	I have referred to proposals to reinvigorate the Economic and Social Council. One of those proposals is to establish a new committee on science and technology. We welcome this decision.  At the twenty-fifth session of the Assembly we co-sponsored the draft resolution which became resolution 2658 (XXV), on the role of modern science and technology in development . However, I feel bound to say that we have had some reservations about the way in which many of the United Nations organizations have become separately involved in this field. In general, the machinery seems to have grown up ad hoc rather than in accordance with any considered plan. The result has been a proliferation of committees and organizations with consequential problems of co-ordination. Care will obviously be needed to ensure that any new committee does not become merely an additional element of confusion and complexity, through its own round of meetings, working groups and seminars and its own weight of documentation and increased demands on an already overburdened Secretariat.
73.	The General Assembly is in the midst of preparations for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, to be held in Stockholm next year, which could have far-reaching effects on man's need to use, not to abuse, the natural endowments of this planet. Although Australia is not a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Conference, we have followed, and to the fullest extent possible participated in, the United Nations' work on this subject. We believe there is a need to create greater awareness of our objectives. Given this recognition, it may be possible to devote a greater share of the resources produced by economic policies of growth to our common advantage.
74.	We do not see attempts simply to reverse or slow down the process of economic growth as a particularly constructive or realistic approach. There is an essential need for balance in our approach. Preservation of a benign human environment in all its aspects must be a constant aim. At the same time it should be seen as an essential part of the developmental process, and not as an element inhibiting economic growth.
75.	In my remarks to this Assembly today, I have given some emphasis to matters affecting the region in which we ourselves live. At the same time I am very fully aware of the other great issues that many representatives have raised.
76.	None of us can ignore, for example, the grave situation in the Middle East, which continues to defy solution, or again, the serious problems of southern Africa. We are all too painfully conscious of the lack of progress towards agreement on improving the United Nations machinery for keeping the peace. I have not, in the course of this statement, referred to the complexities of disarmament or to the progress made on the question of the peaceful uses of outer space. The search for comprehensive agreements to define the law of the sea and the use of the resources of the sea-bed could command a whole chapter itself.
77.	Australia is deeply conscious of these other issues. We stand ready to play our part, where it seems there is any useful part for us to play. Finally, I take the opportunity to affirm this belief: that, with all the limitations which time and circumstances have revealed, the United Nations still remains the best repository so far devised of the finest
hopes and aspirations of mankind.





"
3043,31,1976,AUS,"Mr. President, the Government of Australia warmly congratulates you upon your election to the presidency of this session of our Assembly. Your charm, your manifest international experience, your innovative skill and sage judgment, all combine to make you a welcome and popular holder of the highest office of what we all hope will be a constructive and fruitful session of the General Assembly.
156.	Your country and mine, Mr. President, have for long been associated in the Commonwealth-a concept and a structure which have much to contribute to this Organization.
157.	We have welcomed to membership in the United Nations at this session another Commonwealth country, the Republic of Seychelles. This brings us closer to our goal of universality. Australia has been glad to see growing contact between the United Nations and the Commonwealth Secretariat; and we heartily endorse the proposal, which is being made to this Assembly, that the Commonwealth Secretariat should be given observer status [A/31/191].
158.	Our relationship with the United Nations is a relationship not only with its Members but with its staff. That staff, is led by our Secretary-General, and I should like today to express our appreciation for his outstanding service to the United Nations.
159.	The Government of which I am a member came to office in December last year. This is our first opportunity to reaffirm in this meeting-place of nations the dedication of Australia to the principles and purposes of the United Nations and to their implementation. We remain resolved to contribute in every way we can to the work of this Organization.
160.	As a new Government, naturally we have had to make our own assessment of the international scene, including the role of the United Nations. The international system has entered a period of profound change, and some of the key assumptions of recent decades no longer hold true. Some of the issues which have dominated events are now receding, while new ones are crowding on to the international agenda. Structures, as well as attitudes and values, are changing. The distinction between the political and the economic aspects of international politics is being rapidly narrowed. If these multiple changes are not to constitute a multiple crisis, they require a constructive, co-operative and imaginative response on the part of us all-a response which thinks in terms strategically and of decades, rather than tactically and in terms of instant solutions.
161.	The Australian Government believes that the United Nations can and should play a key role in shaping this response. Its future importance will depend on how it meets this challenge. Because of this, we believe that now is a time when all of us could well consider how the Organization's great potential can be more fully realized. If we are to construct a new international order-and the magnitude of the changes confronting us suggests that nothing less is required-then a realistic reappraisal of the tasks and methods of the United Nations is surely timely in order to ensure that it makes the fullest contribution.
162.	In this respect, we believe that one important requirement is that the General Assembly should shape concepts and establish priorities and principles which are relevant to its changing environment. Only then will it be able to concentrate its energies and resources where they are most needed and where they can be most effective. Unless we have a clear sense of which issues have priority and which issues can be realistically tackled with a hope of success, those energies and resources will be largely wasted.
163.	We also believe that the United Nations will only make its full contribution at this critical time if its Members recognize that one of the principal sources of its strength lies in its moral authority. This in turn derives from the fact that it expresses -however imperfectly- some of the deepest, most fundamental aspirations of mankind.
164.	It is this moral authority which constitutes the vital capital of the Organization and which gives it a purchase on events. Deprived of that authority it will become little more than an empty structure of institutional arrangements and procedures that governments can ignore with impunity. It is crucial, therefore, that it should not be deprived of that authority. Ultimately the. case against arbitrary, unrealistic or discriminatory action within the framework of the United Nations rests on this. It can be stated not in terms of duty or obligation, but of good sense and foresight. As Members of the United Nations, we have an interest in maintaining its moral authority and rejecting courses of action inconsistent with it, because otherwise we shall destroy the effectiveness of the very instrument in which we have declared our faith.
165.	Let me stress that none of these observations means that the Australian Government does not understand or sympathize with the desperate human problems and urgent needs which frequently underlie the actions of Members within this Assembly. On the contrary, it is precisely because we consider the solution of these problems to be so important, because we believe that far-reaching changes are required, and because we wish to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations role in that process of change, that we are concerned to make these points.
166.	In the context of structural changes and the emergence of a new international order to which I have referred, primacy must be accorded to economic questions. The complex problems posed by global shortages of food and energy, the population explosion, the gap between rich and poor countries, inflation and the recession in world trade, are major sources of tension, They present the developed and developing worlds with a crucial challenge in international co-operation.
167.	I was forcibly impressed at the fourth session of UNCTAD in Nairobi by the growing anxiety of developing countries that greater progress should be made towards the realization of the new international economic order. My Government recognizes the aspirations of these countries. We shall contribute willingly to the building of a stable and just international structure and we shall work for changes in the world's economic system that are practicable and viable. We believe that a satisfactory new order can be evolved only if the path is planned and realistic. To this end we must all work together through consultation and co-operation. Developed countries should stand ready collectively to subordinate some short-term economic advantages to the overriding longer-term advantage of creating and maintaining a viable international order. Australia is ready to play its part in this process. An order in which poverty, hunger and disease on a massive scale threaten the peace of regions, cannot be endured.
168.	The obligations which we are willing to assume complement the enormous efforts which developing countries themselves undertake. My Government has followed with interest the attempts by developing countries to stimulate greater economic and technical co-operation among themselves. This field has barely been touched. When tilled, it is bound to be productive. A good example is the effective work of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. 
169.	Australia agrees on the need for improvement in the conditions of world commodity trade and recognizes that a concerted effort is necessary for progress to be made in this area. The program of negotiations agreed to at the fourth session of UNCTAD represents a significant advance towards the resolution of the traditional problems which affect international trade in commodities of concern to developing countries. To ensure the success of these negotiations all countries must make a realistic assessment of what can be achieved before the end of 1978. Negotiated solutions must take account of all aspects of the trade and production of particular commodities, of the interests of both consumers and producers, and must be both comprehensive and equitable. Our approach to individual commodity arrangements must be flexible if we are to establish efficient mechanisms for the stabilization of commodity trade.
170.	The Conference on International Economic Co-operation represents a major initiative in international relations which has Australia's strong support. Australia will continue to work - that Conference as well as else- where-towards the evolution, by co-operative means, of a sound basis for future international economic progress.
171.	Australia, as a significant trading nation, has also emphasized the importance of the sound recovery of the world economy and the growth of world trade as important determinants in improving the economic and social prospects of developing countries.
172.	The problem of food is a particularly vital one in a world whose population is increasing so rapidly. While there has been an improvement in food production, the situation for many developing countries remains insecure. It is unacceptable that chronic starvation and malnutrition should persist in a world which has the capacity to produce enough food. We have yet to devise machinery to ensure that each human being is adequately fed. Australia supports efforts which would lead to the establishment of an effective international system of food security.
173.	External assistance can be a valuable complement to the efforts of the developing countries to achieve self- sustaining economic growth. Australian aid is provided in response to requests from developing countries, in accordance with their priorities and within the limits of Australia's own financial and technical capacities. In the fiscal year 1976/1977 Australia's development assistance-which continues to be overwhelmingly in the form of grants, not loans-will total just under $US 500 million: an increase of 15 per cent over that of the past year. We shall, of course, continue and seek to extend this aid effort; but we shall do so fully recognizing that aid is ultimately no substitute for the structural changes which will in fact render aid largely unnecessary and that the best and most acceptable aid is that which eliminates the need for its own continuation.
174.	I turn now to the problems of southern Africa, on which the attention of the international community is centered as never before.
175.	The United Nations has played a crucial role in keeping before us the plight of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and has reminded each of us of our obligation to work for an early end to minority rule.
176.	The Australian Government regards the dramatic development in relation to Southern Rhodesia during the last week as most significant and hopeful. The likelihood of achieving majority rule quickly and without bloodshed is now real. On behalf of my Government, I congratulate the
(many parties which have contributed to this break-through and hope that it' will receive the widest support in this Assembly. We can appreciate the reasons for the reservations and caution with which some approach these proposals for a peaceful settlement, but we sincerely hope that a concern for absolute certainty where, in the nature of things, certainty is not possible, will not result in a failure to grasp an opportunity which the United Nations has been seeking for so long and which even a few months ago seemed unattainable. It will be a tragedy if a demand for a perfect, fool-proof solution becomes the enemy of the best available one. We urge all parties to give these proposals every possible opportunity to work.
177.	Australia views with concern the Republic of South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia. This concern has been demonstrated by our active participation in the work of the United Nations Council for Namibia. A constitutional settlement must be achieved peacefully and must involve SWAPO.
178.	We have also watched with increasing concern events in South Africa itself over the past year. We deplore the racial violence in South Africa, which is the inevitable result of policies based on inequality between peoples. The system of apartheid and the exploitation of one race, by another are abhorrent to us. Ultimately the iniquity of apartheid must be seen and the policy abandoned. Unless there are genuine and urgent moves made to redress the well-founded black African grievances in South Africa, there can be little hope for the abatement of violence there,
179.	However, our concern for the assertion of the protection of fundamental human rights is not limited to the rights of those who live in southern Africa-though we recognize that their plight is perhaps the most urgent facing us at this moment. We see importance, too, in the more general reassertion of the cause of freedom of the individual and the elimination of the indignities which man still heaps upon man: torture, forced labor, discrimination and inequality, to mention but a few. When these are associated with racism the evil is compounded, but we should never forget that they are evil in themselves and must be condemned and opposed wherever they occur.
180.	Terrorism is a subject which involves fundamental issues of human rights. Regardless of the justification that its proponents advance for it, it remains a completely unacceptable form of political pressure. It is unacceptable because it is barbarous and haphazard. It undermines the general fabric of lawful and decent behavior. Those who pursue it deliberately and flagrantly violate the right to life, liberty and protection from injury of those who are made the innocent victims of their pressures. We condemn terrorism and will join in efforts to eliminate it. Nothing would be more certain to destroy that moral authority of which I have earlier spoken than a failure to do so. We can surely muster the will and the resources to deal with this repulsive crime. We welcome the initiative of the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany in bringing before the General Assembly a draft convention on the taking of hostages [see A/31/242].
181.	I turn now to peace keeping and disarmament, both matters of deep concern as change produces new strains and tensions within the international system. Despite the failures of our Organization to do all that is expected of it in the maintenance of peace and security, it has had real successes in its peace-keeping operations. These are supported at present by some 9,000 men in the five current operations. Australia has made a contribution to these activities.
182.	I have spoken of some of the successes of the United Nations, limited though they are, in peace-keeping. This leads to consideration of the wider goal of reduction or control of conventional and nuclear armaments. This is an urgent matter and, if success is not achieved soon, it may not be achieved at all. If we fail the prospects for a viable international order in the last quarter of this century will be bleak.
183.	Three central and fundamental areas where Australia looks and hopes for early progress are: first, the strengthening of measures to .prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons; secondly, the termination of nuclear-weapons testing in all environments; and, thirdly, further progress in strategic arms limitation agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union.
184.	We are concerned not only to see the trend towards universal acceptance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] maintained but also to ensure that all its provisions are carried out. Those nuclear-weapon Powers which are parties to the Treaty have obligations to reduce their arsenals. Other nuclear States must ratify the Treaty and accept the same obligations; and the international community as a whole must accept the application of adequate safeguards on the peaceful uses of nuclear materials in order to prevent their diversion to non-peaceful uses. Increased attention to safeguards and further multilateral efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime will receive our support.
185.	Australia believes that nuclear-weapons testing in all environments should be terminated. Recognizing that this objective will be difficult to achieve, we welcome the study to be made, under the auspices of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, by a group of government experts to investigate international co-operative efforts for the detection and identification of nuclear explosions. We hope that these activities will help to establish a climate conducive to the negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
186.	Australia considers that the limitation of existing nuclear arsenals depends essentially on continued progress in strategic arms limitation negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. We look to an early conclusion of an agreement at the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between those two countries and to further agreements placing restraints on nuclear armaments.
187.	One of the principal activities of the United Nations family is the preparation of multilateral treaties. It is an integral part of the vital and dynamic role which inter-national organizations play today.
188.	The importance of the legislative function is nowhere better evidenced than in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This is the largest single legislative project which the international community has ever undertaken. It is essential that it should not fail, especially as its implications for the restructuring of the international economic order are profound.
189.	My Government is fully committed to the achievement of a just and equitable convention on the law of the sea. But, although we recognize the complexities of the issues involved, we were disappointed at the slow progress made at the recent fifth session of the Conference. We consider it essential that the negotiating momentum be maintained during the intersessional period so that delegations can come to the sixth session in New York in May next year with the feeling that agreement is within reach. My Government will play its part in the process of negotiations and consultations to find solutions to out-standing problems.
190.	A loss of will or lack of resolve now could put at risk the Herculean efforts of the last few years and usher in an era of uncertainty and difficulty, as nations may feel compelled to take unilateral action to preserve important economic interests. Success, on the other hand, will set an example and encourage a climate of optimism which will be of immense value in encouraging further co-operation in international legislation. 
191.	The difficulties which we are experiencing in the Conference on the Law of the Sea reflect a broader problem of which we ought to take note. Last year we suggested in the Sixth Committee during the debate on the report of the International Law Commission  that the time was ripe for the United Nations to review the process by which the international community legislates. The ways in which we approach multilateral treaty-making are varied, chancy, frequently experimental and often inefficient. They place great burdens upon the Governments of Member States; especially upon the developing countries, and it is open to question whether the community could not find more economical and efficient methods of drafting conventions.
192.	In closing I return again to the theme I developed earlier. If I may restate it briefly, we believe that, in a world which is changing rapidly and profoundly and which must restructure its political and economic priorities and mechanisms to meet these changes, the United Nations has a crucial role to play. We believe that it will play that role effectively only if we its Members exhibit the moderation, the sense of priorities and the realism commensurate with the gravity of the problems. We recognize, of course, that the United Nations is essentially a political body and that it will act in political terms. Our concern is that in doing so it should show a sense of practicality and restraint which reflect an awareness both of the realities of the wider international scene and of its own character. If the United Nations fails in these respects, it will strengthen the forces of cynicism and pessimism and damage its own integrity and effectiveness. If it succeeds, it will immeasurably strengthen that moral authority which provides its unique character and which is the true source of its effectiveness.
"
3048,31,1976,PNG,"At the outset I wish to congratulate Mr. Amerasinghe on his election to his most highly respected post as President of the General Assembly. I know that there are heavy responsibilities ahead of him in the coming weeks. Our delegation has the utmost confidence in his capabilities, and I trust that under his able leadership this session will be a success.
111.	On the occasion of Papua New Guinea's admission to this Organization in October of 1975, our Prime Minister, Mr. Somare, stated that our Government's first priority is the welfare of our own people. This is still valid today. We wish to advance in conditions of peace and security and 
realize that to achieve this we must make our presence known in world affairs.
112.	We are committed to the increasing interdependence of all Members of this family of nations and see this Organization and its subsidiary and affiliated organizations as the main hope for the third world. In this context we wish to welcome the new Members to the United Nations and in particular the Republic of Seychelles. It is also Papua New Guinea's hope that Viet Nam and Angola will be given favorable consideration on their application for membership.
113.	This is the second time that Papua New Guinea has taken its place in this Assembly. We are proud to have come through our first year of independence. We are also proud that we came through it so well and that we are able to report to this world forum that we have maintained the impetus towards development and social justice set in motion before our independence. We have maintained and developed the trust which was handed to us by the Trusteeship Council.
114.	The first year of the operation of Papua New Guinea's independent foreign policy has justified our faith in choosing what we call the “universalist” path.
115.	“Universalism” as practiced by Papua New Guinea is not widely understood by our friends. It is often confused with 'non-alignment', which it certainly resembles, but the two concepts differ in many important areas. “Universalism” to Papua New Guinea means taking the middle path without veering to either side on questions relating to political ideologies, creeds or governmental systems. We see it as a balanced policy with which Papua New Guinea will make no enemies. But it does not mean just sitting on the fence. It is an active and positive policy. Papua New Guinea has recognized and entered into diplomatic relations with all the large Powers of the world on an equal basis. We are happy to have entered into diplomatic relations with countries having varied forms of governmental systems and geographical location. We have recognized and entered into relations with both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on an entirely even-handed basis.
116.	The one area in which the Papua New Guinea Government does not intend to pursue universalism is in respect to regimes which pursue apartheid or racialist* policies which are unacceptable to us. The Papua New Guinea Government has not and will not recognize, or have any dealings whatever with, countries which practise these policies. We endorse the work of the decolonization Committee2 in seeking self-determination for all peoples in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.
117.	I have mentioned before that Papua New Guinea has recognized both the North Korean and South Korean Governments. We desire most earnestly, for the sake of the future security of the region in which we live, that these two Governments should commence a dialogue between
 
themselves which will result in a peaceful solution to the present uneasy situation. We would, further, wish to see both those Governments represented in the United Nations as equal sovereign States.
118.	Papua New Guinea .is geographically very near to the island of Timor, which has seen some most unfortunate incidents during the course of this year. As a close neighbor we have been most concerned by these incidents and have watched them closely. We advocated for Timor a period of decolonization under the United Nations. But Papua New Guinea is a very small and new actor on the world stage, and it was clear from the outset that there was not any way in which Papua New Guinea could influence the events on Timor in one way or another. Papua New Guinea therefore has not played any active role in . the settlement of the Timor situation. We hope, however, that the people of Timor will be assured their rights and freedoms as outlined in the United Nations Charter.
119.	Papua New Guinea has watched from afar the
problems of the Middle East. We wish to commend the work of the United Nations in moving towards a peaceful solution.
120.	I have already mentioned that the Government of Papua New Guinea considers its first priority to be the welfare of its own people at home. Papua New Guinea has only achieved a very low level of industrial development. Its export income is derived mainly from the sale of primary products. The nature of our economy is such that sharp changes in world market prices have very important implications for economic planning in our country. We know that we are not unique and that other countries are also experiencing the ill-effects of the current world recession. I feel confident in saying that the effects are felt more acutely by those of us in the third world who are heavily dependent on earnings from the sale of primary products. It is in this context that the Government of Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of the Secretary- General of UNCTAD to bring about a significant change in the existing world economic order.
121.	The fourth session of UNCTAD, recently held in Nairobi, marks the opening of a new and vitally important chapter in relations between the economically advantaged and the economically disadvantaged countries. Proposals put forward have far-reaching implications for all third- world countries. Papua New Guinea, as an island developing country, applauds the special recognition given to the problems of least-developed, land-locked and island developing countries. We welcome and endorse resolution 96 (IV) adopted at Nairobi relating to the expansion and diversification of exports of manufactures and semi-manufactures of developing countries, and resolution 93 (IV) on the integrated program for commodities.  However, caution needs to be voiced. We sincerely hope that time does not bear witness to the fact that file programs were too ambitious and as a result stalled under their own weight. 
122.	Another instance of international co-operation that is of particular concern to Papua New Guinea is the attempt now being made by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to grapple with the still unresolved questions that have been entrusted to it. We feel growing anxiety at the failure so far of the Conference to reach a conclusion. Papua New Guinea has been actively participating in that Conference, and remains fully committed to the goal of a generally accepted treaty.
123.	However we have noted that in the absence of a treaty it is inevitably the stronger nations that are able to take the initiative in developing State practice in this field. In these circumstances smaller nations like Papua New Guinea in protecting their interests have no alternative but to seek such security as may be found in regional arrangements. There is no question, however, that this is our second preference. It is a poorer alternative, both for ourselves and for mankind. No one can contemplate the possible failure of the Conference without being filled with despondency for the future of all who might be affected by the use of the oceans, which include all nations represented at this Assembly.
124.	Finally, I again reiterate my Government's commitment to the maintenance of peace throughout our region and the world. My Government is deeply committed to a nuclear-free zone in the Pacific and supports the other Pacific countries in calling for such a declaration. My Government commends the work of this Organization, its subsidiaries and affiliated organizations in upholding the principles as expounded in the Charter.
"
3148,31,1976,NZL,"Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to congratulate you on your election as President of this Assembly session. This has been a great year for you. You have already demonstrated your presidential capacity in five sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, and at two of them this year. At the same time your country has been the host for a summit meeting of the non-aligned countries in Colombo.1 Your election as President not only ensures that this session will run with unusual punctuality and efficiency, but also reflects honor on Sri Lanka and on the Asian countries which showed their wisdom in selecting you for this high post.
31.	I offer my warm felicitations to our Secretary-General and his staff on their untiring efforts in the interests of all mankind.
32.	New Zealand, as a fellow member of the Common-wealth, gives a special welcome to Seychelles as the newest Member of the United Nations. In accordance with the principle of universality, New Zealand will support the admission of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam when it comes before this Assembly.
33.	The General Assembly is the great key forum for the discussion of world issues, and the attendance of so many distinguished political figures at this session proves this.
34.	Some might think that New Zealand is not well placed to be much more than an onlooker in such a discussion. We are tucked away at the south end of the world. We are small; we are isolated; we are rather out of the way. But I assure you that any such assumption would be wrong. In spite of our geographical position, we are very much a part of the world. We depend for our livelihood, as much as any other country in the world, on our overseas trade.
35.	When things go wrong with other parts of the world, particularly in the economic sphere, we feel the effects and we feel them heavily and badly. As a result of the recent international recession our economic fortunes have suffered a significant downturn. We are still struggling to put things right, and I am not being pessimistic when I say that we still have a long way to go. Times are difficult for New Zealand. Unemployment has increased, and belts have had to be tightened. All this has inevitably placed strains on our society.
36.	But although we are going through a lean time I have no apprehension about our future. This is because our society is fundamentally strong, and it is strong because it is fundamentally just.
37.	We are multiracial society. We are British, we are Maori, we are Polynesian, we are Chinese, we are Danish, Yugoslav, Indian, Dutch and of many other nationalities. Some might see this cultural diversity as a liability or as a source of friction. We do not. It is a strength. We believe that our society is more mature, more accommodating and richer because we have learned and are still learning to get along together. I will not pretend that stresses do not occasionally arise. The movement in recent years of large numbers of our Maori people to the cities and the immigration of other Polynesians from the Pacific Islands have created problems of adjustment that did not formerly exist. The change from a traditional community life in comparatively isolated rural or island areas to a somewhat frustrating and perplexing one in what may seem to many to be an uncaring city is never easy.
38.	I would claim, however, that the change is perhaps easier to make in New Zealand than in many other places throughout the world, and I believe that is because we have a stronger egalitarian tradition and because we believe that human rights are not the preserve of any one group. Divisions of class, status or cultural background are of less significance than they are perhaps anywhere else in the world. I know that is a bold statement to make, but I believe it to be true. To put it into our colloquial terms, we believe in giving the other chap & 'fair go', and it does not matter whether the other chap is a Maori, a Samoan, an Indian, a European, or whatever. We all share the same rights and the same responsibilities.
39.	And this approach is well reflected throughout our history. Representatives might be interested to know that our indigenous people, the Maori, were granted the democratic right of universal suffrage -the 'one man, one vote' that we hear so much of today-in 1867: over a hundred years ago. At that time the rest of the New Zealand community still had to have property qualifications in order to vote. The most reliable test of racial harmony is often claimed to lie in the rate of intermarriage between different groups. In New Zealand the rate of intermarriage is so high that it has been estimated that within a generation or two every New Zealander of British or European stock will have at least one close relative of Maori or Polynesian extraction.
40.	As New Zealanders, we have thus come to see clearly that our separate destiny as a nation lies in building upon the heritage of our two main cultures-that of the Polynesian and that of what we call the Pakeha, or European. What we are striving to do is to leave to our children and their children the inheritance of the best of what is to be found in the traditional values of our different cultures.
41.	This has necessarily meant coming to terms with New Zealand's geographical position. As I mentioned earlier, we are located in the far South Pacific, and so New Zealanders of all races have developed a sense of belonging to the Pacific. It is not for us an area that we look on from a long distance and with detachment, as it will be looked on by most people of the world. It is our region.
42.	Our acceptance of this identify has been accelerated by the emergence of new island nations in our neighborhood, and when I talk of 'neighborhood' it is pretty vast: I am talking of an area of 2,000 to 4,000 miles wide. It has been fostered, too, by the experience we have had in administering our former Territories, the Cook Islands and Niue. The United Nations was closely associated with the process by which those Territories came to self-government, and New Zealand assisted and welcomed that association.
43.	We were pleased, earlier this year, that a Visiting Mission from the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was able to go to our remaining island Territory, which used to be called the Tokelau Islands, but is from now on to be known simply as Tokelau, to discuss its future. The Mission has since submitted its report [A/31/ 23/Rev.l, chap. XVII, annex]. We in New Zealand are giving most serious consideration to what the report has to say and, of course, particularly to its recommendations. Tokelau comprises an isolated, tiny and thinly settled group of islands. My Government will cp-operate fully with the United Nations in finding ways to meet the expressed wishes of the Tokelau people regarding their future.
44.	The process of political change is at work, not only in New Zealand's corner of the Pacific, but in other parts as well. The South Pacific has sometimes been called a quiet backwater. I doubt that that has ever really been true, and certainly in my long experience the South Pacific has always been a busy place; there is always something going on and some changes taking place.
45.	Yet I also believe it is true that the South Pacific is indeed entering upon a new era: new forms of political co-operation are evolving, notably the South Pacific Forum, in which the heads of government of the independent nations of the South Pacific meet at least once each year, with committees in between times. I had the very great privilege of presiding over the first Forum, which was held in New Zealand in 1971. There is a growing sense of collective interest evident in the work of that Forum. Perhaps the best example of this is the concerted approach its members have adopted towards those aspects of the negotiations on the law of the sea which have very great implications for all those who live in our region.
46.	New leaders have emerged and are emerging. They have new ideas and they are determined to give expression to the expectations of their people. This is a good thing, something to be encouraged. Because of the kinship link New Zealand has with the Pacific people, we are that much more aware of their aspirations for advancement and their aspirations for higher living standards. We are also aware- keenly aware-of the expectations that New Zealand and Australia inspire because we are of the relatively more affluent members of the Pacific family.
47.	My Government is committed to assisting the island countries of the Pacific, and this year a greater share than ever before of New Zealand's aid program is going into the South Pacific countries. A special effort is being made to promote employment opportunities in those countries. We will, however, continue to leave it to those countries themselves to decide their own priorities and the direction in which they wish to go in building towards self- sufficiency.
48.	We are doing all that we can to help. We look also to the United Nations and the specialized agencies to continue their good work in our region. The United Nations Development Program [UNDP], we know, faces a grave resources problem. It has, however, made a valuable contribution to the South Pacific in recent years, and this is an opportunity for me to reinforce the previous representations that the New Zealand Government has made, that the UNDP should maintain its support for the important key projects it has been involved in in the region.
49.	There has recently been a quickening of outside interest in this region. To the extent that it reflects a genuine concern to promote the well-being of the developing countries of the South Pacific, it will be welcome.
50.	Having a special interest in the South Pacific does not mean that we take a parochial view of world economic problems. The same egalitarian tradition which I mentioned earlier, the same concern for the basic human rights, leads us to attach great urgency to early progress in restructuring the world's economic and trading system along more equitable lines. We share Secretary-General Waldheim's own blunt assessment when he said: 'A world economically divided could not and would not be politically stable.'
51.	As a country heavily dependent on the export of a narrow range of agricultural commodities, New Zealand knows at first hand the difficulties and uncertainties faced by developing countries whose economic progress is dependent upon a stable and remunerative trade in commodities, mainly primary commodities. I have mentioned our own problems arising from the international recession. But we realize fully that many developing countries were hit even harder than we were, and that for them export earnings have shrunk to a level at which their development efforts have been crippled. We believe that improved commodity training arrangements are an essential ingredient of any new international economic order worthy of that name.
52.	Again, as a net importer of investment capital and technology, New Zealand has a special appreciation of the requirement for better and more equitable international arrangements in those two areas. My Government also believes that the daunting debt-servicing problems currently faced by the poorer developing countries demand immediate attention, and in the future the question of the terms of development assistance generally must receive continuing international consideration in a multilateral context.
53.	There has been some progress since the encouraging conclusion of last year's seventh special session of the General Assembly. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation in Paris and other important meetings, both within and outside the United Nations system, have provided an important element of continuity in the global consultations. The number and the intensity of these meetings reflects a growing recognition of the interrelated nature of our problems and the urgency with which we must tackle them.
54.	The fourth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] succeeded in establishing a framework and a time seals for consideration of the key question of the international commodity trade. It cleared the way, at least, for a more detailed analysis of the specific issues involved. These are welcome developments, although less progress was made in other key areas. But in the new climate, consideration of these issues will not be allowed to lapse; the debate is, fortunately, now a continuing one.
55.	International efforts are focused on many different problems-food production, human settlements, the commodities trade, the transfer of science and technology, the flow of development assistance and investment capital, and the restructuring of the United Nations system itself to make it more responsive to the current needs of the world community. In all these efforts New Zealand is committed to full and constructive participation.
56.	One of this Organization's real achievements in its 30-year history has been in the elaboration of standards for basic human rights. We know, however, that despite those standards and despite all the efforts made by men of good will, people in many parts of the world are still being denied their basic human rights. We know, too, that nowhere is the denial as blatant as it is in the countries of southern Africa. The refusal of those who rule South Africa, Namibia and Rhodesia to accept the principle of human equality has caused acute tensions and has brought the situation in the area to a critical stage. Watching the developments of the last few months, we in New Zealand, like people I know in other countries, have had the feeling that we may be seeing the beginning of a maelstrom of violence.
57.	For Rhodesia, time is rapidly running out. Until recently the Smith regime seemed determined to make no concessions to the demand for early majority rule. It has seemed more and more likely that that objective would be achieved only by armed force, with much bloodshed. My Government is, therefore, very encouraged by the decision of Mr. Ian Smith and his colleagues, belated though it may be, to accept majority rule within two years. So the way is now open for negotiations on the detailed arrangements for the transfer of power, and we in New Zealand earnestly hope that, through British good offices, these can soon begin and that they will be successful.
58.	When the Security Council imposed mandatory sanctions on Rhodesia in 1968,  the Government of which I was then head immediately put them into effect in New Zealand. Since then, successive Governments have applied the sanctions consistently and rigorously. After Mozambique had announce d its decision to apply sanctions, and in view of the consequent loss to it, my Government agreed to contribute to the programs of assistance to that country launched by the Commonwealth Secretary-General and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Although New Zealand is not directly involved, we are prepared to play our part in any international effort to end the bloodshed and to help die people of Rhodesia to achieve a just multiracial society.
59.	Namibia, too, seems dangerously close to the brink of conflict. We in New Zealand believe that South Africa was wrong to go on occupying Namibia after its Mandate was withdrawn, and we have said so consistently. South Africa was even more wrong to try to impose its own policy of apartheid on the people of Namibia. We welcome South Africa's recent acceptance of the goal of independence for Namibia. But independence is meaningless unless it is genuinely based on self-determination. And the refusal of the South African Government to deal with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] has created a justifiable and reasonable doubt in the minds of African and other countries whether the act of self-determination envisaged by that Government will be fully genuine.
60.	As Namibia was once a League of Nations Mandate, this Organization has a special responsibility towards it: its responsibility is to see that all the people of Namibia are given the opportunity to decide freely for themselves what the future of their country should be. It is essential, therefore, that the United Nations should be given the opportunity and the means to supervise free elections in Namibia and to approve any new constitution for that country.
61.	Much is at stake in Rhodesia and in Namibia, but in the longer term the greatest potential for disaster is in South Africa itself. I think this is obvious to all men. South Africa is not in any means the only country in the world where human rights are consistently violated, and we all know this. But it is the only country where racial discrimination is the basis of the whole social, economic and political system. Our own experience in New Zealand has taught us that racial harmony is essential to the well-being of a multiracial society. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr: MuldOon, said in a speech about a month ago:
'The New Zealand Government's attitude to apartheid is very clear: we believe it is wrong and we want to see it ended. It should now be plain even to South Africans that apartheid will not work. Based as it is on racial discrimination, it is an unjust and inhuman system. It can be maintained only by the ruthless use of force, and it cannot be maintained that way indefinitely.'
62.	The rioting that has been going on around South African cities for over three months now began as a spontaneous explosion of black anger. By ruthless repression, the South African authorities have managed to confine it largely to the black townships. They have not been able to stop it. The outside .world can see that they are in a blind alley. Only a fundamental change of direction can prevent an inevitable escalation of the hatred, violence and bloodshed.
63.	Setting up what are called 'homelands', or 'bantustans', for. the African people of South Africa will not solve the problem. The black and colored people of South Africa cannot accept being deprived of citizenship in their own country-the country of their birth and the country they have helped to develop. They must be accepted as citizens of South Africa, entitled to a fair share in South Africa's resources. We note that many countries including in particular Britain and the other members of the European Community, have made it clear that they are unable to extend recognition to the Transkei and other homelands as sovereign, independent States:
64.	New Zealand's position is the same. Indeed, I recall that in 1971 New Zealand voted for the resolution adopted by the Assembly condemning the establishment of the bantustans [resolution 2775 E (XXVI)]. Then, as now, a National Party Government was in office in New Zealand. In 1975 New Zealand also supported the Assembly resolution calling upon Governments not to recognize any of the bantustans [resolution 3411D (XXX)]. That action was taken by a Labor Government, but it was in accordance with the policy that the previous Government had initiated. There is a consistent line of policy in New Zealand on this question.
65.	We note with regret that, 31 years after the United Nations Charter was signed, threats to the peace continue to exist in many parts of the world: notably in the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East. Good sense has prevailed here, and we are not going to have another sterile confrontation over Korea at this session, but the fact remains that the border between North and South Korea remains in a state of continuous tension and that talks between the two Governments have reached an apparent stalemate. As a result, Korea remains divided and outside the United Nations.
66.	We feel deeply for the people of Lebanon in the tragic situation in which they find themselves, a situation not of their own choice or of their own making. We are equally concerned at the lack of progress towards a solution of the Cyprus problem, despite the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and others. Again, it is the people of Cyprus who are the innocent victims. We can only join with others in saying that what is needed is simply the implementation of previous Assembly resolutions: the withdrawal of foreign troops, the repatriation of refugees and the resumption of negotiations between the two sides. New Zealand strongly supports this line of action.
67.	This has been an active year in the field of international law-making, although it has not been as productive as most of us would have wished.
68.	New Zealand attaches the greatest importance to the achievement of a new convention on the law of the sea. When you think of that vast area of ocean around us and around the Polynesian islands with which we are so closely associated, you will realize how keenly we are interested in this question. We have, therefore, shared the widespread sense of frustration at the lack of progress during the last session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea on the main issues which are delaying general agreement. We remain committed to the goal of a universally supported treaty on this vital subject. We believe that rapid progress towards this goal is now absolutely essential if the
Conference is not to lose the great chance it has to secure an equitable and stable regime for the world's oceans. In the absence of such progress, New Zealand, like many other States, will inevitably shorten its focus and concentrate on consultations and arrangements within its own region.
69.	I shall turn now to one aspect only of a subject which perhaps overrides all others in its global implications: the question of disarmament.
70.	The aspect that has especially worried New Zealanders is the question of nuclear weapons testing and proliferation. We know that to put an end to the testing of nuclear weapons is not, in itself, a disarmament measure, but we believe that it is an important confidence-building step, an essential preliminary to nuclear disarmament.
71.	It is a great relief to us in New Zealand that the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere in our part of the world has stopped during the past 12 months. We regret that it continues elsewhere. As recently as yesterday, we have had news of substantial radioactive fall-out right here on our doorstep from a nuclear explosion many thousands of miles away. What the safety level for such fall-out is no one can be sure, but it is obviously desirable that any increase in existing levels should be avoided.
72.	However, that in itself is not enough. Only a comprehensive test-ban treaty, ending weapons testing in all environments and not only in the atmosphere, can be counted as a genuine first step on the road towards nuclear disarmament. One of the main stumbling-blocks to the conclusion of such a treaty has been the question of on-site inspection. We think it is very encouraging that, in a document recently circulated [see A/311232], the Soviet Union has now indicated willingness to consider a com-promise on this issue. The language of the Soviet note is, however, not altogether clear. It is important, we feel, that on-site inspection should not depend entirely on the consent of the State in question.
73.	Another stumbling-block in the way of a comprehensive test-ban agreement has been the unwillingness of certain nuclear Powers to take part in the negotiations. It is our hope that they will take heed cf the increasing concern of world public opinion about the ever increasing growth and proliferation of nuclear weapons and that they will adopt a more co-operative approach.
74.	In this connexion, I stress the need for the utmost control over the exportation of sensitive nuclear facilities and I am thinking particularly of processing plants. Things are bad and dangerous enough now, but they could get very much worse, and even over the short period. The suppliers of nuclear fuel and material have a responsibility not only to themselves but also to the rest of the world to ensure that their commercial activities do not facilitate nuclear weapons proliferation. Profits will be of little value in a nuclear holocaust.
75.	I have touched on several aspects of what I might call a general human rights theme: I have discussed human rights in New Zealand, economic rights in the South Pacific and the developing world generally; I have discussed human rights in southern Africa, and, in relation to disarmament, what I might call the human right to survive. I should like to conclude by referring to one further aspect of the human rights theme, and that concerns the question of international terrorism. I agree absolutely with the comment of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his annual report to the Assembly on the work of the Organization that the time has come for a new and determined approach by the international community to this growing and worrying problem [see A/31/l/Add. l, sect. V]. No one can deny that the increasing frequency and scope of acts of terrorism pose a serious threat to the integrity of the whole human society as we know it. My Government therefore welcomes the initiative taken by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the elaboration of a convention on the taking of hostages and we hope that the Assembly will be prepared to examine it in a positive spirit [A/31/242].
76.	Surely it is not too much to hope that, when this Assembly ends, its work may be marked down as a positive contribution towards strengthening economic, social and political rights, especially of all poor and oppressed peoples everywhere, and to the freeing of all mankind from the fear of nuclear destruction.
"
3229,38,1983,PNG,"﻿My delegation wishes to join previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly.
22.	We also wish to express our sincere appreciation of the able manner in which your predecessor, Mr. Imre Hollai, guided the deliberations of the thirty-seventh session.
23.	Like other speakers, my delegation also warmly welcomes the admission of the newly independent island State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. We look forward 
to cordial and close relations between our two countries both here and within the Commonwealth.
24.	When I spoke in this Hall at the thirtieth session
, a few weeks after Papua New Guinea gained independence, I outlined the approach we were going to take to international relations. That approach we called universalism: friendship for all except racist regimes.
25.	Since then our policies have evolved and developed. We have built stronger links with a number of countries— those geographically close to us in the Pacific and Asia and our major economic partners. Our foreign policies have matured and are now presented under the general title of  purposeful direction . By this we mean that, without being strident or aggressive, we are pushing for progress towards international equity and order.
26.	What do we intend by that? Very simply put, we believe that order can be achieved in relations between sovereign States and that an economically and socially equitable world-wide order can be organized. My Government is a strong supporter of the United Nations and other international organizations. We hope and believe that those organizations can bring about a new international arrangement of which equity and order are the paramount features.
27.	We believe that neither equity nor order can last long in this world without each other. If we look around the world today we see examples of apparent order coupled with gross inequity and of people striving for equity amid gross disorder. For many people today equity and order must seem to be remote ideals. We in Papua New Guinea, while recognizing the barriers and difficulties, believe that both equity and order can be achieved— indeed they both must be achieved.
28.	I would first like to discuss the question of international order. To many people in southern Africa, Chad, Lebanon, Central America and Afghanistan, international order must seem an impossible ideal. They are suffering the effects of racism and international tensions which it seems this Organization can do little to moderate.
29.	With regard to the arms race, world-wide spending on arms is estimated to be a staggering $800 billion a year. Considering this, none of us can safely be said to be immune from the dangers of war or the economic consequences of the arms race. I will discuss the economic consequences of this massive spending later. First I will discuss the implications for the Pacific and South-East Asia.
30.	The South Pacific is not a region of intense great- Power rivalry. The possibility of armed conflict arising between military forces of countries in our region appears slight. But we in the Pacific are not immune to the effects of world tensions. Neither the South Pacific nor Southeast Asia is far enough away from the super-Powers to be free of the effects of the arms race. The members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [/1SE4N] have had first-hand and extremely painful recent experience of great Power rivalries and regional conflict. A generation ago we in the Pacific suffered similarly. We do not want to see it happen again. We believe that the vast expenditure on arms is not contributing to security: we believe it is contributing to insecurity. We believe the recent increases in arms spending and in international tension are closely related.
31.	The present build-up can lead only to tragedy. The recent deplorable shooting down of the South Korean airliner and the tragic bombing in Burma are examples of what could happen. We believe that such incidents underline the need for international disarmament and a concerted effort to reduce international tensions. They also clearly indicate that organizations like the United Nations must act to provide safeguards for international travellers.
32.	I come now to the subject of nuclear testing. Another aspect of arms development which greatly concerns Papua New Guinea is nuclear testing in the Pacific. We have for several years now protested in the strongest terms against the hazards to human health and the environment presented by the French Government's nuclear-weapon testing programmes on Mururoa Atoll. We have also opposed any plans to dump or store nuclear wastes in the sea. To give effect to these positions we have ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, supported the proposed extension of the Convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matter, signed at London in 1972  to prohibit the dumping of all radioactive wastes, and consistently express  our outrage at the French Government's persistent and blatant disregard of regional opinion. Papua New Guinea has accepted an invitation to send a scientist to inspect the Mururoa facilities. This inspection does not imply any tacit acceptance of nuclear testing. Rather, it will promote greater scientific examination of the effects of the French programme. At the same time, we are studying the various attempts being made in all parts of the world to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
33.	We believe that racism, along with the arms race, is one of the most serious threats to peace and order in the world today. As I mentioned earlier, when I addressed the Assembly eight years ago as the leader of a newly independent nation, I stated that we would be friendly to all nations except racists. The policy of unceasing opposition to racism still applies. Racism and
are by their very nature inconsistent with any concept of lasting international order. They offend the principles on which societies like mine are founded. Practitioners of racism and apartheid deserve not only condemnation but isolation. The opponents of racism deserve our strong, continual support.
34.	Many small countries are the victims of racism and colonialism. As Prime Minister of a small country, I believe that I have a special obligation and interest in putting their case. Small countries have a right to be free from invasion or other forms of unwanted intervention from outside. The right to be free from foreign invasion or intervention is absolutely basic to any concept of lasting international order. I should like, therefore, to underline my Government's strong support for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. For identical reasons, I should like to do the same in respect of the Soviet presence in Afghanistan.
35.	The most tenacious and extensive form of international interference is colonialism. I grew up and entered public life in a dependency which consisted of a Trust Territory and a colony. That experience has given me a special feeling for the importance of the right to national self-determination and for the role that the United Nations can play in its realization. I should therefore like to lend my Government's strong support to calls that the right to self-determination be extended to the remaining colonial territories. I urge other Members of the United Nations to co-operate in seeing that this right is extended to all those still suffering under the yoke of colonialism.
36.	One of the particular applications of this in the South Pacific that we are concerned with is in New Caledonia. One of our regional organizations is the South Pacific Forum, the members of which have accepted a variety of methods of decolonization. We believe that the 
continued denial of the right of colonial peoples to determine their own future is an affront to all thinking people. The French Government has announced some reforms. The South Pacific Forum has supported those measures, but we have also called for an act of self-determination which includes the option of independence and provides special safeguards for the Kanakas, a precise timetable for transition to independence and a visit by a mission representative of Forum members to observe developments. We are also considering the possibility of securing wider support for our position by placing New Caledonia again on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories.
37.	The situation in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands is clearer, as are the responsibilities of the United Nations. There, my Government has been pleased to be a member of the visiting missions sent to observe the plebiscites on termination of the trust. We want to ensure that the rights of Micronesians are respected.
38.	We believe that respect for the rights of other people, which, I would suggest, obviates all forms of colonialism, is integral to the creation of an equitable and ordered world system. It is basic to the kind of society we are trying to build in Papua New Guinea. We urge all Governments to respect human rights.
39.	However, human rights, about which the Charter of the United Nations is so eloquent, do not exist in a vacuum. We need to be conscious  of their social context. We must be careful to ensure that a concern for human rights does not become a pretext for undue meddling in the affairs of others. While qualifying our stance in that fashion, I reiterate that Papua New Guinea condemns those who ignore, or offend against, human rights, and we add our voice to those calling for remedial action where needed.
40.	We are also extremely concerned about the Middle East. That area continues to be among the most disordered regions in the world. Conflicts there could escalate into much wider and more perilous confrontation at any time. This situation disturbs us greatly, and I should like again to add my country's voice and vote in support of those who seek peaceful solutions.
41.	As a sign of our concern, my Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade attended the preparatory meetings for the International Conference on the Question of Palestine. As Unsaid then, the Papua New Guinea Government  recognizes the rights of the Palestinians, including their right to participate in determining their political future . . . At the same time, we maintain our recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign State. 
42.	We have been, and are, supporters of the Camp David accords. Recently we have been impressed by the increasingly active and constructive role being played by Governments and other protagonists in the region in exploring possible solutions. We lend our support to those who are working to bring equity and order to the Palestinian situation, to the calamitous conflicts in Lebanon and to the situation in the other countries in the region.
43.	Until now I have been discussing issues related to international order. I should like now to turn to issues related to international equity. We believe that those concepts are inextricably intertwined: there cannot be long-term order without equity, and there cannot be equity without order.
44.	The present international economic system is not equitable, and consequently international relations are not orderly. The present system features broad and growing differences in wealth; it is inherently unstable. We believe that meaningful steps to change this situation must be taken, and must be taken quickly.
45.	My country has been hit hard by the current recession. The prices of the commodities on which village people depend for their incomes have fallen dramatically. Many of them are at their lowest real level since we began large-scale participation in the international economy. Government income has been seriously reduced. Plans for increased Government services have been suspended, public works budgets have been cut, and we have been forced to retrench part of our public services. Our long- term plan to achieve fiscal self-reliance has suffered a severe setback. We are grateful to the Australian Government for its increased support, but at the same time regret its necessity.
46.	However, while grappling with the effects of this recession we must not lose sight of the fundamental weaknesses in the international economic system. The present system is inequitable, and there is a need for long- term structural adjustments.
47.	We in the Pacific are a microcosm of the overall world situation. A villager from my country—from even the most remote village—is affected by international economic trends. Like most developing countries, Papua New Guinea has developed countries as its most important trading partners. Our most important sources of foreign investment, foreign aid and commercial loans are also in developed countries. Needless to say, these relationships are vital to us, but are of far less importance to the developed countries. Manufactured products are imported. So is a good deal of expensive Western expertise. Our exports consist mainly of a small range of largely unprocessed primary products.
48.	We in the Pacific have taken several concrete steps towards reducing these inequities. We are seeking increased technical co-operation with ASEAN countries. A trade agreement with Australia and New Zealand gives products from Pacific countries preferential conditions. Our regional forum has established a fisheries agency to secure our common interests, and we have started a regional shipping line.
49.	None the less, neither the trade agreements we have with Australia and New Zealand nor the Lome Convention have made much difference in the kinds of products exported from Papua New Guinea. South Pacific countries in general have an increasingly adverse balance of trade with developed countries. We believe that this trade imbalance is only a part of a wider and deeper imbalance in relations between the two sets of countries.
50.	My country has called for regional co-operation towards a comprehensive restructuring of relations in the region, leading to a new Pacific order. We believe that in the Pacific as well as in the rest of the developing world, failure to restructure basic relationships will lead to economic stagnation and decline in developing countries. The primary changes we want to see are reduced tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with developed countries and a transfer of skills and technology to developing countries.
51.	The current recession has demonstrated yet again the interdependence of all national economies. My Government calls on all Members of the United Nations to work together interdependent  in an effort to right present inequalities.
52.	As I mentioned earlier, we are concerned about the destabilizing effects of the arms race on international order. We are also concerned about its effects on equity. It poses a/threat to our vital communications and trade reunion the Pacific. It also, in the words of the secretariat 
of UNCTAD, imposes  strains ... on the flow of resources for development, and ... on the international economic system as a whole .
38.	The majority of South Pacific countries do not have standing military forces. Those forces that do exist are small. Disarmament, therefore, is less of an issue for island Governments and peoples than is the prevention of armament. We are trying to bring basic services and development to our peoples. We wish to avoid the extraordinary costs and dangers of arms spending. As I said earlier, approximately $800 billion is spent annually on armaments. That spending, given the poverty of most of the people in the world, is obscene.
39.	The law of the sea and the establishment of effective 200-mile economic zones are vital economic issues in the Pacific. As Prime Minister of a country with vast, untapped marine resources, I am committed to the establishment of an effective 200-mile economic zone. My Government is also strongly committed to the notion that the sea-bed beyond national economic zones is the common heritage of mankind. We are pleased at the progress being made by the Preparatory Commission for the International Sea-Bed Authority and for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. I must, however, repeat my Government's criticism of those Governments which decline for reasons of narrow self-interest to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
60.	The Common Fund for Commodities and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea must surely rank among the most outstanding contributions to potential international equity and order. I appeal to all Governments represented here to bring the Common Fund and the Convention fully into effect.
61.	My Government believes that the present state of international economic and political relations is extremely unsatisfactory. We believe there is need for international equity and order. Today I have noted the trends that we consider dangerous and have outlined in very general terms the changes we believe are necessary.
62.	Papua New Guinea is a small country—in United Nations terms, a very small country. We are realistic about our influence in this Hall, but we have not allowed that realism to degenerate into cynical indifference. The people of Papua New Guinea have benefited from the attitudes and influence of the United Nations as well as from the work of its agencies. We believe that the United Nations has the ability to contribute effectively to the struggle for international equity and order. I call on the United Nations and all other international organizations to work for a more just and equitable world.
























 
 
"
3272,38,1983,AUS,"﻿144.	 Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon your election as President of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. The experience of Panama—and your personal role in that experience—ensure that you will serve in this high office with distinction.
145.	The Australian Government also warmly welcomes Saint Christopher and Nevis, now the 158th Member of the United Nations.
146.	In this year's report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General observes that the drive towards an effective, peaceful and more equitable world order has slowed, that the incentive to develop international institutions has weakened, that political will has dissipated.
147.	He has urged a return to the far-sighted diplomacy of the founding years of the Organization and a recommitment by all of us to the Charter. The regaining of that vision and that commitment has become an urgent responsibility. We must recognize the extent to which we have drawn on the credit and credibility which underlie the whole operation of the United Nations. We must act with a genuine sense of urgency to re-establish the vitality and the authority of the Organization.
148.	It is true that millions around the world have better lives—have lives to live—because of the work of the United Nations agencies. It is equally true—and we must accept the consequences—that in the past 38 years a very significant proportion of the world's population has grown up judging the United Nations by what it has not been able to do. They are not just the people predisposed to scoff at the noble aspirations defined at the founding Conference at San Francisco. They include the most passionate believers in the civilized world community for which the United Nations stands. They have suffered too long being deprived of what this body can offer them.
149.	We have the Charter. We have the principles. What we lack is the consistent will to implement them—a sufficient commitment to this institution which is the real and only expression of the international community. There are notable achievements on the United Nations record, but we c not overlook any longer those many unfulfilled expectations.
150.	Mr. Evatt, one of the first Presidents of the General Assembly and a distinguished predecessor of mine, sought to guarantee the position of the middle and small Powers because he knew that they would need the United Nations most. He wanted limitations on the use of the veto in the Security Council and enhanced powers for the General Assembly. The importance of these ideas for an effective, participatory United Nations is undiminished.
151.	Realistically, Australia accepts that it is not possible to go back literally to the structure and procedures envisaged in the 1940s. While it is true, for example, that the powers given to the Security Council to deter, prevent, punish and terminate aggression were thought practicable then, they are no longer so. Those sections of the Charter providing such powers were based on a great-Power consensus that was always fragile and, in the event, was short-lived.
152.	Today the Security Council must operate by persuasion and consent, but it must operate better. A number of suggestions have been made in this regard—most notably by the Secretary-General and by the Governments of the Nordic countries. It is the earnest hope of the Australian Government that the specific proposals to come forward during this session will be firm and practical, and that they will be acted upon.
153.	Obviously, the Security Council is at the nub of any proposition to make the operation of the United Nations more effective, and the crucial element in what happens there is the state of relations between the superpowers. It is clear to us all, and acknowledged by the parties themselves, that the relationship is going through a difficult phase. I do not doubt that the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union are aware that a serious mistake or a breakdown in the management of that relationship could destroy us all in this age of nuclear weapons.
154.	The United Nations was planned to be a forum for discussion of the major issues of concern to the world. But there is a responsibility we all share—particularly the super-Powers, but also the countries of the North and South, East and West—to avoid undermining this institution by allowing it to become merely another venue for the pursuit of sterile objectives such as bilateral competition between the super-Powers or empty rhetoric by one group making unrealistic demands of another.
155.	I appeal to both sides in all earnestness and good faith to pay regard to the wider significance and potential of this single all-embracing institution of the world community. The United Nations is all of us. I do not suggest a retreat from reality, only an effort to minimize the potentially crippling impact upon this body at a time when it is, we have to acknowledge, debilitated.
156.	Obviously, the United Nations can never be fully effective without normal relations between the superpowers. I suggest only that we try to maintain it in the best condition possible until that time arrives.
157.	There is one sense in which the super-Powers live in a world exclusive of others. They deal with each other on issues and on a plane that others cannot share. Yet all our destinies are potentially at stake in their relationship. And it is here in the United Nations that we who are not great Powers see our best opportunity to make known our shared concern.
158.	It seems to us that these great and threatening tensions arise from fundamental misconceptions. The difficulty is to find adequate means of addressing those fundamentals when there are such compelling distractions in the flow of events within the relationship.
159.	There is no ambiguity in Australia's position in the broad picture. We are allied with the United States. We are a democracy. We support democratic institutions and those that share our values. The Australian Government, like Governments of other democracies, expresses the will and the interests of the people who elect us. When the Soviet Union chose to destroy an unarmed Korean airliner we condemned its action in the strongest terms—and that, manifestly, was the feeling of our people. The same was true of the reaction in democratic societies to the invasion of Afghanistan. Democratic Governments reflect their constituencies, or they do not survive. By virtue of that same process, we can assure the Soviets with utter certainty that the people of our democracies have no interest in confrontation.
160.	Whatever judgement Soviet leaders may make about the system in the West, they have no justification for a view that it is bent on the destruction of the Soviet people's security and welfare. In their theoretical analysis of the world and their vision of the future, those Soviet leaders must concede a secure and lasting place to the West and to the non-aligned and developing countries. It is not legitimate to seek the subversion and overthrow of these countries.
161.	In the West, as we also assess future prospects, we must concede a proper place for the Soviet Union—not only in terms of power but also as defined by the legitimate concerns and aspirations of the Soviet peoples. The extent to which those peoples have suffered in war and invasion—and not only in this century—is something almost beyond the comprehension of most of us. Yet that experience greatly influences Soviet judgements and policies, and must be understood. To understand is not to exculpate, however, when transgressions of proper international conduct occur.
162.	Essentially, I am suggesting that wherever possible, we encourage and assist the super-Powers to moderate antagonisms, to obtain new understandings, perhaps to find new mechanisms for political action and consultation, and that all of us rid ourselves of dangerous stereotypes and misconceptions. The United Nations must be capable of providing some of those mechanisms. Unquestionably, the need is even greater now than at the time of the founding of the Organization. From this distance we may judge that there was excessive enthusiasm then for a body with the authority of a final arbiter. Today, we cannot expect it to be that.
163.	Since the fragile consensus of the greater Powers disappeared, the Security Council has had to operate by persuasion and consent—a situation unlikely to change in the near future. Security Council members have a privileged position in the United Nations system. This is even more true of the five permanent members, and especially true of the two super-Powers. It is the view of the Australian Government that additional responsibilities accompany that privilege. The greater the privilege, the greater the responsibility. I hope the Council will begin to look more often to its composition.
164.	I am pleased to note the Secretary-General's efforts to work more closely with the Security Council and hope that they will be reciprocated. It may be timely to review the whole body of procedures and mechanisms employed by the Council. Periodic and private meetings of the Security Council, as envisaged in earlier times, could be useful in the present climate. Private meetings may be helpful in developing arrangements for the informal examination of a dispute in its early stages.
165.	The habit of having public debates after the fighting has started has not, as a general rule, been beneficial. When the Security Council meets during an outbreak of hostilities, it is difficult not to regard a demand for the cessation of hostilities as a minimum demand. Yet, the truth very often is that the demand is not practical and might anyway give an advantage to the aggressor.
166.	One of the trends that has weakened the authority of the United Nations in recent years is the bypassing of the Security Council, usually for one of two reasons: the certainty of a veto or the likelihood of insubstantial action. On the latter point, it is not beyond us to devise a better methodology, taking into account the practical possibilities of information-gathering, United Nations involvement, initiation of discussions or negotiations between the parties and follow-up. As to the veto, valid arguments have been presented frequently for and against it, but it remains with us. In my view, however, we are entitled to expect that those who hold such power will use it with restraint and on the basis of considerations that go beyond mere self-interest. It does not exist to promote immobility.
167.	The Charter was designed as a practical instrument as well as a statement of principle and the veto power is one practical recognition that all States are not equal in terms of power. It is a practical reminder that some Members are able to exercise a stronger claim on our attention than others. On the other hand, the Charter created a democracy in the General Assembly. Here, our common interests predominate. The Assembly and the Security Council should be mutually supportive in their relationship. The overall results should provide, for those many countries who need it, the assurance that the highest priority can be the well-being of their people rather than a costly pursuit of security.
168.	To provide this assurance, I suggest, the United Nations must find the capability and the will to mount effective peace-keeping operations. As I stated earlier, the Organization has been notably weakened by being bypassed when such a need arises; yet there can be no expectation of effective United Nations action. Perhaps the most obvious feature of past peace-keeping ventures by the United Nations was that the war was already under way when the peace-keepers were sent. In these times when grass fires can so readily become conflagrations, we must surely think carefully about the scope for more pre-emptive action.
169.	Along with remedial action in respect of peacekeeping, there is desperate need for revitalized United Nations activity in the areas of disarmament negotiations and the defence of human rights.
170.	A fundamental area of concern to the United Nations and to all decent people is the need for vigilance in the preservation of human rights. The reality is that the United Nations and its Members have made great progress in this field, whether it is defined in terms of fundamental political freedoms, action against racism, action against sexism, or the general development of law and legal practice affecting human rights. But human rights, individually and collectively, are still violated daily. One of the fundamental tests of a principled organization like the United Nations will be its ability to protect the rights of individuals as human beings. Human rights are gravely challenged by deteriorations in economic and political conditions. Seeking to guarantee them in law is essential, but we must stop the common phenomenon of human rights being the first casualty of economic and political difficulty. We must stop this not only because it is wrong, but also because the seeds of a second round of violence are sown when human rights are ignored. Central to the policy of all Governments must be a determination to pursue economic and social policies compatible with the preservation of the rights of the individual.
171.	The debate about the right to development, in the United Nations bodies concerned with human rights, is important in the North-South economic debate. We understand that human rights in the absence of economic rights seem hollow to the poor of the world. Poor men, after all, are more impressed with the provision of bread than with the abstract wisdom of Western thought. They are, however, best served when they benefit from both. Similarly, struggling developing nations are more inspired by guaranteed access to export markets, better pricing policies, adequate credit on reasonable terms and a fair flow of investment funds with which to promote their development than by the cold comfort of homilies about the fictitious free flow of market forces in international trade.
172.	I have noted the emphasis placed by many speakers on the fragility and dangers inherent in the present international economic situation. The nature of these problems, as well as the need for the rich countries of the world to respond generously—and indeed, in their own interests—to the economic difficulties of the developing nations, including the indebtedness of many third-world countries, is clear. If I can expand on a metaphor of Claude Cheysson, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, which likened the potential economic failure of some developing countries to an aircraft stalling at the point of take-off, I would add that should crash landings occur, they would be in the midst of substantial slabs of developed nations' economies. The effect would be mutually crippling, not only in terms of the impact of failed major financial institutions, but also as a consequence of the disastrous impact on two-way North-South trade flows. In fact, if we fail to help remedy the economic problems of the developing world, we shall invest deeply and unwisely in policies which may well disable the developed world itself.
173.	In these circumstances, the proposals for the new international economic order, the Brandt Commission report and the principles of the North-South dialogue should command more constructive and determined responses from the developed nations of the world than they have so far been ready to make. Some of the key proposals contain economic and logistical problems, but these difficulties are not reason enough for doing nothing—or, at most, precious little—about them.
174.	As a democratic socialist Government, the Government of Australia is firmly committed to working constructively and practically in pursuit of the objectives set down in these various programmes and we wish that there would be an unambiguous declaration of renewed intent on the part of all industrialized nations to work towards these ends. In this way, we feel, the moral compulsions in defence of human rights are directly linked with a demonstrated and genuine concern for economic rights.
175.	But nothing threatens human rights, life, or a decent standard of living more than war and armaments. During the last year we have witnessed in all parts of our heterogeneous world a rising voice against the arms race. That voice must be heard, especially by those in government who have the responsibility for making decisions.
176.	What is at issue is a fundamental refusal by people all over the world to accept that humanity will be defeated and destroyed by technology. The question is—do we run the machine or does it run us? Will the awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb overwhelm us and destroy us?
177.	It is more than a rhetorical comment to say that nuclear weapons represent a genocide of the human spirit. Their destructive power is overwhelming. They represent an expression of the genius of man in science and technology. But to allow the genius to turn against humanity is to admit the final genocide.
178.	As the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report to the General Assembly, the principles of the Charter are no more closely tied to the survival of humanity than in the field of disarmament. Interestingly, he has said that we need a recommitment to those principles. In this single word he has drawn our attention to a fact of vital significance, that is, that the principles are there, they exist in the Charter and that they held a livelier place in our imagination and our actions in the past than they do today. That place must be restored and strengthened. We must recommit ourselves to the maintenance of peace with the lowest possible level of armaments and to disarmament as one of mankind's highest practical goals. The need for this is urgent and this is what the people of the world are telling us. They will not accept that the system is out of control. They will not accept the arms-race mentality. The stakes at issue are far too high and the possibility of error leading to global catastrophe grows daily and in direct proportion to the introduction of every new nuclear-weapon system.
179.	The Australian Government is committed to the arms control and disarmament goals of the United Nations, as enshrined both in the Charter and in the substantial fabric of international law that has been developed since the Organization came into existence. That body of law should be developed further and adhered to universally. One of the Australian Government's first actions following its election was to make policy decisions in the disarmament Held which elevated disarmament and arms control goals to the required level of priority within our foreign policy, particularly in relation to our role within the wider world community. It did this motivated by the certain knowledge that this was what the Australian people wanted.
180.	Australia is determined that there will be an end to the nuclear arms race and a reduction in the number and kinds of nuclear weapons held by nuclear-weapon States. We are determined that the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons shall be strengthened and adhered to universally. Linking these two objectives, we are determined that there should be an end to nuclear testing in all environments for all time. We will seek, with all the vigour possible, an international agreement to ensure that the arms race does not extend to outer space.
181.	Nuclear issues are central to the survival of mankind, but people die daily, and in alarming numbers, through the use of conventional weapons. The arms trade is running at some $700 billion a year. This is a major threat to life and human rights. It provides no security. It is manifestly an illusion to believe that security stems from the barrel of a gun, and the allocation of resources to this trade, instead of to development and the promotion of decent standards of living, is a scandal of monumental proportions.
182.	Military budgets must be reduced. The arms trade must be curbed. Action must be taken to stop the black- market trade in arms. Australia believes that these three goals are ideal subjects for negotiation by the United Nations. Accordingly, we will be promoting action on them.
183.	Chemical weapons—the so-called poor man's atomic bomb—are abhorrent. Their effects are devastating and inhumane. They are cheap and easily stored. They are ideally suited to the non-industrial world, and they must be outlawed. Australia will try to see an international convention developed that will have this effect.
184.	I should like now to turn to several issues of particular concern to Australia.
185.	Australia is and will always be a part of the Southeast Asian and South Pacific region. We are naturally concerned that a stalemate continues over the Kampuchean question. This perpetuates a situation of instability between the countries of Indo-China and neighbouring countries, in which the immediate victims are the Kampuchean people themselves. Australia favours a political solution in Kampuchea. We do not support any approach based on a continuation of the present military activity. Any resolution of the conflict will need to include such basic requirements as the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and a form of self-determination for the people of that country. Unfortunately I expect no quick solution.
186.	With regard to southern Africa, we fully understand the frustration expressed by many delegations that the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia should have been obstructed for so long. It is clear now that the long-delayed independence of Namibia is being held up by extraneous issues not encompassed in the United Nations plan, such as its linkage with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Australia believes that those extraneous issues should not be allowed to impede Namibia's accession to independence.
187.	I am also concerned to note that the repugnant system of apartheid continues without meaningful modification in South Africa. It is abhorrent to the human spirit that the State should exercise such blatant discrimination against its own citizens on the basis of race. This in turn sows the seeds of instability as the State continues to find it necessary to suppress the aspirations of those seeking to give expression to their rights.
188.	Last year at this time the General Assembly expressed its anguish at the cruel events which had engulfed Lebanon and its people. It is a tragedy that Lebanon is still in the grip of turmoil and conflict. It is more than ever urgent that the conditions be created to enable the Government of Lebanon to assert its authority over its sovereign territory. We welcome the cease-fire as an indispensable first step towards a peaceful settlement. We sincerely hope that all sides in the conflict will be able to meet in a genuine effort to find a solution to Lebanon's internal problems in the knowledge that Lebanon's hopes for the future lie in dialogue.
189.	The tragedy of Lebanon has also served to emphasize yet again the continuing and pressing need for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Middle East dispute. For Australia, this means the need to sustain the right of Israel to exist behind secure and recognized borders. That is an absolute commitment. But, equally, it means recognition of the central importance of the Palestinian issue in any settlement. The Australian Government acknowledges the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, including their rights, if they so choose, to independence and the possibility of establishing their own independent State. The Australian Government also recognizes that any arrangement finally agreed upon will evolve from processes involving the peoples of the immediate region, including those of Syria and Jordan. The roles and views of the super-Powers cannot be ignored in any such process.
190.	Earlier this year I noted, on behalf of the Australian Government, that Indonesia had incorporated East Timor in its territory, and at the same time I expressed our concern that an internationally supervised and accepted act of self-determination had not taken place. Australia notes the decision of the Assembly to defer consideration of the situation in East Timor until the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We hope that Indonesia and Portugal will be able to use the time between now and the next session to reach a lasting settlement of this question, a settlement which will take into account the best interests of the people of East Timor.
191.	Tensions in Central America have increased since the last session of General Assembly. Australia believes that solutions to the problems of this region lie in the maintenance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and in the efforts directed towards domestic reforms and reconciliation. Australia therefore welcomes and supports the important role the countries of the Contadora Group are now playing in seeking to develop a dialogue and a consensus among the countries of the region.
192.	Before concluding my statement, I feel obliged to turn to an issue which is on the agenda of the General Assembly for the first time and which is of particular importance to Australia, namely, Antarctica.
193.	The Antarctic Treaty is a uniquely successful international instrument of co-operation. It is a major disarmament agreement and excludes all military activities. It forbids nuclear explosions in Antarctica and prohibits the dumping of nuclear waste. There is a comprehensive system of on-site inspection, with observers being guaranteed freedom of access at any time to all areas of Antarctica. The resulting demilitarization and denuclearization of the continent—to which the two super-Powers are parties—is of great value to mankind and of specific value to Australia as a neighbouring continent.
194.	The Antarctic regime is also an instrument of conservation and management of resources.
195.	I should add that the Treaty is not exclusive. Any State may accede, and 28 nations with diverse economic and political interests have already done so. The most recent adherents to the Treaty are India and China.
196.	Australia is concerned about the introduction of this matter into the United Nations lest the substantial achievements of the Treaty system be put at risk. The United Nations was created to solve problems, not to create new ones.
197.	It is the opinion of the Australian Government that any attempt to negotiate a new international agreement on Antarctica or to renegotiate parts of the Treaty would prove counter-productive and introduce uncertainty and possible instability into a region of hitherto unparalleled international harmony.
198.	The United Nations symbolizes and provides the framework for the steady, almost relentless, growth of a sense of world community. This sense of world community is a unique feature of the twentieth century—a product of communications technology, economic development and political consciousness—and this sense of world community will continue to grow with the inevitable increase in interdependence.
199.	In this context, the United Nations is absolutely essential. Indeed, its great achievement has been that for almost 40 years now, it has given effective and continuing expression to this new dimension of the community of nations. It has done this in a period of unparalleled change, including the era of decolonization, over which it presided, and major shifts in the disposition of power. To compare the agenda and compass of this body with those of the League of Nations 50 years ago is to appreciate why one has endured and the other could not. The evolution of this essential institution cannot be allowed to falter now.
200.	We cannot escape the fact that the process is becoming more and more difficult—not least because this growing sense of world community sits uneasily with the system of nation States that were chosen as the basis of our political system. The inherent tension between notions of untrammelled national interest and a growing sense of world community present our greatest challenge, as individual Governments and as United Nations. We face great enough pressures individually; the United Nations must bear the sum of these conflicts and manage them constructively.
201.	The alternatives are limited: a world, in a state of perpetual tension, dominated by a handful of great Powers, or a resort to arms that would leave very little future for any of us. These, I remind the Assembly, were the very things the United Nations was created to eliminate.
 

"
3291,38,1983,VUT,"﻿89.	 Mr. President, I extend to
you and your country the warm congratulations and
sincere best wishes of the Government and people of
Vanuatu on your election to the high office of President
of the thirty-eighth session of the General Assembly. This
promises to be a most significant session and perhaps one
of the most critical international gatherings of modern
history. We are confident that your leadership will be
equal to the task and will reflect your many years of
diplomatic experience and expertise, your careful and
considered judgement and the courage and candour for
which you and the Government and people of Panama
are noted.
90.	Under your guidance we anticipate the same thoughtfulness and impartiality which our deliberations enjoyed
during the last session under the very capable leadership
of Mr. Imre Hollai of Hungary. His also was a difficult
tenure and one which earned the gratitude of the entire
international community.
91.	We also believe that congratulations are in order to
another outstanding diplomat, Mr. Davidson Hepburn,
the representative of the Bahamas. His candidacy for
the office of President of this year's General Assembly
strengthened the democratic process within the United
Nations and was a visible and dignified expression of the
vitality of the Organization's democracy. His candidacy
was also important for two other reasons. First, he represents a country which, like ours, is a small isled developing State. Very often the particular difficulties and
needs of such States are overlooked within the international arena. Secondly, his country is in a sub region, the
Caribbean, which like our own sub region, the South
Pacific is similarly often overlooked. It is our hope that
Mr. Hepburn's candidacy will at last signal an awakening
to the fact that all nations, like all people, are created
equal.
92.	Panama Is also a country small in size but great in
stature and reputation. Thus, this year's friendly contest
for the presidency of the General Assembly made winner
of us all. It afforded us the unique opportunity to choose
between two highly qualified candidates from smash countries. For this reason we salute you both and say to you
that we will all be forever grateful.
93.	We also congratulate the Government and people
of Saint Christopher and Nevis, another small island
developing into a  State, on their country's attainment of independence and on becoming the iS8th Member of the
United Nations. Its presence in our midst strengthens the
Organization and its democracy and bears witness to the
universality of mankind and this world body.
94.	It is occasionally necessary to applaud and exercise
in democracy here at the United Nations because some
do not always practise what they preach. There are those
who espouse a belief in the dignity and quality of all?
mankind and all nations yet ignore the smaller countries
until they seek our votes on a specific item. There are
those who profess a belief in freedom of expression yet the
General Assembly does not welcome the exercise of such freedom by smaller
States that may, on occasion, hold different positions
from those they have taken. There are those who like us 
believe in a free market of ideas. However, they do
resent when the mood strikes them 
to close the market or force it to move elsewhere
because they do not always like the ideas being presented.
95.	Obviously such thinking is not only irrational but
also painfully short-sighted and rather childish. For mankind, the United Nations is still a great
organization, it is certainly not perfect. Nothing mankind
has yet created can claim that distinction. However, it
is perhaps the best and most important institution we have?
yet created. If we have the will it can be strengthened and
made better, but only if we have the will and if we respect
and enhance its decisions and its democratic processes.
96.	This is not to say that these critics do not come from
democratic societies. In fact, the irony is that their own
societies are in many ways models of democracy for the
protection of individual rights. We simply wish that they
would pause for a moment to reflect on the democratic
ideas of other societies, including those that stress the
protection of collective rights. Furthermore, we wish that
everyone would lend stronger support to the practice of
democracy than to the exercise of power in international
deliberations.
97.	We in Vanuatu owe a great deal to the United
Nations, as does every other nation that was a colony at
the close of the Second World War. Others who owe a
great deal to the United Nations include millions of
persons who are no longer ravaged by hunger and disease
or who have a place to sleep or who can read because
of the work of the United Nations specialized agencies?
Big nations and small nations owe a great deal to the
Organization because it has provided a universal forum
for discussion and exchange where there was none before.
98.	Naturally, the United Nations cannot be given credit
for every advance mankind has made since 1945, but it
can certainly be credited with enough to make us all proud. Not the least of the world body's accomplishments
is that it has brought us together from all corners of the
globe and made it somewhat easier for us to communicate
to get to know each other, bridging unnatural gaps
of suspicion and distrust. The United Nations cannot be
Named if we, the Members, have not taken full advantage
of this opportunity.
99.	We in Vanuatu are fortunate. Ours is a free and
open society, and we are situated in a region with neighbours who respect our tight to draw our own conclusions
and develop our country in our own fashion. We are
its unique manner and its still unrealised potential. One
of our fondest wishes is that people from other regions
will get to know and appreciate us and our region a little
hit more. For us, this session of the General Assembly
is an important step in that process
100.	It is always a rare and unique privilege to address
the General Assembly. This year the privilege is even rarer
and more unique because of the presence of so many
distinguished heads of States or Government here at this
thirty-eighth sessions. Most have come in response to the
appeal made at the Seventh Conference of Heads of State
or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at New
Delhi in March 1983, and the subsequent urging of the
highly esteemed chairperson of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, our good friend Mrs Indira Gandhi,
Prime Minister of India. All have come in recognition
of the fact that the United Nations, despite its shortcomings and its critics, continues to be the best, and perhaps
the last hope of mankind for our very survival on this
planet. In no other forum are all of the peoples of the
world represented. In no other forum do representatives
of the strong and the weak, the rich and the poor, the
proud and the humble, the well-educated and the undereducated of the entire world sit together and in theory,
if not always in fact, work together for solutions to the
problems which threaten our very existence as a form of
life.
102.	The attendance of so many world leaders at this
year's session signifies a long-overdue recognition of the
importance of the Organization. We hope that it will also
signify a renewed commitment on the part of all of its
Members to the letter and to the spirit of the Charter.
We hope too, that it will signify a firm determination to
take seriously the admonition of our able Secretary-
General, who, in his most recent report on the work of,
the Organization said, 'A continuous effort
to contribute to the implementation of United Nations
decisions should be an integral part of the foreign policy
of Member States to a far greater extent than it is at the
present time.' -
103.	In his report, the Secretary-General has once again
demonstrated the candour and insightful analysis which
we have come to expect of him and his excellent staff and
which is so essential if we, the Members of the United
Nations, are to take the necessary steps to strengthen the
Organization and make it more effective. We must remember that the failures and shortcomings of the United
Nations are the failures and shortcomings of the membership. All of us, large and small, old and new, developed and developing, share this responsibility. Either I
shall make our work here meaningful and successful or
we shall by our own actions reduce it to meaningless
irrelevance and abstraction. The choice lies with us. Our
respective peoples perceive the United Nations through
our actions and attach as much meaning to its pronouncements as we ourselves do.
104.	No one can deny that the United Nations, and
Indeed mankind, is at this very moment at one of those
Important and innumerable crossroads which recur in the
course of human history. At this moment, we are faced
with daily reminders of how technology has figuratively
reduced the size of the globe and brought us all closer
together. Unfortunately, the very same technology has
far too often fuelled, in some people, an uncontrollable
greed and desire to rule and control the resources of other
people. Thus, although we live in a world of great abundance, which is capable of producing even more, far too
many people live in a world of constant scarcity. This
scarcity is not only a scarcity of material goods, which
would be difficult enough to explain and cope with, but
 a scarcity of respect and of opportunity.
105.	It is this tatter scarcity which is most distressing
and most inexcusable as we stand poised on the brink of
the twenty-first century, it is this scarcity more titan any
other factor which has been to the seemingly never-ending
series of global shockwaves and confrontations between
the world's 'haves' and its 'have-nots'.
106.	The world's super-Powers certainly have their own
contradictions and causes for conflict. However, it would
be a grievous error to attempt to define all of the worlds
present problems in terms of super-Power rivalry. Rivalries between States and even between social systems come
and go. However, the aspirations, goals and dreams of people—all people,
men, women and children—are constant. All want the
same things—-a better life, understanding and respect.
107.	Is there a better institution to address itself to these
aspirations and dreams than the United Nations
We think not. Can the United Nations do so with greater
charity and more effectiveness We think so. Should the
world community continue the investment it has already
made in the United Nations Without doubt. We believe
that the United Nations has already given us all a favourable return and justified its existence many times over.
108.	We must remember that the United Nations is an
outgrowth of the Second World War alliance against the
Axis Powers. As such, the Organization represents an
international alliance against fascism, militarism and
racism.
109.	It was never intended to be, and because of its
nature and the realities of our world it can never effectively be, an alliance against communism any more than it can, or even should, be an alliance against capitalism.
The social and economic system that any country chooses
to live under is a matter that is best left to the people of
that country. This is true regardless of that country's
name, size or location, be it the United States or be it
Nicaragua.
110.	The United Nations has been at its best in heaping
to prevent another world war and in helping promote and
accelerate the process of decolonization. It has been 
a platform for the denunciation of one economic and social system by the proponents of
another. Such crusades are best left to other bodies, as
they seriously hamper and undermine our effectiveness.
It would be wise for all of us to remember that
the world's two foremost Powers are both significant
stronger than the rest of us. Neither one needs any of
us to fight its battles. However, the consequences of any
such fight affects each and every one of us. Therefore,
we have as much of an interest in the rational and reasonable exercise of the tremendous power possessed by
these two great nations as they themselves do.
112. Our search, therefore, must be for some common
ground or common denominator on which they and we
can continue our quest for peace, development and survival. Let our children decide the future, but let us ensure
that there will be a future
11. In assessing the current state of the United Nations,
one is reminded of the story of the two Individuals who,
upon looking at the same glass of water, had different
observations. One, the pessimist, observed that the glass
was half empty. The other, the optimist, observed that
the glass was half full. That story applies to any assessment of the United Nations and of world affairs. Yes, there are vexing problems which plague the
acted and seem as If they will never be resolved. IN South Africa and the Middle East a pervasive pattern
of attitudinal and militarised racism has bequeathed a legacy of
intercommunal  strife which at times appears to be immune except by force of arms. In South-East Asia more
than four decades of ceaseless and unremitting warfare
and destruction have left the people and their and devastated. 
In South and Central America, the just and legitimate strivings of people for justice, equality, land, bread
and freedom have been labelled subversive by the despots
who rule every facet of their lives. Fascistic death squads
operate with impunity and include among their victims
defenceless peasants, priests, nuns, teachers and school
children. In the South Pacific, we find most of the worlds
remaining non-self-governing territories, and we find the
part of this world that has faced the greatest exposure
to nuclear tests, with little regard for the safety of human
beings and the environment.
In reaction to those conditions of poverty, disease and illiteracy they have
been forced to endure, the peoples of Africa, Asia and
South and central America and the Caribbean have
themselves begun the process of changing the conditions
of their lives. Naturally, the various peoples of the South
Pacific is also an integral part of this process of change.
It should also came as no surprise that a great many
people from the developed world are also part of this
process of change. Some of them share in our history and
have themselves been cruelty exploited. All of them share
our vision of the future.
At times this process of change has moved forward
quietly and almost imperceptibly. At other times it has
proceeded dramatically with a mighty roar and great
turbulence. In most instances the manner in which the
process proceeded was determined by those who sought
to abort the process of change. 'Power concedes noting
without a demand,' observed Frederick Douglass. 'It
never did, and it never will,' said that great son of Africa,
who with his people helped end legal slavery in the United
States over 100 years ago. Today his words are as prophetic and as meaningful as they were then:
'If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those
who profess to favour freedom, yet deprecate agitation
are men who want crops without ploughing up the
ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning.
They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many
waters.'
Those words should be borne in mind during our deliberations, particularly on those items which seem to remain
on our agenda with no apparent solution in sight.
118.	After so many years, it is not easy to understand
why the people of Palestine cannot return to their homes.
It is difficult to comprehend why South Africa must be
given even more inducements to end its illegal occupation
of Namibia. It is difficult to fathom how rational minds
can treat the neo-fascist regime in Pretoria like a civilized
nation, which it is not, rather than like the outcast and
pariah which it is.
119.	Some have suggested that we, the international
community, have not been patient enough or that we are
not moderate enough in considering these issues and In
framing resolutions on these topics. Others argue quite
convincingly that we have already been too patient and
that we have no right to be any more moderate than we
have been. After all, they say, how patient and how
moderate was the international community four decades
ago in the face of the same fascism, the same militarism
and the same racism that we are counselled to be to
patient with and so moderate towards today
120.	Perhaps there is an argument that can be made for
toning down some of these resolutions. We do not know.
We simply know that we have not yet heard valid reasons
for voting against resolutions that seek to redress valid
grievances.
121. It seems to us that those with publicity proclaim an
intention to embrace South Africa must themselves accept
responsibility for resolutions which criticize such an
embrace. To do otherwise is to suggest that some of us
are above criticism, and certainty our Creator never
intended that any of us think that of ourselves. That
would be the height of arrogance and would undoubtedly
bring down the indignation and the wrath of the Creator.
122. The situations in title Middle East and in southern
Africa is indeed tragic. They are tragic for the victims
who live in those areas and tragic for us, all of mankind,
as well.
123.	For the victims, the people of those areas, our
primary feelings are not feelings of pity, sympathy, soar-
row or pessimism. Towards them, our primary feelings
are feelings of support, solidarity, encouragement and
optimism. To them we are grateful, for they renew in all
of us the very best of human qualities. Our pity, our
sympathy and our sorrow are reserved for those people
who choose to remain on the side-lines, passively accepting, or for those who tragically imitate Israel
and South Africa in other regions.
124.	Indonesia is a country which we have long admired
and respected. It is a country which by its actions helped
inspire the decolonization process and tater became a
founder of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. It
is a large and powerful country which we consider a
friend.
125.	Although Vanuatu is Indonesia's friend, we also
realize that a true friend is not one who tells another
simply what he wishes to hear. Difficult as It may be, a
true friend must on occasion be painfully honest and tell
a friend what that friend may not wish to hear. Such is
the case with respect to Indonesia's Invasion, occupation
and attempted annexation of East Timor.
126.	East Timor is another small South Pacific country,
like our own. Its people fought on the side of the Allies
during the Second World War and paid dearly for their
commitment to what became the Ideals of the United
Nations. Like more than two thirds of the nations represented here today, the people of East Timor saw the post-war era as the time to re-assert their own political and
social independence. Tragically, Indonesia's military
rulers interrupted East Timor's decolonization process as
that process was in its final stages.
127.	The resulting brutalization of East Timor's people
has also brutalized Indonesia's image as a nation. How
can one so large justify such heavy-handed repression of
a small neighbour. Hundreds of thousands of Innocent men,
women and children had to nay with their lives and so
many mote are still paying of sudden disappearances,
detention without explanation, and torture. Why has
every effort to provide even the minimum humanitarian
assistance to the beleaguered people of East Timor been
thwarted by the Indonesian authorities?
Certainly, no rational person would suggest that
there is an acceptable double standard on questions of
colonization, colonialism and human rights. Where is it written 
that colonialism is wrong only when the colonial 
Power Is a European nation?  Where is it written that the
systematic denial of fundamental human rights, including
the very right to life itself, is evil only when the violator
happens to be a European nation?
129.	If we accept Indonesia's actions in East Timor,
then with what legal authority do we challenge Israel's
annexation of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights?  If we
accept Indonesia's brutality in East Timor, then with what
moral authority do we challenge apartheid?  If we, the
former colonies of the world are not true to our own
pronouncements on colonialism and human rights when
it comes to East Timor, then we have not yet reed ourselves from the old discredited values of those who called themselves our masters.
130.	It is not easy, nor is it a pleasant experience, to
be compelled to focus so critically upon the actions of
a country which was once a mode and an inspiration to
our Own people and others who were colonized. It is,
however, more difficult and less pleasant to bear witness
to what has been done to the people of East Timor. It
is also difficult to comprehend the more bankruptcy of
those who speak so eloquently on other matters, but who
remain silent on the question of East Timor.
131.	We as a nation are not cynical enough to have
interests which would lead us to close our eyes to the
injustices imposed on our fetor human beings in East
Timor. Were we to acquiesce in Indonesia's actions, we
would not be true to the Charter of the United Nations
nor to ourselves, or to our children and the future we
would bequeath to them.
132.	We are reminded of an important directive issued
during the struggle to free Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verge
from colonial domination: 'Hide nothing from the
masses of the people. Tell no ties, claim no easy victories.' Those words are as appropriate here In this chamber today as they were in West Africa in 1968.
133.	We, therefore, once again appeal to Indonesia to
save its soul as a nation and to be true to its heritage
and stature by negotiating a speedy and complete withdrawal of its forces from East Timor. Let the people of
that country decides their own fate, and let the United
Nations assist in that process. This is why we have a
United Nations.
134.	New Caledonia is another non-self-governing territory in the South Pacific and another example of why
we have the Organization. It is also another matter which
coils for us, the International community, to 'tell no lies,
claim no victories'.
135.	New Caledonia is the world's second largest producer of niece. Therefore, the struggle by Its people to
gain their independence has posed and undoubtedly will
continue to pose a second question: who will control the
enormous economic potential of this small developing
country
136.	Without a doubt, all of us here today are well
aware of the role that economics played In the colonization of most of the world. We are also certainly aware
of the fact that it is the mineral wealth of Namibia and
of South Africa that lies behind the complicated political
web spun by those who do not wish to see the people of
those countries control their own resources. New Caledonia's people face similar obstacles for the same reasons.
137.	In New Caledonia, as In southern Africa, the settler
population usually acts contrary to the Interests of the
indigenous population. This the world understands and
has come to expect.
138.	What is less well understood, however, Is that the
settler population, having its own narrow and specific
Interests to protect, often acts contrary as well to the
broader Interests of the metropolitan Power. Such became the ease in Algeria and in Zimbabwe; such Is the
case in Namibia and In South Africa; and such is the ease
in New Caledonia.
139.	Generally speaking, metropolitan Powers do not
have a direct interest in the maintenance of rigid and
exclusionary social codes which hamper economic growth
and development. This is particularly true when those
social codes, by whatever name they are called, are operable far from the physical environs of the metropolitan Power. Thus, apartheid, or segregation, comes to be seen
as outmoded, unnecessary and even threatening to the
broader, more general economic interests of the metropolitan Power. Eventually, the metropolitan Power may,
for its own purposes, even seek to appear to be paying
a leading role in ending a particularly odious social code.
140.	Naturally, none of this occurs overnight. It takes
time for the contradiction to arise, more time for it to
be recognized, art even mere time for the effort to
reconcile it to be put into operation, in the meantime,
those who have been victims of the social code usually
have begun their own process of change. Generality speaking, wit they have in mind is a more far-reaching and
fundamental change.
The metropolitan Power then faces a dilemma. On
the one hand, it is in a sense captive to a restive and
obstinate stir population. On the other hand, it finally
reaches toast its tong-term interests are best served by
making a more reasonable and rational accommodation
with the indigenous population. its main preoccupation
now becomes how to buy itself sufficient time to make
the necessary accommodation and how to balance the
competing antagonisms of the settlers and the indigenous
population.
142.	In this respect New Caledonia differs from South
Africa primarily in the nature of the metropolitan Power.
South Africa no longer has one easily identifiable metropolitan Power. France, on the other hand, is dearly
the identifiable metropolitan Power which both the setters and the indigenous population now petition.
143.	New Caledonia is similar to South Africa in the
hardened racial attitudes of some of its European settlers.
To them, the indigenous Kayak population is not worthy
of the basic and elementary dignity, respect and legal
 rights that most human beings are now able to take for
granted.  
The people of New Caledonia have extended a
warm and open hand of friendship to all who would work
together in a free and independent nation. Theirs is a
vision of a non-exclusionary South Pacific nation in
which all human beings would be treated as equals.
145.	We believe that the Government of France is sincerely searching for answers to the questions raised concerning New Caledonia's future. The reforms that France
has introduced have certainty helped, and they demonstrate a sincere commitment to an effort to and some
common ground upon which the competing interests may
be framed.
The South Pacific Forum, at its meeting at Canberra on 29 and 30 August, took note of France's efforts
in this regard. However, we, the South Pacific heads of
Government, also declared our support for independence for New Caledonia, and we urged the French
to consider, in conducting an act of self-determination, the desirability of excluding from the
short-term or non-permanent residents of New
Caledonia. This is in recognition of the fact that to be
the exercise of self-determination must be by the
of a particular country themselves, and those who
have not even lived there but have been brought there
and permitted to vote m order to outweigh the wishes of
the legitimate population must not take part, in its totality, the Canberra communiqué supports the right of self-determination. It urges the various sectors of the nation to work closely with France to ensure a peaceful transition to independence. It is laudable in its aims and
practical it its approach, including the decision to review
the situation next year and to consider the desirability of
re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations
list of non-self-governing territories.
147. The Vanuatu Government is confident that New
Caledonia will soon  assume its rightful place as an independent nation. Toward that end, we urge Members of the United Nations to keep themselves apprised of
the situation in this economically important tend and to
support the initiatives of New Caledonia's people, as have
the Governments of the South Pacific.
148.	We in the South Pacific have another major preoccupation, in addition to our concern for the remaining
non-self-covering territories in our area. All our Governments, including those of Australia and New Zealand,
have taken strong stands against nuclear testing in our
area.
149.	The peoples of the Pacific have always respected
and been at peace with their environment. To us, our
lands, our skies and our ocean have always been a source
of spiritual guidance as we as a means of sustaining life. Others have now come to our area to conduct tests,
store material and dump wastes that would not be tolerated in their own waters and on their own tends. Despite
the strong representation of all Governments in the area,
this reckless disregard for human life and the environment
continues almost unabated. Our opposition is based on
moral as well as scientific grounds, invitations by France
or by any other nuclear Power to visit test sites wit never
reduce the strength of our moral objections. We, the
people of the South Pacific, have made it clear that we
want an immediate end to the testing of any and ail
nuclear weapons in our region.
It is for this reason that our Government supports
proposals for the establishment of a nuclear-free Pacific.
This past July we were proud to host an international
conference on a nuclear-free and independent Pacific. To
all but the most myopic observer, it is clear that the two
go hand in hand; indeed, we submit that it will in fact
be difficult to achieve a nuclear-free Pacific until there
is an independent Pacific and until the respective peoples
of the area are free to decide for themselves whether this
defilement of our land, sea and air shall continue.
152. Economic development in the South Pacific is a
difficult and somewhat elusive goal. Some of our count-
tries are blessed with abundant mineral resources, seem
with abundant agricultural resources, and others with
neither. Most are under populated. All are separated by
many miles of ocean, mass communications and transportation are major problems. 
Finally, this latter character: exacerbates our present state of underdevelopment
and preoccupies us all.
For these reasons, the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea is so important. It is our
hope that someday this Convention will be acclaimed and unanimously accepted, as it has already
been by an overwhelming majority of our neighbour.
Being a stall island State ourselves, we support
the concerns of other such States that their territorial
integrity be respected and preserved. We too have a
territorial dispute with a major Power. We hope that
France will in good faith negotiate an accept
with us and that the islands of Matthew and Hunter will
once again be administered as part of our country, which
they are.
Both the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and
the United Nations have begun to focus on the unique
problems of small island developing States. The recently
concluded conference of experts hosted by the Government of Grenada is a very positive step in the right direction. it is our hope that the work of the conference can
continue and deceive the support of the entire international community.
156. We recognize that the problems of small Islands
developing States are only one of a host of economic
problems plaguing the world today. The depressed state
of the world economy, with the universal phenomenon
of international inflationary pressures, is a major concern The need for international monetary reform and
the expansion of international trade is well documented.
The twin needs of greater North-South dialogue and
greater South-South economic trade and co-operation are
also well known. So many major economic problems
confront us today that one hardly knows where and how
to begin cataloguing them.
157.	The resolution of these problems is going to necessitate a serious and long-term commitment by each of us.
Perhaps it will be painful, but we should probably begin
with critical self-examinations of our respective histories,
policies and priorities.
158.	None of us is perfect, large or small, developed
or developing. Those who pontificate and preach to us
that we must follow the same path of development that
they followed understand neither history nor economics.
The world is different today from what it was 200 years
ago, or even 20 years ago, and our objective conditions
are certainly different. Modern technology has rendered
obsolete much of what we learned and have dramatically
increased the gap between those nations which 'have'
and those which 'have not'.
159.	No nation today has the luxury of developing in
isolation, at its own pace. Radio, films, television, books,
newspapers and magazines all bring the affluent world
to the attention of the citizens of all countries. Very few
Governments exist today which can resist the attendant
pressures to bring that or a comparable good life to its
own citizens.
160.	Wealth that was created, at least in part, as a direct
consequence of legalized slavery, colonialism and the
theft of other people's natural resources is inaccurately
portrayed as resulting solely from the hard work and
natural intelligence of those who came to possess that
wealth.
161.	It is not at all possible or even desirable for us to
develop our countries by rigid imitations of the West or
the East. We cannot isolate ourselves, but we most certainly can develop our own methodology and our own
healthy economy and social mix. We certainly do not have
the option of salting to distant shores and stealing land
or having people to labour for us. as others have in the
past. Even if that option were available, it is not the way
we would choose to develop. While we do not live in the
past, we most certainly remember our shared history.
162.	This is not to suggest for one moment that things
today are as one-sided as we might like to believe. We,
the developing countries are also imperfect. Some of us
have neglected to practise what we preached. Some are
afraid to be candid in assessing our own performances,
as if our adversaries and friends did not already know
where we have fallen short. Some continue to make
capital mistakes; others among us continue tic make soda
mistakes. Some manage to make both.
163.	For us to begin to take corrective action, we must
first be true to ourselves. For us to be taken seriously,
we must first take ourselves seriously. We will undoubtedly command as much respect as we demand by our own
efforts, our own consistency and, most importantly, our
own sacrifices, personal and institutional
164.	Now more than ever we must respect the universality of mankind and plan for the future. There are
literally dozens of pressing problems confronting the
international community today. Bach successive crisis
seems to overshadow the previous one.
165.	Perhaps none in recent memory was as dramatic
as the downing of the Korean Air Lines flight 007. Few
incidents have captured the public's attention as that did.
Few incidents have as dramatically pointed to the need
for better communication and understanding and for the
strengthening of the United Nations. There is no doubt
that 269 people lost their lives needlessly. This in itself
is a great human tragedy, and we convey our very deepest
condolences to the families and friends of the victims.
166.	We do not know if the world will ever know what
events really led up to this tragedy and what really happened just before the aircraft was shot down. It Is possible
that both sides are telling the truth as they perceive the
truth to be. We do not know.
167.	We do not believe there can ever be any justification for shooting down a civilian aircraft, except perhaps
in the extremely remote possibility of averting a far
greater immediate human disaster. We believe that the
Soviet Union made a tragic mistake and inexplicably
compounded the mistake in its immediate aftermath.
168.	However, we do not believe that blame or guilt in
this instance lies with any one nation. This was a tragedy
for all mankind and not just for any one State or group
of States, it proves nothing about any particular social
or economic system. This was a failure by mankind, all
mankind, it reveals the heightened sense of international
insecurity that the arms race, cold war rhetoric and tests
of military preparedness have brought us.
169.	This tragedy tells us that the technology of destruction is far more advanced than is the technology of
communication and the technology of the prevention of
destruction. n the normal course of events, we would
learn from such a tragedy and develop more effective
safeguards to prevent a recurrence. Unfortunately this
does not appear to be the ease, and this is even more of
a tragedy.
170.	It saddens and concerns us to see the international
atmosphere further poisoned by hatred and recriminate-
tons. Now more than ever, the world cries out for the
leadership of wise statement. Where are the leaders with
the wisdom and the courage to say, 'Let us sit down and
reason together', to say, 'Let us make sure this does
not happen again', to say, 'Let us put an end to the
suspicions and distrust which gave rise to this incident'
17. Why are those who were silent when a Libyan
airliner was shot down by Israeli fighters so vocal and
articulate now Why are those who were silent when a
Cuban airliner was blown out of the sky by a terrorist
bomb so morally outraged now All human life is sacred,
and none is more sacred than another. The lives of East
Timorese and Vietnamese are sacred. The lives of Pays-
Tinian’s and Lebanese are sacred. The lives of Iranians and
[raise are sacred. The lives of Chileans and Filipinos are
sacred. The lives of Cypriots and Guatemalans are sacred.
Without exception the loss of any human life is a tragedy.
The number of victims or their nationality does not make
the tragedy any worse or deepen our sorrow. Those who
stress the individual aspects of human rights should
understand this better than anyone.
172.	Why are those who are so willing to isolate the
Soviet Union so unwilling to isolate South Africa Why
is it vital to keep channels of communication open to
South Africa, but not to the Soviet Union Why is South
Africa considered a civilized State, but not the Soviet
Union
173.	Ours is a smelt country, and admittedly we do not
know the answer to every question. However, there are
many things we are certain of. One certainty is that those
who ally themselves with the evil practitioners of apartheid
or other forms of racism cannot complain to us when
others move into the moral vacuum they themselves have
created. To them we say 'If we are to believe in your
moral superiority, it is time for you to demonstrate it in
southern Africa, in East Timor, in the Middle East, in
central America and in other parts of our troubled
globe'.
174. For emphasis, we wit repeat and stress again and
again that both the Soviet Union and the United States
are very big and very powerful countries. Neither need
Vanuatu or any other country to fight its betties, and
certainty not the battle between these two giants. However. as human beings, we have a great deal at stake.
75. We do not want these two great Powers to fight
unless they limit their weapons to their respective moray
strengths and their powers of persuasion. We have as
much to lose as they do, should tidy insist on fighting
with military weapons. We cannot stop them, but we can
and do try to urge caution and restraint. The only weapons we have at our disposal are truth, our faith in
mankind and our own powers of pet suasion.
 76. We now papacy to either country to step forward
and, in the name of humanity, say 'We have all had
enough of this madness'. Let one begin by dismantling
one weapon and it the other folio suit by dismantling
another. Which one begins the process is no longer important, just as which one began to stockpile the weapons
is no longer important.
The people of both the Soviet Union and the
United States, along with the people of many other
countries, made tremendous sacrifices four decades ago
which led to the creation of the United Nations. Now it
is time for one more enormous sacrifice It is still not too
late.
178.	The entire world is waiting for us, all of us, to
move forward in the name of the human race. Now each
nation represented here today must ask itself whether it
wishes to be part of the problem or to be part of the
solution.
 



"
3315,38,1983,NZL,"﻿266.	 Sir, may I begin by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. This is an appropriate recognition both of your own personal achievements and of the important role your country is playing in international affairs. New Zealand will fully support you in your endeavour to make this session a productive one, just as we fully support the Secretary-General in his efforts to make the United Nations more effective in the search for peace and development.
267.	Less than two weeks ago I had the pleasure of representing New Zealand at the independence celebrations of the new State of Saint Christopher and Nevis. Today I join others in congratulating the international community's newest Member in being represented for the first time at the United Nations. It is a salutary reminder to us all that one of the first acts of such a young and small country has been to register, in a formal sense, its interest in this Organization. We in New Zealand have no difficulty understanding that. By most counts, we are ourselves a young and small country. Our welfare can be profoundly influenced for better or worse by external developments very largely outside our control. Some four decades ago, when the Charter of the United Nations was negotiated, we held high hopes that through international co-operation we would achieve a measure of political and economic security which a country like New Zealand could not hope to realize alone.
268.	Time and experience have tempered our earlier expectations. In recent years we have seen the Soviet Union invade Afghanistan in flagrant violation of the Charter. Similarly, the invasion of Kampuchea by Viet Nam has been followed by nearly five years of occupation, thereby preventing the political settlement that the Assembly has urged repeatedly. The essential character of the apartheid system remains intact, in spite of the strongest condemnation by the international community. Day by day we witness the continuing suffering of various peoples and countries in the Middle East, indicating to us once more that peace and security cannot be achieved by force of arms alone. In one of those areas of conflict- Lebanon—New Zealand welcomes the cease-fire and hopes that it paves the way for a more lasting settlement among the parties involved.
269.	The Antarctic region stands in sharp contrast to these troubled areas throughout the world. For over 20 years the Antarctic Treaty' has succeeded in making Antarctica an area of international co-operation and preventing it from becoming the object of international dissension. The Treaty is open to any Member of the United Nations and it remains in force indefinitely. It makes a very effective contribution to achieving the purposes of the United Nations. We assume that any study carried out by the Organization will fully recognize this fact and seek to reinforce the Treaty rather than to weaken it.
270.	Antarctica is one example of what can be achieved by practical international co-operation. The South Pacific is another. At least once a year the heads of all the independent Governments in our region meet together in the South Pacific Forum to talk over common problems and to work out ways of dealing with them. So far we have succeeded in keeping our part of the world peaceful. We are, however, concerned about the continuation of nuclear testing in the South Pacific. We appreciate the offer made by the French Government to allow qualified experts from countries in the area to visit the testing site and check the effectiveness of the safety precautions followed by the French authorities. But the question is not merely one of safety precautions; it is about the use of a relatively peaceful part of the world for an essentially warlike purpose.
271.	We realize that this problem cannot be dealt with on a purely regional basis, and that is why New Zealand, like other countries in the South Pacific and elsewhere, attaches great importance to the negotiation of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. To be effective, such a treaty would need to be fully verifiable. Given good will and effort on all sides, we believe this problem can be overcome. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty would do much to strengthen the 1968 Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to limit the nuclear arms race.
272.	The part of the world in which New Zealanders live is one of the few areas of relative tranquillity. Nevertheless we are from time to time sharply reminded of the limitations both of international law and of normally accepted standards of civilized behaviour. The ruthless and totally unjustified attack by the Soviet Union on a civilian airliner has provided such a reminder. The Soviet Union must accept full responsibility for this act of brutality. What is truly outrageous is that the Soviet Government claims this action was fully in accordance with Soviet law. In plain language they seem to be saying that if tomorrow a civilian airliner from any one of our countries mistakenly flew over Soviet territory then they reserve the right to shoot it down.
273.	The limits to international co-operation are thus plain—all to plain—to see, yet the membership of the United Nations remains intact, and we welcome to the fold a new Member from the Caribbean region.
274.	The reason, I suggest, is obvious. However difficult it has been to develop habits of international cooperation on these major political issues, there is no practical alternative for the overwhelming majority of countries.
275.	I believe that today this applies with equal force to the international economy. International economic linkages are such that in practical terms no single country any longer has freedom of action. That is the consequence of several decades of sustained growth in world trade, production and investment. The interdependent world economy has arrived on our doorsteps, and the world has little idea how to manage it.
276.	The theory behind economic interdependence is not new. We always knew that the health of any individual economy was linked in no small measure with the health of its major trading and investment partners. There is nothing novel in pointing to the close connections between, say, trade and financial flows.
277.	What is new is that the practical significance of those linkages has increased to such an extent and with such rapidity that we have failed to adapt sufficiently our institutions and our thinking so as to be able to cope with those linkages.
278.	New Zealand respects the competence of the principal economic institutions such as IMF, the World Bank and GATT. As originally conceived after the war, they each had their role—IMF was concerned principally with short-term balance of payment adjustment and maintaining exchange rate stability, the Bank was concerned with development and GATT dealt with trade.
279.	The growth of interdependence has totally blurred these tidy dividing lines. The long-term resolution of the debt burden built up over recent years is inextricably linked with the resolution of the problems of protectionism. The old phrase that debt is deferred trade sums up the reality that it is only through increased exports that the interest and principal repayments can ever be met.
If protectionism chokes off that possibility, then the debt problem assumes very different proportions.
280.	It is not just a question of interdependence between issues such as debt and trade, development and growth. It is also a question of the interdependence between countries, between regions, between North and South.
281.	The current economic crisis facing many less developed countries has obscured the fact that until recently the growth performance of many of those countries was particularly strong. It has been estimated that in the 25-year period 1950 to 1975 the per capita gross Rational product of the developing countries as a whole grew at an average rate of 3.5 per cent per annum. Even though we knew this left a number of countries with unacceptable levels of poverty, this was a remarkable historic achievement. It was matched by creditable progress in such crucial indices as a steady rise in life expectancy and adult literacy.
282.	Because of these developments it was clear by the beginning of the 1980s that it was no longer accurate to see the concept of dependence flowing one way only. By the 1980s the economic health of developed countries was beginning to be influenced profoundly by the economic performance of their less developed neighbours.
283.	This is what interdependence means. It was visibly demonstrated last year when the expected recovery of the developed and affluent countries members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OFCD] did not eventuate in the second half of 1982 very largely because of a sudden downturn in the demand for their exports to the less developed world. Faced with acute financing difficulties caused by a contraction in commercial bank lending, many of the more heavily indebted countries had no option but to pursue adjustment policies based largely on slashing imports. This impaired their own development needs. It impaired the OECD's recovery.
284.	From the suffering of the Second World War a system for international economic co-operation was developed. Those who designed that system had in mind a world economy that was very different from the interdependent world economy we live in today. In many respects those post-war arrangements achieved their central objectives. Many of the key elements, such as currency convertibility, are still as relevant today as they were then. The successes of that system of trade and payments created the global economy we have today. I believe the international community must now move on to the next phase of international economic co-operation and begin the task of managing that interdependence.
285.	To describe the scope and magnitude of that task I have used the term 'a new Bretton Woods'. For over a year, at a variety of international forums, I have urged the international community to initiate the comprehensive examination of the world's trade and payments system that is the first necessary step towards a new Bretton Woods. The conference as such should be regarded as the last step, the culmination of the most careful preparatory process of analysis and discussion.
286.	During that time there has been considerable debate over the future of the trade and payments system. There have also been unmistakable signs of a recovery in the United States economy, and the immediate danger of default by the most heavily indebted countries has been averted by various rescue operations.
287.	The key question, I believe, is whether the recovery and these rescue operations will in practice set back the growing consensus in favour of a comprehensive examination of the underlying structural difficulties facing the world economy. There is a serious danger that this will be the case. The remedy, however, lies entirely in our own hands.
288.	Let me first summarize the international debate as I believe it has evolved over that period. In February 1983 the Brandt Commission's second report proposed a major review of the world's trade and payments system.' In March the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries endorsed the Indian Prime Minister's call for a conference on money and finance for development. Following the meeting of OECD ministers in May, at which I repeated my call for a Bretton Woods-type conference, the French President made a very similar proposal. Then, at the Williamsburg Summit the leaders of the industrialized countries issued a somewhat tentative call for their ministers of finance to work with the Managing Director of IMF to prepare the groundwork for what might develop into a high-level international monetary conference. However qualified that endorsement may have been, it was a response from the developed world to the growing weight of opinion favouring a careful examination of these international economic issues. The middle ground, if not clearly delineated, was at least becoming visible.
289.	Finally, at the meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers, which concluded in Trinidad and Tobago less than two weeks ago, ministers of finance from 44 countries, representing the diversity of wealth, population and size that is the key characteristic of that grouping, commended the general thrust of a major report entitled 'Towards a New Bretton Woods'.
290.	This was a report compiled by eminent experts from nine Commonwealth countries. Its work on conditionally, liquidity problems, the role of special drawing rights, protectionism and sovereign debt, to mention only a few of the issues covered in the report, will, I hope, be sifted and refined. As the first attempt by an international institution to outline the agenda for such a fundamental examination of the trade and payments system, it deserves careful consideration by the wider international community.
291.	Surveying the debate over the past 12 months as a whole, therefore, international opinion seems to have been evolving in a promising direction. We were beginning to move away from the sterile confrontations that have been the hallmark of international economic debate even in recent years.
292.	However, we now face the possibility that the recovery—welcome as it is—may have the somewhat predictable result of unravelling a good deal of that growing consensus. If the international community has been increasingly ready to consider the scope for changes to the trade and payments system, it has no doubt been due to the long period of stagflation we have been through. Equally, now that the first clear signs of a recovery in the United States and certain other industrial economies are evident, some of the pressure to examine these long- term issues is off. It may be only realistic to expect that debate to be influenced by short-term fluctuation in the real economy. It would, I suggest, be reasonable to expect a little more vision.
293.	In spite of the misgivings of many Governors and the continuing, though privately expressed, disquiet of the international banking community, a message to emerge from the annual meetings of IMF and the World Bank was, regrettably, all too clear. With some of the major industrial countries there was a mood that can be expressed quite simply: now that the recovery is under way, let us put aside all this talk of changes to the trade and payments system.
294.	I believe that view is more than short-sighted; it is tragically misplaced. The recovery of industrial countries, in itself undoubtedly the best piece of economic news we have had for some years, will not come to grips with the deep-seated changes that have occurred in the world economy since the formation of the Bretton Woods institutions.
295.	In 1982 the world economy went backwards. World production declined by an estimated 2 per cent, and the volume of world trade declined by 2.5 per cent. Had this continued into 1983 I believe it would have put nearly impossible strains on world economic and political stability. The recovery certain developed countries are now experiencing has to be seen against that perspective. It has turned the tide against the forces of contraction of world output and trade unprecedented in our post-war experience. The recovery in demand will strengthen many commodity prices and thus may offer some relief to those countries which, like New Zealand, have suffered disastrous declines in their terms of trade during the last decade. Finally, however, the recovery is not a panacea for the problems of debt, protectionism and development.
296.	In the first place the recovery is cyclical in nature and confined to relatively few countries. Even for them the persistence of high interest rates is a serious threat to sustained recovery of their economies.
297.	Recovery will not tackle the underlying roots of protectionism, since clearly, the growth of protectionist action predates the recession. Protectionism, which is by no means confined to the OECD countries, will persist in the developed world if only because no one is predicting growth rates which will reduce the number of unemployed, roughly 35 million, in the OECD area.
298.	Recovery will not do much to alleviate the debt burdens of many developing countries. The Commonwealth study 'Towards a New Bretton Woods' estimates that there are as many as 40 countries which have been reported to have agreed to debt reschedulings or to be in substantial payments arrears. In the 10-month period to June 1983 the value of cross-border debt being renegotiated with commercial banks has been calculated as being over 20 times larger than in any previous year. Debt of this magnitude is a powerful force for uncertainty, a threat to the recovery and a source of instability for these Governments, whatever their political system.
299.	Nor can I see any reason why the recovery should reverse the mood—so obvious in most countries—which has been aptly described as 'aid weariness'. The New Zealand political system is no more immune to that than any other democratic country. However, my experience with our small but highly effective aid programmes in the independent countries of the South Pacific has convinced me that the prevailing modem view of aid is profoundly misplaced.
300.	I have advocated putting aid on a firmer basis, possibly by issuing special drawing rights to the countries in greatest need. In any such distribution there may be a useful role for the World Bank, in part because that would put the Bank's finances on a more assured basis.
301.	These are only some of the medium- and longer- term issues which I believe the modest recovery in the OECD area will do little to address.
302.	The ideas, the issues involved, although technical in nature, have profound political implications. Many countries represented in the Assembly have witnessed directly the political consequences that flow from economic dislocation. Economic growth and stable financial markets will not of themselves preserve the fabric of world peace, but they are powerful positive forces all the same. Many of the elements of the post-war system of economic co-operation are under strain. I believe we, as an international community, now need to develop new political levers to tackle some of the underlying difficulties. We must move beyond the ad hoc responses that have developed to cope with severe, long-term current account deficits. We must reassure heavily indebted countries that there will be adequate financing available while they pursue the long-term process of structural adjustment. The original political mandate of GATT, which is now all but exhausted, must be renewed.
303.	The difficulty in all this is to move beyond general expressions of concern to initiate a process which might come to grips with some of these fundamental issues facing the world trade and payments system.
304.	Of course, if the complacent mood prevalent in some countries persists there is little that can be done. In that case, the middle ground that I believe was becoming visible until very recently will quickly disappear. We will quit the field and leave it to extremists of varying points of view. We will return to the dubious pleasure of the sterile confrontations of past years.
305.	I do not pretend to have a blueprint for the process that might lead to a comprehensive examination of the trade and payments system. There are many possible approaches, involving different timetables and different combinations of people and institutions. The study 'Towards a new Bretton Woods', to which I referred earlier, has one such proposal worthy of the Assembly's consideration. Ultimately, the process must be tailored to the needs of the main participants so as to command their support.
306.	It is not hard, however, to describe in general terms the criteria for a successful examination of the trade and payments system.
307.	First, the basic work must be undertaken by experts of the highest standing, otherwise its analytical competence would be subject to easy and probably fatal challenge.
308.	Secondly, these experts must enjoy the confidence of major Governments and have ready access to their political advice. In that way, we might avoid proposals that are completely outside the limits of political possibility.
309.	Thirdly, any such group must be of manageable size. In my view this implies a small group of around 15 to 25 members broadly representative of the international community and working closely with the major international economic institutions. We would probably end up with something analogous to the structure of the Interim Committee and the Executive Board of IMF. Unlike the Interim Committee, however, it would be concerned with all the fundamental long-term trade and payments issues, rather than simply determining the current policy of IMF.
310.	Fourthly, a conference, involving participation on a far wider international basis, should be seen as a conclusion rather than a beginning. The Commonwealth finance ministers saw a Bretton Woods-type conference in this context very much as an end to the process rather than a commencement.
311.	It is more difficult to be definitive about the timetable when agreement on the process described above still escapes our grasp. I believe there is an urgent need to begin the task now, and I believe that the general proposition has wide support. If we accept the projections which imply an annual rate of growth in the key industrial countries of 3 to 4 per cent into 1984, then this gives us some flexibility to implement any changes agreed at what we might call the study group level. If we delay the start of our examination too long, then we face the possibility of yet another cyclical downturn in the world economy. A return to an even less auspicious macro-economic climate could sound the death-knell to the implementation stage of the exercise.
312.	The point requires no labouring. There is a real and pressing need to get on with the job of re-examining the system and working out how to adapt it to the needs of the period we live in. Delay is dangerous. To avert the threat, we should aim to have broad international agreement to implementing changes in the trade and payments system by, say, 1985. The process of preparing for it should begin straight away, certainly by the beginning of 1984. The time for action is now.
 




"
3327,34,1979,AUS,"﻿It gives me particular pleasure to address the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly, meeting as it is under the presidency of Ambassador Salim. The Australian Government and successive Australian representatives to the United Nations have known his capacity, his energy and the vitality of his ideas, assets which we are confident he will be able to employ in the coming year for the benefit of the Organization as a whole. Australia's membership in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, in particular, has provided us with the privilege of co-operating closely with him in the important work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization. Through this work Australia and the United Republic of Tanzania continue to demonstrate a mutual concern to extend basic human rights to all peoples. My delegation offers him its full co-operation in discharging his many responsibilities as President of the General Assembly.
199.	It is always a pleasure to welcome new Members to this- Organization and, on behalf of the Australian Government, I was happy to become a sponsor of the admission of Saint Lucia, a fellow Commonwealth country.
200.	The end of a decade is an occasion for reflection and for the drawing up of balance-sheets. In many respects the 1970s marked a turning-point in international affairs. It was a decade in which many of the assumptions of the past were found to be inadequate. The international agenda has been drastically altered and new issues have come to the fore.
201.	Energy problems emerged as one of our most serious concerns. Demands for the establishment of a more efficient and more equitable international economic order have been among the more compelling pressures for change. International concern to limit the catastrophic potential of the arms race has continued unabated. Particular emphasis has been given to human rights and the issues of social justice.
202.	These issues will also dominate the agenda of the 1980s. However, whereas in the 1970s we began to grasp and to adjust to the changing realities involved, in the 1980s we will face the daunting task of finding solutions.
203.	As we move into the 1980s it would be reckless to ignore the difficulties which now cloud prospects for global economic growth. It would be reckless and inhumane to overlook the fact that some 800 million people in the developing world still live in absolute poverty.
204.	The challenge we now face is that after some 25 years of unprecedented growth—a process in which many developing countries shared—the economies of most countries are now faltering. Steady rates of growth have been broken and governments are hard- pressed to restore them to the previous levels. Growth in trade, which had been running at 8 per cent in the 1950s and the 1960s has fallen by half. Inflation, unemployment and protectionist measures have emerged as major problems for the developed market-economy countries. This has had serious consequences for the developing countries. Australia has shared these problems, understands their impact on developing countries and is committed to their resolution.
205.	The international community must face these problems squarely. We must not shrink from the responsibilities we all share. Next year's special session of the General Assembly will provide a major opportunity to come to grips with the constraints on growth to which I have referred, and that opportunity must be grasped.
206.	We expect the special session to undertake a thoroughgoing assessment of the lessons of the 1970s and to initiate a bold and imaginative response to the challenges of the 1980s. That response must entail a renewed interest in a more efficient and more equitable international economic order.
207.	The international development strategy for the third development decade will be a particularly important matter for the special session. We owe it to our own people to ensure that the special session produces a practical and action-oriented strategy. Ways of giving impetus to the real factors of growth must be found. The strategy must identify national efforts and commitments and clearly establish objectives in relation to economic and social development. Above all, it must present realistic ways in which all countries can work for the achievement of these objectives.
208.	Australia, for its part, has been taking stock of how these relationships, and in particular the North- South dialogue, can be made more productive. This has been the basic concern behind our practical approaches at the fifth session of UNCTAD and our initiative at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries meeting in Lusaka to have a study made of constraints on growth. The stalemate in the present dialogue must be broken.
209.	Australia has considered carefully the proposals put forward to launch global negotiations in the United Nations, open to all Members, in certain important areas which are central to the North-South dialogue. We are prepared to accept in principle the proposals for global negotiations. This is on the understanding that the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 will be able to draw up a programme for negotiations setting out, in an acceptable form, the priorities and the modalities for the negotiations and their relationship with ongoing negotiations on these issues in other forums. We would want to be sure that the projected global interrelated negotiations should be carefully approached so as to ensure, as far as possible, practical progress on the complex issues involved. Such progress will inevitably come by stages and not necessarily in an interlocked, interwoven fashion. We must seek to move forward wherever we can, and some areas will of course be more susceptible to forward movement than others. We are naturally concerned, in particular, that the opening of any global negotiations on a wide range of interrelated issues should not hold up ongoing negotiation on them in other more specialized forums—for example, in UNCTAD on the Common Fund and on international commodity agreements.
210.	In addressing the constraints on growth, my Government has put special emphasis on the current high levels of inflation, with its damaging effects on development, on employment, on exchange rates and on trade flows. Unless controlled, inflation brings in its wake economic disruption and social disintegration. Its worst effects weigh most heavily on the poorest members of our communities.
211.	The failure of many developed countries to control domestic inflation has unquestionably had a severely adverse impact on developing countries, which look to the developed world as the market for 70 per cent of their exports and as the major source of capital and development assistance. Sound anti-inflationary 
policies—a necessity if we are to achieve sustained economic growth—must be adopted by all countries.
212.	There is, I believe, a fundamental link between inflation, protectionism and the relative lack of progress in structural adjustment in many of our economies. Higher inflation rates have led to defensive protectionist policies. Such policies bring with them distortions through misallocation and inefficient use of labour and capital. They frequently involve wage and export subsidies and supports, instead of positive adjustment measures. They lead to efforts in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to maintain inefficient and unproductive operations and obsolescent industries.
213.	The task of dismantling protectionist measures is quite formidable; adjustment cannot be instantaneous. But we should not be deflected by narrow sectional interests. We must recognize that adjustment measures also open up new opportunities.
214.	In Australia's view the developing countries must be given greater access to world markets for their exports. Only last week my Government announced a new series of initiatives aimed at improving the developing countries' share of Australian trade. These measures include the further expansion of the Australian system of tariff preferences.
215.	A significant number of developing countries— several of them in Australia's region—have now emerged as important exporters of manufactures and services. The increasing diversification of those countries' economies and their movements away from import-substitution strategies have laid a basis for large-scale expansion of output and increasing trade specialization. While this development presents a major competitive challenge to the industries of many developed countries, there are also substantial opportunities mixed in with it. We should all be seeking to associate ourselves with their growth and together aim to share the benefits of the expanding trade flows that they are generating.
216.	An open world trading system needs the dynamic of increased trade flows based on comparative advantage—flows which have been most noticeably stimulated in recent years by the newly industrializing countries. If the international trading system is to realize its full potential and bring benefits to the international community as a whole, we must prevent the erection of further obstacles to trade. At the same time, we must make progress in dismantling existing protectionist barriers.
217.	Australia will continue to press these items in the relevant international forums. We see these issues as essential elements in the establishment of a better and more just international economic order. For this reason Australia will be asking the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board to consider a draft resolution— similar to the one that we introduced at the fifth session of UNCTAD—on the related issues of inflation, protectionism and structural adjustment.
218.	Energy issues are now also recognized as crucial to economic growth. Significantly increased prices of certain energy resources and doubts about their supply have hindered economic development and have set back efforts for economic recovery. This is a matter of particular concern to all energy-deficient countries, particularly the non-oil-producing developing countries.
219.	Recent events have re-emphasized the urgent need to implement policies aimed both at conserving oil and at adapting economies to the necessity for using alternative energy resources. This transition is bound to be protracted and, in many countries, quite painful. But the need to embark upon it is imperative.
220.	I am convinced that we will fail in the task that confronts us if energy producers and consumers adopt confrontational attitudes. Interdependence is a basic and intractable feature of the global energy scene. Indeed, if the so-called energy crisis taught us any thing at all it is that we must establish a realistic basis upon which a consensus can be built.
221.	No country can ignore the world-wide consequences of what is happening. There is now, as ministers of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have recently warned, a real danger that, without responsible policies by oil consumers and producers alike, the energy situation will seriously damage the world economy.
222.	Australia is prepared to bring a constructive and realistic attitude to the issues involved. We see ourselves as having particular responsibilities. Australia is well placed as regards indigenous energy resources, and we are a net energy exporter. We have abundant coal and natural gas reserves, and our vast uranium deposits are now being mined. While developing these resources, we have also increased support for energy research and development and have promoted energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution. We have been active in furthering international cooperation in a variety of bilateral, regional and international arrangements.
223.	Australia has given particular attention to the needs of the developing countries of our region. We are working actively in ESCAP and in the Commonwealth Regional Consultative Group on Energy. We are also co-operating closely with other countries of the region on a bilateral basis. Emphasis has been placed on the possibility of establishing energy systems suited to the particular needs of these countries. This entails developing available conventional resources and appropriate alternative technologies.
224.	My earlier reference to uranium was in the context of its use as a valued energy resource. But Australia is deeply conscious that there are alternative and awesome uses to which it can be put. With substantial resources of uranium, Australia undoubtedly has a special responsibility to ensure that it is used for the betterment of mankind and not for its annihilation,
225.	The continuing imperatives of maintaining peace and security must remain uppermost among the challenges facing the world community in the next decade. The creation of conditions which will strengthen international security and give the world the confidence that it can live in peace is vitally important.
226.	The continuing process of strategic arms limitation between the United States and the Soviet Union is absolutely fundamental to the maintenance of the global balance and the prevention of nuclear war. The signing of the second SALT treaty was the most important step forward in arms control during the last year. We still look forward to its early ratification and implementation. We expect it to provide a basis for further quantitative and qualitative controls on the nuclear arsenals of the super-Powers in a future agreement to be reached at the third round of SALT.
227.	Australia also attaches great importance to the earliest possible conclusion of negotiations among the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on the terms of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The submission of the text of a treaty to the Committee on Disarmament before the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1980 would advance consideration of the issues and make a significant contribution to the success of that Conference, and we urge the three negotiating Powers to work towards this end.
228.	A test-ban treaty will inhibit the further development of existing nuclear arsenals. It will be an additional pillar of the international non-proliferation regime by providing a new avenue through which countries can renounce nuclear weapons. It will also give further reassurance that nuclear programmes in non-nuclear-weapon States were directed exclusively to peaceful purposes.
229.	The second Review Conference will provide a timely opportunity to lend weight to the objectives of the Treaty, to review its operation and to take account of the concerns of new parties. Australia, as a firm adherent to the principles of non-proliferation, will continue to play an active role in the preparations for the Conference.
230.	Australia is encouraged by the fact that the Treaty continues to display its relevance and its value by attracting new States parties. The accession of Indonesia and Bangladesh was a welcome development. Increasing membership contributes to the benefits which the Treaty provides for regional and international security and, of course, for stable international trade and co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
231.	The global non-proliferation scene and international nuclear co-operation could, however, be seriously damaged by the emergence of a situation in the Indian subcontinent, which shattered the fragile constraints against proliferation in that region. Australia regards this with very great concern. The risks of proliferation in southern Africa and the Middle East are also most disturbing. We hope that countries which have not acceded to the non-proliferation Treaty will reassure the international community by affirming their acceptance either of full-scope safeguards on their nuclear industries or of some other binding and verifiable commitment.
232.	Non-proliferation objectives have also been enhanced by the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, which concludes early next year. There has been significant agreement on a range of problems previously the subject of controversy. Useful ideas have emerged which could lead to important new institutional barriers to proliferation, including, for example, schemes for international plutonium storage and international spent-fuel management. We also believe that the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation study, which examined supply assurances, has put forward some useful ideas on possible common approaches to non- proliferation conditions to apply in nuclear trade.
233.	The Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, during its first year of operation, has devoted considerable effort to elaborating possible new arms control instruments. Australia, as a member of the body since the beginning of this year, has welcomed the opportunities that membership has conferred to bring new perspectives to the work of the Committee. We look forward to helping the Committee produce concrete results as it pursues its work. In particular, we hope that 1980 will see agreement obtained on measures of nuclear arms control and on radiological and chemical weapons.
234.	We further hope that, once work has been completed in the Committee on a comprehensive test-ban treaty, the nuclear-weapon Powers will give serious consideration to proposals for a cut-off in the production of fissionable materials for nuclear weapons. This would be a major step to ending the nuclear-arms race and reinforcing non-proliferation, and would represent further real progress in the search for conditions in which mankind can be freed from the threat of devastation and destruction.
235.	In considering the conditions for maintaining international peace and security, we must pay particular attention to the areas of conflict and tension. Through its peace-keeping machinery the United Nations has played an important role in containing otherwise dangerously volatile situations. Peace-keeping machinery not only protects future generations from the horrors of war, it protects people now from the threat of conflict caused by rivalries and fears from the past.
236.	Australia has maintained a firm tradition of sup-port for the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. We see our contributions to peace-keeping, in Cyprus, the Middle East and Kashmir, as direct contributions to the cause of peace. Our offer to contribute to the proposed United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia has been made with quite the same conviction. But peace-keeping forces do not of themselves generate lasting peace. Parties to conflicts must be persuaded to negotiate, as they are now doing in London in relation to Zimbabwe, as certain of them are doing in the Middle East, and as they must continue to do in Cyprus.
237.	I now want to consider some of these issues in more detail. We are all familiar with the long history of the Middle East conflict and with the disappointments which have characterized it. Australia has supported the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.  We see it as a first step towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. We understand the fears and concerns of others and appreciate that a solution of that region's problems depends on factors not yet settled or dealt with in the current negotiations. In this context, Australia regrets the current policies of the Israeli Government in relation to the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories.
238.	It is essential to devise a peace which satisfies all interested parties—and which puts an end to terrorism. We therefore base our policies on the need for negotiations starting from the principles of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must be accepted. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to a homeland alongside Israel, and their corresponding responsibility to live peacefully with all their neighbours also must be recognized.
239.	In this spirit the Australian Government continues to offer its support to any efforts to reach a settlement acceptable to all parties concerned. We hope that all will turn away from statements, actions and policies which are prejudicial to the search for a comprehensive peace.
240.	In thinking about the Middle East we should not ignore the sufferings of the people in the ravaged and divided land of Lebanon. The Australian community has been enriched by the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and refugees from Lebanon and other parts of the region and we share their heartfelt concern that no effort should be spared to bring peace to the region.
241.	The plight of the people of Cyprus is also a matter of the greatest concern to the Australian community. We whole-heartedly support the continuing role of the United Nations and of the Secretary-General in particular in efforts to bring peace to all the people of Cyprus. Australia welcomed the resumption of intercommunal talks in June 1979, following the agreement between President Kyprianou and Mr. Denktag, itself based on the Makarios-Denktas guidelines,16 but we greatly regret that those talks have not progressed. We hope that debate on the Cyprus issue at this General Assembly will provide the impetus for further progress.
242.	Australia is deeply concerned at the continuing tragic loss of life as a result of the conflict in Zimbabwe. There have been too many wasted years and wasted opportunities. The agreement reached at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka in August provides a new opportunity which must not be lost. Australia fully supports that agreement which we hope will carry the parties to settlement.
243.	The presence of the principal parties to the dispute at the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference recently convened by the United Kingdom Government is encouraging. We urge the parties to carry their negotiations to fulfilment and to bring an end to the present tragic situation which has brought the whole of southern Africa to the brink of ruin and war.
244.	As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, Australia has actively sought a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Namibia. The Australian Government gives its full support to the consultations being carried on between the representatives of the five Western countries and the South African Government and strongly hopes that those consultations will resolve the current impasse. It is crucial for stability in southern Africa that agreement be reached on the Secretary-General's proposals. 
245.	There remains, of course, the problem of the policies of the South African Government. Australia will continue to work for the end of the deplorable policy of apartheid. The point is approaching when patience will run out within South Africa itself and when increasing resort to violence will be seen by many as their only option. Let us hope that that point will not be reached. Let us hope that reason and responsibility will prevail.
246.	Australia is deeply concerned by the problem of refugees throughout the world—in Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia. We give full support to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in his efforts to alleviate the distress and to promote the resettlement of the dispossessed peoples. My own country has a proud and continuing tradition in settling refugees from many continents and countries.
247.	In South-East Asia, the plight of the 'boat people' from Viet Nam and the land refugees from Kampuchea has assumed tragic proportions. Innocent men, women and children have been displaced and rendered homeless on a massive scale. They have been forced to flee from war, famine, disease and the abhorrent pressure of political coercion. A major humanitarian crisis exists. This has precipitated serious political and economic problems and tensions in the region. The exodus has been of such proportions as to jeopardize regional stability.
248.	The financial, political and social burdens involved have fallen particularly heavily on the countries of first asylum that is the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The international community must recognize the very real limits on the ability of those countries to cope with a crisis of such massive proportions. Important new steps towards meeting that crisis were taken at the meeting convened by the Secretary-General in Geneva in July.  We in Australia have from the beginning taken in a substantial number of refugees and we are also providing substantial financial assistance.
249.	At the same time, Australia believes it is vitally important to recognize that the underlying causes of the refugee exodus have yet to be tackled. We have noted that since the Geneva meeting there has been a diminution in the numbers of those leaving Viet Nam. We look to the Government of Viet Nam to abide by the undertakings it gave at Geneva and to make sustained and serious efforts to resolve this problem in all its aspects.
250.	The tragedy of widespread starvation and disease in war-ravaged Kampuchea also demands our immediate attention. Whatever one's political persuasion, whatever one's views on the causes of the present havoc in Kampuchea, one cannot ignore the desperate plight of several million of the Kampuchean people. It is vital that massive international relief should reach the Khmer people immediately. They must be saved. It is essential that the practical problems of organizing necessary relief measures be overcome quickly. In the name of humanity, it is imperative that all parties fully co-operate in this emergency. The international relief agencies and voluntary organizations must be allowed to carry forward this task as a matter of the utmost urgency.
251.	Australia for its part is prepared to do all within its power to assist in international relief efforts. We have already agreed to provide, through the World Food Programme, 3,500 metric tons of rice for humanitarian relief in Kampuchea. We are also completing arrangements for a special charter flight to carry emergency food and medical supplies to the people of Kampuchea. Australia fully supports the appeal to the international community made by the Secretary- General on 27 September for funds and supplies for Kampuchea.
252.	Against this background, my Government is also deeply concerned by the intensified hostilities in Kampuchea. An increase in the scale of the fighting can only add to the already intolerable suffering of the people of Kampuchea, swell the flow of refugees and complicate still farther the difficulties of organizing relief operations. Wider conflict within Kampuchea also carries risks of escalation and so endangers the security of the South-East Asian region as a whole. We must do immediately whatever we can to alleviate the misery and want of millions of human beings. But we must also recognize that there can be no lasting solution to the problems of Kampuchea until peace is restored, all external forces withdrawn and conditions created in which the Kampuchean people can decide their own future for themselves, free from outside interference of any kind.
253.	A recurring theme of many of the conflicts to which I have referred is the disregard for basic human values and rights. It is therefore particularly appropriate that at this time His Holiness Pope John Paul II—a great humanitarian, a great defender of freedom, of faith and of the human spirit—should be attending this session of the General Assembly. His presence tomorrow will remind us all of the commitments we have all made in supporting the Charter of the United Nations—commitments to the achievement of real improvements in the condition of individual men, women and children.
254.	The United Nations has embarked upon a number of action-oriented programmes. The International Year of the Child, the United Nations Decade for Women, the two United Nations Development Decades, the Disarmament Decade and the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, have all aimed to improve the lot of individual men and women.
255.	Much has been done to bring comfort and hope to the dispossessed and the deprived peoples of the world. Major instruments in the field of human rights have entered into force and new instruments are now being framed. The validity of the claims of the nations and people suffering economic and social hardship have been increasingly recognized. Energetic attempts have also been made to confront the problems of terrorism and refugees. But, having said that, I recognize that major problems of human rights and social needs remain.
256.	Nothing is more pernicious in this regard than racism and racial prejudice. At the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka, Australia joined with every other Commonwealth country in issuing the Lusaka Declaration of the Commonwealth on Racism and Racial Prejudice—a document which addressed itself to the problem of racism in all its forms, in every country. Racism is one among the many human problems that must be tackled in the 1980s. People will not accept nor should they be expected to accept fear, want and the systematic violation of their rights. The United Nations must organize itself to deal effectively with the pressing problems confronting so many in everyday life.
257.	We agree with the Secretary-General on the need to generate renewed public support in all countries for the United Nations and its work to fulfil its objectives on behalf of all mankind.
258.	Australia is moving into the 1980s with a strong desire to promote solutions to the many challenges which we face. We do so on the basis of a considered assessment of Australia's place in the new circumstances of today. I have, as recently as 18 September, submitted in the Australian Parliament a report on Australia's relations with the third world. So far as I know, no other developed country has undertaken so detailed an analysis of the question of its relations with the third world, yet it is a question which affects the prospects of peace, prosperity and progress for all mankind.
259.	Australia accepts the fact that it has serious responsibilities. We are not prepared to stand idly by at a time when drift and even stalemate hamper progress in key areas of international relations. This drift must be arrested and the stalemate, broken.
260.	We have no illusions that the next decade will be any easier than the last. The international community must approach the 1980s with renewed vigour and with a determination to develop practical and realistic solutions to the issues which we face. Above all we should avoid situations in which preconceived or outdated attitudes and ideological rigidities preclude progress. With goodwill, no problem is intractable."
3360,34,1979,PNG,"﻿I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating the President, on his unanimous election to the high office he now occupies. The accomplishments of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples under his chairmanship to date, as well as his wide-ranging experience in the activities of this body, confirm without any doubt my delegation's confidence that under his leadership, guidance and direction, this thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly will be a success.
348.	I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Salim's predecessor, Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia, for the most efficient manner in which he presided over our proceedings during the last session. My delegation extend its compliments on a duty well performed.
349.	My delegation wishes to convey my country's condolences to the people of Angola on the untimely death of their leader, the late Agostinho Neto.
350.	My delegation is particularly pleased to welcome Saint Lucia to membership in this world body of nations, and we look forward to developing a close and co-operative relationship with it. Papua New Guinea and Saint Lucia are both members of the common-wealth of nations, as well as being developing island States. My country shares with Saint Lucia the feelings of being free from colonial domination, and we take this opportunity to wish it a prosperous future.
351.	As on previous occasions, the delegation of Papua New Guinea will participate with interest and hope in the deliberations of the General Assembly on major international issues. We shall attempt to do what we can within our capacities to work towards constructive solutions to these issues. For the first time, we plan to bring to the attention of the assembled delegations the issue of decolonization, which is of particular concern to the people in our region, the South Pacific.
352.	As is customary in the general debate, my Government would like to take this opportunity to draw the Assembly's attention to a number of issues concerning Papua New Guinea as a member of the international community. Some of these issues directly affect countries a long way from my own, while others affect countries closer at hand. But those to which I shall refer all have such a bearing on the prospects for peace, stability and development in the world that they cannot be ignored.
353.	My Government is concerned about the Middle East situation. While we are heartened by signs of progress towards peace, we are also perturbed by the possibility that the momentum might be lost, at enormous cost not only to the people of the immediate region, but, ultimately, to us all.
354.	My Government welcomed the initiatives taken by the Egyptian and Israeli leaders, and it commends the role played by the President of the United States in trying to promote an atmosphere conducive to negotiations leading to the signing of a Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt. But my Government also remains troubled by the continuing failure to find a solution to the Palestinian problem.
355.	My Government recognizes that Papua New Guinea cannot hope to exert much influence on the situation in the Middle East. But we would be derelict in our duty if we did not add our voice to those that are calling for greater efforts to be made in order to achieve lasting peace. Middle Eastern and other world leaders have perhaps the greatest opportunity in a generation to lay the groundwork for lasting peace. My Government urges them, in the interest of us all, to make full use of that opportunity.
356.	My delegation is encouraged to note that the prospects for a negotiated settlement in Namibia have become more promising. However, we still wish to emphasize our firm belief that a successful outcome will depend on the holding of elections under United Nations supervision.
357.	Papua New Guinea takes particular pleasure in complimenting the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and the United Nations Council for Namibia on the role they have played in seeking a solution to the Namibian problem. Pleased as we are with the progress made, however, we cannot be content until we see the emergence of an independent Namibia. We hope that independence will soon be achieved through the democratic process of free elections. We also hope that such a process will guarantee citizens' rights of freedom and equality in the new nation.
358.	My Government remains concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe. We believe that the present constitutional arrangements hold out little prospect for a lasting solution. My Government believes that they must be changed. We think it deplorable that the long- awaited constitution based on 'majority rule' turned out, when published, to be but a further device designed to entrench the white minority's interest.
359.	My Government notes with appreciation that all parties are involved in renewed negotiations for a durable internal settlement guaranteeing genuine majority rule in Zimbabwe through a free democratic electoral process. Papua New Guinea welcomes the initiatives arising out of the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries and the considerable advance which is being made in the current constitutional talks in London which, we hope, will lead to genuine majority rule in Zimbabwe.
360.	With regard to southern Africa, my Government wishes to express its concern and abhorrence at institutionalized racial discrimination and segregation for the purposes of the suppression and exploitation of the black people in southern Africa. It is a subject on which the people of my country have very strong feelings.
361.	My Government has, in previous sessions, stated in the strongest terms, that apartheid is a disgusting, degrading and inhuman practice. We regret to note that, despite many calls, the racist regime in southern Africa remains reluctant to abolish its apartheid policies. I should like to reiterate the fears my delegation expressed last year on the question of apartheid. Persistent failure to deal effectively with such a continuing offence to mankind is likely to have a most terrible outcome for both the white and black populations of South Africa.
362.	I turn now to events in Indo-China and the question of the Indo-Chinese refugees. As a country which lies at the cross-roads between South-East Asia and the South Pacific, we are concerned about the security implications that have arisen as a result of the overthrow of the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea and the confrontation between Viet Nam and Kampuchea. We would like to see peace and stability prevail in the region, and urge those who, in one way or another, are involved in the confrontation to settle their differences by discussion in conference rooms and not by using guns on battlefields.
363.	My Government believes that the mass exodus of refugees could be arrested if the Governments concerned would stop deliberately creating unfavourable circumstances that compel citizens to leave their homelands and seek refuge elsewhere. Viet Nam and Kampuchea should co-operate closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that those who leave their countries are not inflicted upon their neighbours. These neighbours have so far been compassionate, but they are becoming increasingly disturbed at the burdens thrust upon them.
364.	My country had the honour to be invited by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to a Meeting in Geneva in July this year which attempted to alleviate the crisis caused by Indo-Chinese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries in South East Asia and to Australia. We were represented at the meeting by a cabinet minister.
365.	My Government fully recognizes the humanitarian nature of the refugee problem, which has become a common concern of the entire world community. The Papua New Guinea Government appreciates the role played by the ASEAN countries in meeting the problem. The establishment of refugee processing centres in the ASEAN region is a positive move to alleviate the burdens that have been inflicted upon the countries in the region. May I stress, however, that the success of these centres will depend on a wider response to the need for developed nations to accept more refugees.
366.	I should like to inform this gathering that my Government shares the views of those countries which called upon aid donors to Viet Nam to consider diverting their assistance to resettlement and rehabilitation programmes for Indo-Chinese refugees. In addition, Papua New Guinea would like to renew the call for a withdrawal of those external pressures which have in-creased regional tensions and aggravated the refugee problem. My Government also endorses the call for an end to the flow of Indo-Chinese refugees made at the Tokyo Economic Summit by the developed nations, by the twelfth meeting of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers at Bali in June, and by the Meeting on Refugees and Dis-placed Persons in South-East Asia in Geneva in July.
367.	In addition to the regional problems to which 1 have referred, there are some more general subjects of world-wide significance on which I should like to say something. They include the subject of human rights, which Papua New Guinea considers most important.
368.	My Government takes pleasure in noting the measures taken by countries Members of this body to safeguard human rights. But there are still too many instances of governments which continue to deny the basic rights of their citizens. The denial of basic human rights on any grounds—racial, political, economic or any other arbitrary grounds—gives rise to injustices which my Government finds intolerable.
369.	We cannot understand how conscientious human beings can continue to suppress the basic rights of their fellow-citizens. The suppression of basic human rights in such circumstances cannot be accidental. My Government appeals to the international community to condemn those Governments which persist in violating basic human rights. We urge Governments which violate such rights to take prompt and effective action to respect the dignity of their citizens.
370.	My Government views the question of disarmament as a matter of utmost importance to international peace and security. It is our strong belief that lasting international peace and security cannot be built on the accumulation of weapons. I believe genuine and lasting peace can be created only through the effective implementation of the security system as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations. General and complete disarmament under effective international control must be the principal objective of ensuring the survival of mankind and eliminating the danger of war, particularly nuclear war, as well as ensuring that war is no longer an instrument for settling international disputes.
371.	It is the desire and wish of small nations, such as mine, for the peoples of this world to have peace and security. The fulfilment of this desire will then enable us to concentrate on our efforts to develop and improve the lives of our people in the social and economic sectors of our over-all development objectives.
372.	My delegation is opposed to all forms of nuclear testing—atmospheric or otherwise—because we firmly believe that the cessation of nuclear testing is a step towards disarmament and the prevention of nuclear pollution of the environment. We equally oppose the dumping of nuclear wastes for the same reasons. I refer in particular to the South Pacific region, where nuclear testing takes place every year. I wish to state once again that my Government strongly opposes nuclear testing in the region. We therefore call on those who are responsible to cease all forms of nuclear testing in the Pacific because they are endangering the lives of the inhabitants of the region.
373.	As the Disarmament Decade introduced by the General Assembly draws to a conclusion, my Government is disappointed to note that there has not been any real progress towards the reduction of arms nor have there been any negotiations leading to a treaty on general and complete disarmament. We note with some satisfaction the signing of the second SALT Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, we are still hopeful that some international agreement or arrangements, such as the comprehensive test-ban Treaty, will be negotiated and agreed to as soon as practicable.
374.	The international community today recognizes the need to move quickly towards a New International Economic Order, even though there exist differing views on major proposals that have been put forward. The Government of Papua New Guinea is deeply concerned at the slow progress being made.
375.	The attempts to regulate world trade in primary commodities, the reform of the external framework for the industrialization of developing countries, the reform of the international monetary system, the strengthening of economic co-operation among developing countries are all still outstanding issues. There are many reasons why they have not been resolved and I do not propose to go into them. But I should like to say that one of the main reasons has been opposition from developed countries, with the result that conferences similar to the fifth session of UNCTAD have repeatedly failed to achieve agreement on any one of the issues that I have mentioned.
376.	If the international community has learned anything in recent years, it has surely been that the economic welfare of each sovereign nation depends on a network of interdependence. My Government is deeply concerned at the failure of the long-awaited world recovery to come about. We believe that current economic problems cannot be blamed on the management of individual national economies. The management of each economy is becoming dependent on the external environment. Recovery and development require an enlightened attitude of mutual appreciation of each other's needs, interests and problems on the part of all countries. Without such an appreciation, the prospect that any dialogue between developed and developing countries will lead to constructive changes in the international economic order must be regarded as gloomy indeed.
377.	A concrete example of international cooperation for development is the Lome Convention on trade and aid between the European Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Lome Convention expires in a few months and the long negotiations on a successor agreement have been finalized. It appears that the successor agreement will, in general, be similar to the current one. However, the second Lome' agreement will contain a new mechanism which purports to assist mineral exporting countries. The Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the conclusion of the Lome negotiations. But we have reservations about the new mechanism in that it offers assistance only to countries which have suffered reductions in their capacity to produce certain minerals and export them to the European market. The assistance itself is restricted to project or programme aid confined to the mineral sector and designed to restore production or export capacity. There is no help for those countries, including my own, which have suffered severe economic damage through low prices for our vital mineral exports.
378.	It is our strong conviction that a mineral assistance scheme, if it is to be of real value, must include the provision of concessional finance for countries that have suffered a loss of export earnings or, alternatively, a loss of Government revenue as a result of low export prices.
379.	All developing countries are concerned that in a harsh world the poor countries are supposed to be grateful for what they are offered and should not expect to have a say in what the offer contains. Such a situation gives rise to extreme difficulties in the formulation of plans for development. As long as developing countries, to which category my country clearly belongs, are not given a greater say in deciding how they are helped, we shall continue to face great difficulties in providing the basic needs of our people.
380.	Finally, the 1970s in the South Pacific will be remembered as the decade in which many of the island Territories gained self-determination and independence. It is in this decade that the following South Pacific Territories have gained their self-determination and independence: Fiji, the Republic of Nauru, Niue, the Cook Islands, Tuvalu, the Republic of Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.
381.	I should like to bring to the General Assembly's attention a question of particular concern to the people of the South Pacific. I refer here to the continued French presence in the region.
382.	The right of self-determination and independence is inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations. It was reaffirmed in resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. It is a right to which newly independent countries such as my own feel a strong commitment. We feel that we have a duty to our Pacific neighbours to raise the question here and pursue it elsewhere. In fact, we have already done so in the Special Committee on decolonization.
383.	Four years ago, Papua New Guinea became in-dependent. Since then, the number of independent Pacific island nations has grown to eight, four of which are Members of the United Nations. The end of the colonial era in the Pacific islands is, we hope, in sight.
384.	The people of the Pacific islands have been fortunate in that the decolonization of the region has generally been brought about as peacefully as its name suggests. We have appreciated the interest taken in the process by Members of the United Nations. We have been fortunate that the Australian, United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments recognized our rights to self-determination and continue to play a constructive and helpful part in our development. But we would be wise to remember that, even in the Pacific islands, the process of decolonization was not as smooth, nor the outcome as certain, as may sometimes appear when we look back.
385.	Mr. President, you, yourself as well as many of the representatives in the General Assembly will recall the difficulties and doubts you and your fellow countrymen faced before your countries became independent. You will recall, too, the encouragement and support you received from leaders of countries which had previously become independent. You know that, at independence, new relationships become possible with former rulers.
386.	My Government feels that it has a duty to see that other Pacific island peoples are offered the encouragement and support once offered to us. In the case of the New Hebrides, that duty is not hard to perform. The United Kingdom and French Governments have recognized the right to self-determination of the people of the New Hebrides. We applaud this attitude and look forward hopefully to its independence in 1980. In other parts of the Pacific, however, we feel compelled to respond to calls for assistance from leaders of people whose rights to self-determination have not been secured. I refer here specifically to the people of other French dependencies—New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna Islands.
387.	Elsewhere in the Pacific islands, the former colonial Powers have generally recognized the islands peoples' rights to self-determination without much outside prompting. The French Government has seen elsewhere how the denial of such rights cannot be sustained. My Government appeals to France to recognize the rights of the indigenous inhabitants. We urge other Members of the United Nations to support our appeal.
388.	My Government would like to pay a sincere tribute to France for the constructive role it has played in the creation of important new trade and aid relationships between the independent Pacific island nations and Western Europe. We look forward to the day when France's relationships with its remaining Pacific island dependencies have been transformed and it can play an equally constructive role in their development; but I must emphasize my Government's conviction that the commitment to peace, human rights and development of which I spoke earlier requires us to speak out on our neighbours' behalf.
"
3379,34,1979,NZL,"﻿As a member of the Commonwealth, New Zealand is pleased to welcome Saint Lucia to the United Nations and to offer its warmest congratulations to the representatives of Saint Lucia at this session of the General Assembly. We look forward to working with the delegation of Saint Lucia in furthering the purposes of this Organization.
248.	It is a pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, and other officers of the Assembly on your election. I should be grateful if you would convey my special greetings to Ambassador Salim, the President of this session. New Zealand values its special link with the United Republic of Tanzania. We work together in partnership, within the Commonwealth. We admire Tanzania's example of self-reliance in the struggle for social and economic progress. We admire the leadership Tanzania has given to the movement for self-determination not only in Africa but for all people. We New Zealanders value, in particular, the help Ambassador Salim, as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, has given us as we have worked, loyally and consistently, to promote the principle of self-determination in the small island Territories of the South Pacific which have been associated with us.
249.	Ambassador Salim has had the opportunity of seeing how remote and isolated are the islands of the Pacific. New Zealand, too, is remote from the trouble- centres of the world. This geographical isolation, how-ever, has never cut us off from the impact of world events. This year we have followed with attention, and with concern, events in three areas of instability: the Middle East, southern Africa and South-East Asia. We have welcomed the political progress made in the Middle East, limited though that may have been. On the other hand, we have deplored the continued escalation of oil prices, for this has jeopardized efforts to establish a stable world economic order and damaged the economies of many countries. We have taken part, through the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka, in the efforts of the Commonwealth to break the impasse on Rhodesia. But our most direct concern, naturally enough, has been with the conflict that has taken place nearest to us. The calamitous events in Indo-China have caused us the gravest concern. There we have seen continued armed conflict. Vast numbers of people have been forced to move. Starvation and suffering are daily facts of life. Fighting goes on and may well spread. The already desperate food shortage threatens to get worse. The situation is little short of disastrous.
250.	My Government is deeply concerned by these developments. The conflict in Indo-China has polarized South-East Asia: a gulf of mistrust now divides the States of Indo-China and the members of ASEAN.
251.	New Zealand has close and friendly ties with the five countries that belong to ASEAN. We have welcomed the rapid progress they have made in developing their economies and improving the living standards of their peoples. It has been a remarkable achievement. ASEAN has emerged as a significant force in international affairs. It has been able to make a major contribution towards the stability of the But the longer the conflict continues, the greater the danger that the great Powers will once more involved and establish themselves in the area, the longer the fighting goes on in Kampuchea the more risk there is that it will spill over into Thailand. The conflict in Indo-China threatens to jeopardize not only the prosperity of the ASEAN countries but also their effectiveness as an influence for peace and stability in Southeast Asia.
252.	Two attempts have been made this year to resolve the conflict by force. Neither has succeeded, the conflict arises from deep-seated issues—ancient animosities, revived and stimulated by recent actions that have been aided and inflamed from outside IndoChina. Nationalism runs too high for any one party to impose its will on another by force. Peace will be restored only when the countries of the area—those in Indo-China and their neighbours, too—learn to respect one another's independence and territorial integrity, as they pledged to do when they joined the United Nations.
253.	There can be no justification for any government to send armed forces into another country against the will of its people. There is no justification for a government to drive out vast numbers of its own people to hazard their lives on the high seas. It has been abundantly demonstrated that government policies can stimulate, and can retard, the flow of refugees. If that desperate flow of people begins again, the world will know where the responsibility lies. If, however, it ends once and for all, the process of political negotiation can begin. If the withdrawal of forces can be brought about, the normalization of relations can be contemplated. The massive task of relief and rehabilitation for the suffering people of Indo-China can proceed without hindrance.
254.	New Zealand has always said that the most pressing need was to begin working towards a political settlement. That need is even more urgent today. Any settlement must be based on the fact that there are three separate countries in Indo-China, each with its own national tradition. These three countries must live closely together. In practice this means that there can be no peace until the independence of Kampuchea is assured and Kampuchea is prepared to co-operate with its neighbours.
255.	My Government accepts as logical the decision taken by the General Assembly on the question of Kampuchean credentials. That does not mean that we condone in any way the policies of the Pol Pot Government. That regime was tyrannical in the extreme. It was notorious for its cruelty and its utter disregard for the most basic human rights of its people. Nevertheless, it was the established Government of Kampuchea, and it was recognized by the international community. The same cannot be said of the regime headed by Heng Samrin. That regime was installed by foreign forces. It has failed to demonstrate its independence. The main aim of any political settlement must be to let the people of Kampuchea express themselves freely without the dominating presence of foreign troops. They must be able to decide their own future until those conditions exist my Government sees no justification for expelling the present representatives of Kampuchea or for accepting another delegation 
256.	Meanwhile, we face the practical problem of dealing with the human consequences of the continuing conflict. On one aspect of it the United Nations has already taken some effective action. The Meeting convened by the Secretary-General in Geneva in July succeeded in mobilizing greatly increased resources for the relief of refugees from Indo-China. My Government welcomed the Secretary-General's initiative. We are playing our part in the programme he has launched. We have also noted with satisfaction the decline in the flow of refugees since the Meeting. That showed that the Government of Viet Nam was accepting its responsibilities. We can hope, therefore, that there will be no resurgence of the tragedies we saw earlier this year.
257.	The most desperate human problem at this moment is in Kampuchea. Continual fighting, following the internal troubles of recent years, has uprooted a large part of the population. Food supplies have been severely disrupted. Before long, 10 per cent of the country's population may be starving. Famine would bring a new wave of desperate refugees who would flee to Thailand. The world must stop this disaster happening. Another great effort by the international community is essential. Food and medical supplies must be provided—and right away. New Zealand is ready to join in this new effort.
258.	We do not forget that in other regions there are also massive displacements of people. Some of these situations are of tragically long standing. Here, too, the search for negotiated solutions to the conflicts that have caused this human suffering must be a prime concern of this Assembly.
259.	In southern Africa there have been some promising developments. The most significant was the agreement reached by the Commonwealth Heads of Government at Lusaka last month. From this came the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference on Zimbabwe Rhodesia. My Prime Minister, to underline his support for the agreement reached at Lusaka, sent a message to all 24 delegates assembled in London for the conference. He said:
'The road to a peaceful settlement is now open to you. It is for you—each and all—to make your contribution to the final stage and to lead your country into independence, peace and stability. I do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead of you. But I hope that you will keep in mind at all times that the fate of millions of your men, women and children, now and in the future, lies in your hands—and in your hands alone.'
260.	New Zealand hopes that, through this Lusaka initiative, which underlines once more the value of the Commonwealth association, one area of southern Africa will at last reach peaceful and legal independence.
261.	My Government is also encouraged that the consultations which five Western Powers initiated, over two years ago, on Namibia have been resumed. A possibility now exists for the final, legal independence of the Namibian people.
262.	But if there are prospects for a peaceful solution to two of the problems of southern Africa, the third the intolerable system of apartheid, still exists unchecked in the Republic of South Africa. New Zealand joins with the rest of mankind in urging the Government of that unhappy country to move now to break down the barriers of apartheid— those barricades that deny the very essence of human rights and human dignity to the vast majority of its people. Apartheid nurtures the seeds of bitter and vicious conflict. If only for that reason— though it is only one of many—the Members of the United Nations cannot rest until the risk of this conflict has been eliminated.
263.	In his inaugural remarks the President called on this Assembly to pursue practical means, rather than to promote ever-increasing resolutions, in the search for solutions to the many problems which afflict the world today. Nowhere could his advice be better heeded than with respect to the situation in the Middle East. My Government sees as a significant advance the dramatic events of the past two years, which culminated in the Camp David agreements and the subsequent negotiations between Egypt and Israel. The current efforts of the leaders of these States must be given a chance to succeed. A critical dialogue has begun. The objective of the world community now should be to broaden that dialogue.
264.	My Government continues to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the essential element for a negotiated settlement. That resolution remains a central foundation, and it can be built on. It is now widely recognized that the search for a political solution in the Middle East must involve the participation of the Palestinian people. The rights of the Palestinians, including their right to self-determination and to establish an independent Palestinian State if they so desire, can no longer be ignored.
265.	The road to a negotiated, just and lasting solution in the Middle East will not be easy. It is critical therefore, that everyone concerned should eschew insensitive or provocative acts. We believe that the continued establishment of Israeli settlements in land occupied during the 1967 war is one such act. The recent outbreak of hostilities in southern Lebanon is another. My Government rejects the policy of pre-emptive strikes by Israel as strongly as it rejects any act which violates the territorial integrity of Israel. The road to peace is fragile. It should not be put at risk.
266.	The year 1979 could have been a watershed year for the international community in its continuing debate on global economic reform. The fifth session of UNC- TAD and the Tokyo round of the multilateral trade negotiations were major events which held great promise for a new break-through in North-South relations, but then ended inconclusively. The urgent task of this session of the Assembly will be to find a way of restoring momentum to the debate on the establishment of a New International Economic Order, for the international community faces pressing and dangerous economic problems. The economic 'ripple-effects' of this year's sharp price rises in oil have become painfully obvious—to developed and developing countries alike. The outlook is for severe disruption to the process of global economic growth. Sluggish rates of economic growth will inhibit the continued development of enlarged 'northern' markets for 'southern' goods—and vice versa. Heavier foreign debt burdens for many countries seem inevitable. Inflation, unemployment, balance of payments disequilibrium and protectionism will feed upon global economic uncertainty. The pressing need to develop new energy sources will be set back financially—and therefore technically.
267.	No Government need imagine that it will be able to insulate its economy entirely from the effects of a spreading economic malaise. Developing countries— and all small economies, that rely on trade, including my own—will be especially vulnerable.
268.	In the face of these probabilities we can no longer afford the luxury of debating the possibility of new forms of global economic co-operation, structural adjustment and institutional reform. The time has come to put an end to the polemics and arid definitional disputes which have so far characterized the dialogue between North and South. Let us do so in the sure knowledge that if we do not master the forces of economic and social change, they will surely master us.
269.	New Zealand looks to this session of the General Assembly, and to the special session to be held in 1980, to bring a new sense of purpose to the unfinished task of formulating strategies for global economic management. We believe that the effectiveness of these strategies and the future well-being of the interdependent global economy will rest, to a very considerable degree, on the success of renewed efforts to find constructive solutions in two critical sectors—trade and energy.
270.	The explosion in world trade in the last quarter of a century has brought greater prosperity to many countries. We must ensure that this growth is maintained, based upon acknowledgement of the doctrine of comparative efficiency and a positive assault on the forces of protectionism. New Zealand cannot accept that there should be two sets of rules, one for the old industrial producers and another for the rest, that is, for the new industrial producers and for the agricultural producers. Agricultural protectionism is practised by almost all industrialized countries—to the disadvantage of their consumers and to the frustration of internationally efficient producers, such as New Zealand. That, we believe, is a denial of the responsibility of this generation to establish an efficient production base for feeding the next. This responsibility demands new approaches and positive adjustment policies based on the principles of free multilateral trade.
271.	We also have to learn to see energy issues in a new perspective. Experts predict that within the next 10 years the production capacity for our present oil- based energy system will have reached a ceiling. There will be further rises in the real price of oil and an absolute and increasing shortage in relation to total global import requirements. Therefore, there can be no argument: we must move to new energy systems. The challenge lies in how we manage the transitional period. The General Assembly has already risen to this challenge by deciding to convene in 1981 a United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. New Zealand attaches the highest importance to this Conference. It intends to play its full part to ensure its success. While many important energy questions lie outside its purview, the Conference has the potential to make a significant contribution to identifying new energy systems that will benefit us all.
272.	In its short history this Organization has often taken the lead in promoting new goals for social justice, international peace and racial equality. Now it must define new standards for global economic co-operation. New Zealand sees this as an evolutionary process. Not all countries share this view. Yet, regardless of our individual prescriptions for the world's economic ills, I am sure we can all agree that this is the place, and now is the time, to give force to the concept of global economic interdependence which we have talked about for so long. What is needed now in the North-South dialogue is not resolutions, but resolution.
273.	We in New Zealand are conscious of the sense of disenchantment in the United Nations and in other international economic bodies with the use to which these existing mechanisms are put. We are ready to look with an open mind at proposals that may come forward for new mechanisms, or new methods of working, to help us find a way around the obstacles which at present inhibit our efforts to achieve a new order in international co-operation. The recent meeting of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 took an important initiative to this end. Such a proposal is an expression of faith in our collective capacity to control our economic destiny. We may from time to time lose faith in the machinery. We cannot afford to lose faith in the goals.
274.	Another major topic on the agenda of this Assembly is the problem of disarmament. There are some areas in the vast network of negotiations currently in progress where there is a clear and urgent need to bring the negotiations to a head and to reach new agreement.
275.	Foremost among these is the need to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The Pacific was for many years an arena for the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Underground tests are still being conducted in the South Pacific, and elsewhere, despite repeated calls for a halt by the overwhelming majority or the United Nations membership. Last year the General Assembly set a time-table for the conclusion of a treaty. To the regret of us all, that time-table has not been met. It was a reasonable time-table, given the very substantial agreement already apparent on the main provisions of such a treaty. The problems that still stand in the way of a treaty are described as technical. But as a contributor to the work of the ad hoc seismic group, formed to study some of the requirements of a system to monitor compliance with the treaty, we must frankly say that the problems in this area do not seem to us to justify further delay. The conclusion of a treaty is widely recognized as a key to preventing horizontal as well as vertical proliferation.
276.	We shall also support endeavours to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. We continue to attach primacy to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to universal adherence to it. Some States continue to stand aside. The balance of advantage under the Treaty appears to them to favour the nuclear-weapons States. They believe also that the nuclear-weapons States have not honoured the obligation they incurred under the Treaty to advance the control and limitation of their nuclear arsenals, and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Be that as it may, the pursuit of a nuclear option by any State not currently possessed of nuclear weapons must inevitably have the gravest implications for regional stability and global security. No nation will enhance its security by these means.
277.	How can the international community allay the fears that may lead a country to keep this nuclear option open? It can encourage and support efforts to accommodate differences within regions. At the global level more can be done. The nuclear-weapons States have been prepared to make unilateral declarations undertaking not to use or to threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapons States. Each has, however, qualified the statement in a different way. Without minimizing the difficulties in the way of reconciling these statements, New Zealand would support further exploration of the ground for bringing these assurances together so as to give them a collective and ultimately binding force.
278.	New Zealand has welcomed, as a major step in the limitation of nuclear arsenals, the signature of the second SALT Treaty by the United States and the USSR. Like others, we hope it will soon be ratified. We look forward, also, to further rounds of negotiations that will lead not only to reductions in nuclear armament but to corresponding limitations in the conventional field. It is on the success of these efforts, and on the growing confidence that should come from such successes, that progress in other areas will rest. It would be a tragic irony if the acceptance of restrictions in one area led to pressures for enhanced capacity in others. Peoples everywhere legitimately expect that the process of reducing armaments will be made irreversible and that resources currently spent on defence will be redirected to reduce suffering and to advance human welfare.
279.	Finally, my Government wishes to pay a tribute to this Organization for its leadership in the field of human rights. In the International Covenants we have a mechanism for the genuine advancement of human rights. Last year in the general debate the Prime Minister of New Zealand expressed our intention to ratify both Covenants. We have done this, and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission has among its tasks that of overseeing their implementation. As a consequence, there have been distinct advances in positive action programmes to enhance the position of minorities, where this is necessary and to introduce new procedures and practices that will help women take their place in the full range of national life. The International Year of the Child has been the occasion of spontaneous action throughout the community to take heed of the needs of children.
280.	We have taken pride in our domestic record in the field of human rights, but we are not complacent. As our multiracial society develops, new perceptions gleaned in part from the international oversight which we have accepted as a party to the Covenants, impel us to further efforts to improve our performance.
281.	New Zealand wishes this Assembly well in its indispensable endeavours."
3487,54,1999,MHL,"﻿Mr. President, on
behalf of my delegation, I congratulate you on your election
to preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth
session. I bring you warm greetings from His Excellency
President Imata Kabua of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands. He asks that I bring to the attention of the General
Assembly the various concerns that we wish to see
addressed this year.
As the Assembly knows, the Marshall Islands was
chosen for nuclear testing activities for the good of
mankind. It did not turn out to be so fortunate for many of
our people. The testing displaced many, and many were
affected by the contamination. The Marshall Islands
continues to be haunted by a legacy of nuclear testing and
the destruction that accompanied it. My own home island,
Utirik, was severely affected, and as I speak today we feel
that there has not been a full reckoning of this dreadful part
of our history. We have spoken about the medical effects,
the high costs of treating the victims and the costs of
rehabilitating the affected areas. A recent study has proved
that the thyroid cancer rate in the population alive at the
time of the testing is very high. We are experiencing the
effects of these ailments decades after the end of the tests.
The medical and social problems that were caused do not
seem likely to go away.
That being said, there are some positive developments
arising from our talks with our former Administering
Authority. Recent discussions have highlighted the need to
move forward with positive measures, and this is something
we fully support. The problems we face are, however, very
difficult, and the international expertise we require is
simply not forthcoming. We therefore reiterate the call we
made at the 1995 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review
Conference that such expertise for medical measures, as
well as scientific and technical assistance, must be made
available. We have sought to have the year 2000 Review
Conference fully reflect this concern. If these issues are
not addressed, it is our considered view that
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament in general will
be a hollow achievement.
I am grateful, Mr. President, for the efficient manner
in which you conducted the proceedings of the twenty-
second special session. That session will serve as a
highlight among our achievements this year, and I hope
that it will usher in a new dawn of international
cooperation with the small island developing States.
The concerns that were raised at the special session
need not be repeated here. However, we must now look
at how to integrate these concerns into other work of the
United Nations in the field of sustainable development. It
would be counterproductive if the outcomes from last
week were not fully reflected in our other deliberations.
The full agenda before the Second Committee is
indicative of the continued concern with these issues. We
will seek to ensure full reflection of the special session at
the appropriate time. At the national level we will do our
part through the National Commission on sustainable
development. At the regional level we will cooperate with
the other organizations of the Pacific island countries.
The interlinkages between various conventions and
sustainable development efforts have always been clear to
my delegation. We are deeply concerned with climate
change and the devastating effect it may have on our
livelihood, culture, natural resources, the economy and
our very existence. Climate change is with us now. It
must be stressed that bad weather is not climate change.
However, the extreme events that have been observed in
recent years are indications of what is to be expected
from climate change. Climate change is the disease, and
what we are observing are the symptoms.
In the Pacific we have experienced a number of
severe weather events and changes to our normal climate.
Kiribati and the northern Cook Islands have become
wetter, while Fiji and Tonga have become drier. In Samoa
the difference between daytime and night-time
temperatures has decreased. The southern Cook Islands
and Tonga have also become warmer. The drought that
hit the Marshall Islands last year was so bad that
households could not get even two hours of fresh water
per week.
36


For small island developing States it is not just a
question of waiting to see what the research will say. We
have to take action now. What happens to the small islands
will impact on the rest of the world sooner rather than later.
We also expect that the industrialized countries will take
precautionary measures. Anything less is an invitation to
the genocide of island peoples around the world.
The industrialized countries should urgently reduce
their emissions, and others should follow suit. We ourselves
are taking steps to limit our already very small emissions.
Part of our effort is to develop our renewable energy sector.
In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the
Government has approved a solar energy policy. The first
stage will be a project to install solar panels on all the outer
island health centres and one of the high schools. With the
support of the United Nations Trust Fund for New and
Renewable Sources of Energy and the Government of Italy,
we hope to begin implementing this project very soon, as
well as the overall policy. The policy will assist us in
generating sustainable livelihoods in the outer island
communities.
The Marshall Islands was honoured to host the
Alliance of Small Island States workshop on climate change
this year, and we commend the outcome to all
Governments. We would like to express our appreciation to
Italy, Norway, the United States, Canada and Switzerland
for supporting the workshop and the United Nations Trust
Fund for providing the experts.
As the custodian of three-quarters of a million square
miles of ocean, the Marshall Islands is continuing its
endeavours to seek equitable solutions for the governance
of the oceans. We are cognizant that the activities that take
place in our neighbouring seas will have an effect on the
sustainable development of the marine resources within our
exclusive economic zone.
Unsustainable fishing practices such as the use of drift
nets and small mesh sizes must therefore be banned
forever. The Marshall Islands has been working together
with the Pacific island countries to develop a regional treaty
that would address implementation of fisheries conservation
and their sustainable management. Various aspects of
importance include the need for data collection, vessel
monitoring systems, and greater support for our patrol
boats. We also need to look at limiting the fleets permitted
to fish in our waters; this would also assist us in further
developing our domestic fleet.
My Government applauds the efforts of the Pacific
Forum, in particular the Permanent Representative of
Papua New Guinea who, in cooperation with the Rio
Group, has brought this matter forward. We will continue
to seek common-sense solutions to the vexing problems
that confront us in ocean matters.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Marshall
Islands has responsibility for and is predominantly
focused on the social development and improvement in
the lives of our people in the outer island communities.
One such example is the solar power project I mentioned.
We are constantly engaged in seeking solutions to address
these concerns, one such event being national economic
and social summit. Through the outcome of that summit,
we are striving to bring about the partnerships that these
communities require for their economic and social
development. Many exciting new ideas have come
forward, especially for the development of agriculture,
fisheries and sustainable tourism. What is lacking is
concerted donor support, but we are hopeful that with
detailed and pragmatic proposals this situation will
change.
Earlier this year, at the Preparatory Committee for
the follow-up to the Copenhagen Social Summit, I
outlined some of the problems we face and the possible
solutions we proposed. Those ideas are still valid. My
delegation will continue to stress the need for support for
these efforts during this session and at the special session
on social development next year.
Women’s rights are a cornerstone of the Marshall
Islands Constitution. As a matrilineal society, we have a
cultural attachment to the promotion of the rights of all
people, but especially for the women of our society. We
have in place a unit in the Ministry of Internal Affairs to
assist in the implementation of our policy on women and
to address the achievements of women in our society. I
can inform the Assembly that a national caucus of women
was recently established to increase further their
involvement in the political decision-making process. My
delegation will actively participate in the preparatory
work for the special session on the implementation of the
Beijing Conference to be held next year.
Equally important to the Marshall Islands are human
rights in the general sense. We have tried to give practical
implementation to the ideals that we all hold dear. The
Marshall Islands Constitution defines respect for human
rights as the fundamental obligation of the Government.
It sets out the basic parameters for the holding of free
37


elections, the right of free speech and thought, and the right
to economic and social development. We hold these
principles in high regard, and indeed we are currently in the
process of holding general elections to the Parliament and
to the local governments. The elections are free and fair,
and open to the most stringent oversight to ensure there is
no interference in the free choice of the people.
In line with our efforts to consolidate our democracy
and our free institutions, we are looking at the opportunities
in the various human rights instruments of the United
Nations. I hope to be able to report soon that we will
become party to the most important of these instruments,
even though I would contend that our Constitution already
gives full voice to these rights. In this regard, we were very
heartened to hear what the Secretary-General had to say on
the subject. We think that he pinpointed the real issue here:
that it is people who are the most important, that it is
adherence to human rights that we must safeguard. We will
support all efforts to see to it that new initiatives are given
proper consideration.
As a small but determined democracy, the Marshall
Islands supported the inclusion of the agenda item on the
need to examine the exceptional international situation
pertaining to the Republic of China on Taiwan and ensure
that the fundamental right of its 22 million people to
participate in the work and activities of the United Nations
is fully respected. We hope to achieve a resolution of this
matter in the near future. There is still a need for an ad hoc
committee to be established to examine the matter further.
The United Nations has come a long way on the path
to reform, which we all know is an ongoing process, never
a single event. My delegation congratulates the Secretary-
General for his outstanding efforts: he deserves our full
support and thanks. But the reforms so far made are in
jeopardy because of the continued non-payment of
contributions by certain Members. This is intolerable and
cannot continue: the support from Member States cannot
falter. We must all pay our dues on time, in full and
without conditions.
As part of this reform process, we too have noted the
anomalies in the regional groupings here at the United
Nations. We think it is high time to review this matter, as
Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and
Samoa have all eloquently pointed out.
There is also a need to finalize the reform of the
Security Council. In this regard, I wish to thank the
delegation of Italy for its reasonable and logical
contribution to our debate on this matter.
We must also ensure that the United Nations
agencies are responsive to the special needs of the
developing countries. The Marshall Islands has benefited
to some extent from various United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) projects. We feel that more can be
done, and we look forward to increasing our cooperation
with United Nations agencies, such as UNDP, the United
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and others.
In conclusion, Mr. President, you can count on the
full support and cooperation of the Marshall Islands
delegation to assist you in bringing our deliberations to a
fruitful conclusion.





"
3498,54,1999,NZL,"First let me
congratulate you, Sir, the Foreign Minister of Namibia, on
your election as President of the General Assembly this
session. I certainly recall my meetings with you and your
President in your country last year.
I also wish to welcome three new Members to the
United Nations — Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga — all very
close friends and neighbours of New Zealand. I trust that
the faith they have shown in the United Nations will be
fulfilled in the years ahead, and we certainly look forward
to working closely with them.
When addressing this Assembly, especially as a
representative of a smaller Member State, one is reminded
10


that the United Nations must remain the fundamental point
of reference in international relations. Indeed, that is a truth
that all Member States have an obligation to acknowledge.
Furthermore, it is of course sound policy for all who need
and rely on the rule of international law in place of
lawlessness. And it is particularly important to restate it at
this time. The United Nations collective security
framework, which is one of the fundamental elements of
the Charter together with cooperation on economic and
social problems and promoting respect for human rights,
has perhaps never been more severely tested than in this
last year of the twentieth century.
Armed conflicts, many of them internal and ethnically
based, have continued to present a serious moral challenge
to the international community, and they are likely to do so
for the foreseeable future. The Security Council's response
to these problems does not always increase our confidence
in the Organization.
The Secretary-General's remarks in his statement at the
beginning of this debate about the need to reconcile
universal legitimacy with effectiveness in defence of human
rights were most timely. New Zealanders place a very good
deal of faith in the United Nations: when we see on our
television screens evidence of violence and inhumanity
against the vulnerable, and we are told that the Security
Council cannot reach an agreement on collective action, we
are left worried, and wondering whether our trust in the
Security Council is well placed. A Council which loses the
trust of the people is a Council which will become
irrelevant.
I want to talk to the Assembly about two extremely
serious challenges the Council faced this year: Kosovo and
East Timor. Both highlight the importance of the actions of
the Security Council.
In East Timor, following President Habibie's
courageous offer to the East Timorese people, prompt and
effective action was taken by the Security Council to set in
train the popular consultation process. The ballot —
undertaken in extremely difficult circumstances by highly
committed United Nations workers, international and local,
all of whom deserve acclaim — produced a resounding and
incontrovertible expression of the will of the East Timorese
people. This was the essential basis for the international
community's response since the ballot.
Post-ballot events were appallingly tragic and have
rightly provoked a strong reaction around the world. The
dispatch to Jakarta and Dili of the Security Council mission
led by Ambassador Andjaba of Namibia was a key step
in addressing this grievous situation. The efforts made by
representatives of all countries present at the time of the
meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
leaders in Auckland, joined by the British Foreign
Secretary representing the European Union, reinforced the
Secretary-General's urging that Indonesia accept the offer
of international help. The assistance could not have come
too early.
New Zealand is proud to be a contributor, alongside
the forces of other nations from the region and from
further afield, and under the leadership of Australia, to the
United-Nations-authorized multinational force that is now
operating in East Timor. Our soldiers from New Zealand
are on the ground in East Timor right now. We are
prepared also to take part in the United Nations
peacekeeping operation foreshadowed in Security Council
resolution 1264 (1999), and we urge the Council to take
prompt action — next week would not be too soon — to
establish this operation, which would be part of the
United Nations transitional administration in East Timor.
We are contributing to the efforts of humanitarian
agencies to provide support to the hundreds of thousands
of ordinary people who have been displaced in East
Timor; those currently in West Timor should be speedily
repatriated. New Zealand has added its voice to those who
believe that the people responsible for crimes against
humanity in East Timor should be brought to account.
The overriding objective must now be to ensure the
realization of the 30 August ballot outcome and East
Timor's transition to independence. It is clear that in
laying the basis for East Timor's future, the United
Nations will be the indispensable organization.
It is inevitable that comparison will be made
between East Timor and Kosovo. In Kosovo the world
saw a grave humanitarian crisis with the Security Council
unable to act. In New Zealand's view, collective action to
try to put a stop to a humanitarian disaster involving
genocide and the most serious crimes against humanity
should never be held hostage to the veto. When it is, the
Security Council loses its credibility and its relevance. I
need hardly reiterate New Zealand's continuing opposition
to the veto, voiced since San Francisco in 1945. While it
is understandable that national interests will influence
how members vote in the Security Council, we have
never accepted that some narrow interests of any one of
five countries should be able to override the will of a
clear majority of members.



The adoption by the Security Council of its resolution
1244 (1999) of 10 June, which provided the international
community's endorsement of a political solution to the
Kosovo conflict, was certainly greeted with much relief in
most quarters, including in New Zealand. The resolution
was proof, if any were needed, that the United Nations
remains, as in East Timor, the indispensable organization.
And as the Secretary-General observed at the time, it also
gave strong legal underpinning to the task ahead, a task
which, he noted, is daunting. The contribution of the
dedicated United Nations and specialized agency staff who
are now working with little fanfare in Kosovo certainly
deserves our recognition.
Both Kosovo and East Timor have put the Security
Council to the test. In their own ways they have challenged
this Organization's capacity to take effective action in the
face of severe difficulties. The world must never again
witness horrors such as those in Kosovo whilst the Security
Council remains impotent. The case of East Timor shows
that the Security Council can react swiftly and effectively
when the will exists. For this to be possible, the fullest
commitment to support those humanitarian ideals that are
the basis of the United Nations Charter remains essential.
The adoption of the Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court shows such a commitment. The
international community must now deliver on its promise,
with signature and early ratification of that Statute.
As we know, the United Nations also has before it the
pressing demands of the various and sometimes interrelated
conflicts throughout Africa with, of course, their appalling
humanitarian consequences. Who can put out of their minds
the images of atrocities we have seen from Sierra Leone,
for instance? Yet the Council's response has until very
recently been low-level. Once again, the credibility of the
Security Council depends in large part on its being seen as
even-handed in its attention to crises, wherever they may
occur, and whether the Cable News Network (CNN) is
there or not.
For much of the past year we have seen the Council
virtually paralysed on the important question of
disarmaming Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. In the
meantime, this potentially very serious threat to the security
of the region remains unresolved. The reason again has
been the very sharp divisions among the permanent
members, which by virtue of the veto power can block any
action. This situation remains unacceptable.
New Zealand's awareness of the importance of the
role of collective action has also been heightened by
recent events in our own immediate region. Here, the
United Nations demonstrated its ability to respond to the
different demands of supporting the regionally inspired
peace process on the island of Bougainville, part of Papua
New Guinea, and of assessing the needs created by
disruptions to the population on Guadalcanal in the
Solomon Islands.
The United Nations must be capable of responding
effectively. Small and vulnerable nations in particular
need confidence in the United Nations, as it may be their
only hope in times of trouble. I am very concerned
therefore by the apparent trend away from financing new
peacekeeping operations by means of assessed
contributions and an increasing reliance instead on
voluntary funding. This, of course, poses a threat to the
collective responsibility that is at the heart of this
Organization. In practical terms it is likely to mean that
those regions which fail to attract donor support will not
receive the response they are entitled to as Members of
the United Nations. This trend must be urgently reversed;
all operations must be put on an equal financial footing
by means of assessed contributions.
In addition, as I noted here last year, the largest
contributor's arrears to the peacekeeping and regular
budgets continue to cast a long shadow over the
Organization. Outstanding dues and very slow payments
to troop contributors affect us all, and can severely
constrain the ability of countries to contribute to pressing
peacekeeping needs. We call again on those Member
States who are in dereliction of their obligations to make
payment on time, in full and, of course, without
conditions.
Reform of the Security Council remains one of the
most important items on our agenda. Further useful
progress has been made this year. While the issue of
enlargement continues to be complex, we believe there
has existed for some time wide agreement on the equally
important areas of reforming the Council's working
methods and the curtailing of the veto. The linkage
between the veto and enlargement was also explicitly
recognized in this year's report to the General Assembly
of the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of
Equitable Representation on and Increase in the
Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters
Related to the Security Council.
12


As for the task of providing more equitable
representation, I am not convinced that we will be able to
achieve this while the regional groups in the United Nations
continue to reflect the political geography of the 1960s.
Quite different and far more sensible arrangements have
been adopted in other multilateral forums, as, for example,
in the context of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty (CTBT). The present system here in New York
locks in very great disparities in representation. Small
countries that can make an excellent contribution are often
severely disadvantaged, especially where a political bloc
inside a regional group may coordinate closely on electoral
matters.
I would, therefore, wish to add my voice to those of
the Prime Ministers of Fiji and Samoa and the Foreign
Ministers of Papua New Guinea and Australia, who spoke
earlier in this debate on the need for reconfiguration.
Reconfiguration of the regional groups may well hold one
of the keys to an overall package on Security Council
reform.
New Zealand still looks forward to the day when we
can join a regional group here in New York which includes
our Asia-Pacific neighbours. In the meantime, we will
continue to build linkages in our region and developing the
many areas of our common understanding.
One of the great strengths of the General Assembly is
the equal status ascribed to each Member. All Members,
large or small, rich or poor, have a right to be heard here.
Each has a single vote. While we must all from time to
time temper our own national ambitions in the interests of
reaching a common understanding, we respect the point of
view of each individual member. The special session on
small island developing States over the last few days was
a very good opportunity to do just that. New Zealand is
firmly committed to assisting the small island developing
States SIDS in the spirit of common purpose and
partnership envisaged at Barbados five years ago. We are
very pleased that all participants in the special session have
reaffirmed their commitment to implement fully the
Barbados Programme of Action.
In April New Zealand, represented by my colleague,
the Honourable Simon Upton, had the privilege of chairing
the seventh session of the Commission on Sustainable
Development. We were pleased to be able to help
reinvigorate debate and build consensus around the need for
a more coordinated approach to stewardship of the world's
oceans and the need to recognise, in an ongoing way, the
special characteristics and needs of small island
developing States.
The Commission faces the great challenge of
pursuing the implementation of Agenda 21. Two other
great challenges we as a world face on the environmental
front are the threat of global climate change, caused at
least in part by human-induced emissions of greenhouse
gases, and the need to maintain an approach to
international trade and environmental issues which is
based on sound scientific analysis and agreed rules and
procedures. It is vitally important that we should continue
to act in concert to face these international challenges.
International cooperation in addressing economic,
social and humanitarian problems is, and always will be,
one of the cornerstones of the United Nations Charter.
The substantial decline in official development assistance
flows over the last decade is of great concern to many
Member States. In this connection, I am concerned to
note that the core resources of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) have been greatly
reduced over the past five years, to the point where its
universality is seriously threatened. I applaud the efforts
the new administrator is making to turn this situation
around and to put UNDP on a more secure footing, with
more clearly defined priorities.
Private capital flows to developing countries have
shown major increases. There is a tendency, however, for
such investment to be heavily concentrated on a few
countries where investment prospects seem brightest.
Many developing countries remain vulnerable and can be
all too easily marginalized. Official development
assistance continues to be an essential tool to help build
the capacity of countries in sectors such as education so
that they can benefit from the unstoppable phenomenon
of globalization. It is certainly a matter of particular pride
for me, as New Zealand's Foreign Minister, to have
overseen increases in New Zealand's official development
assistance funding effort — up by some 40 per cent since
the time of the Rio Summit in 1992.
I welcome, also, the positive steps that are being
taken on the financing for development and debt-relief
initiatives. It is vital that we continue the dialogue among
Member States and with the international financial
institutions to ensure a sounder basis for meeting the
challenges of international development.
Last year I referred to the important role the United
Nations has to play in shaping the moves towards
13


globalization and the opening up of opportunities for world
trade. Later this year, in Seattle, we expect to launch a new
round of multilateral trade negotiations. This will clearly
provide a forum in which to advance trade liberalization
and the rules-based trading system. The role of these
negotiations in promoting the development prospects of all
countries and in fostering the integration of least developed
countries into the global system will be a particular focus.
Deliberations in this Organization at many levels will help
to advance our people's understanding of the value and
purpose of the global trade agenda and their ability to
benefit from it. However, I would emphasise the
importance of major trading partners in continuing to play
a leadership role. The adoption of trade restrictions and
distortions by wealthy economies does much to erode their
moral authority in the broader debate.
New Zealand continues to attach the utmost
importance to seeing all countries work together to bring
about a world free of nuclear weapons. For this reason we
were a cosponsor last year of the so-called New Agenda
resolution, which called for faster progress towards the
elimination of nuclear weapons. The cosponsors will be
presenting this moderate resolution again this year, and we
urge all countries to look carefully at it.
The Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will meet in
Vienna in a week's time. I would urge all those countries
which have not ratified the Treaty to do so, so that it can
enter into force without further delay.
Strengthening the United Nations remains an important
goal for New Zealand. I take this opportunity to commend
the forward-looking management reforms introduced by the
Secretary-General. They have greatly improved policy
coordination among senior management and have produced
positive, tangible effects throughout the Secretariat.
Improving the way the Organization plans its programmes
and expenditures is a critical next step, where work is
already under way. There must be a greater focus on results
when budgets are prepared in order to promote the best use
of the resources of the Organization, and in turn the best
return for Member States.
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva
Conventions, and last year we commemorated the fiftieth
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Events over the past 12 months have shown that challenges
to the values and principles embodied in the Universal
Declaration remain as daunting as ever. In this
interdependent world in which we live, New Zealand
continues to see the United Nations as central to
international efforts to work together to protect and
promote, for all our people, those fundamental human
rights and freedoms to which we are committed under the
Universal Declaration.
Next year the United Nations will host the
millennium summit. This symbolic event will provide an
excellent opportunity for Member States to reaffirm their
commitment to the ideals of this great Organization.
Recognizing the frailties of our collective performance to
date, and the critical importance of finding workable
solutions for the future, I call on all Member States to
take the opportunities offered by the millennium summit
to enter into open and constructive dialogue and step into
the next millennium with an unequivocal recommitment
to the visionary principles enshrined in the Charter.
It is nine years since I first addressed this body in
1991 as the Foreign Minister of New Zealand. For the
United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, it
has been a tumultuous period. After the cold war the
number of problems multiplied; the world's expectations
of what the United Nations could deliver were raised
above the possible; and the solutions demanded required
determination, resolve, tact, understanding and
imagination. The demands on the United Nations will not
lessen, but each year must see a better performance than
in the past. However, as this may well be the last
statement I make to this body, I want to thank all United
Nations officials and peacekeepers everywhere: those I
have met here in New York; in Cambodia and in
Somalia; in Mozambique; in Bosnia, Croatia and Albania;
in Papua New Guinea and, of course, now in East Timor.
I thank them for their continuing, often unsung and heroic
efforts. They are much appreciated.




"
3502,54,1999,AUS,"May I begin by adding my
congratulations to those of my colleagues on your election,
Sir, as President of the General Assembly at its
fifty-fourth session. You are no stranger to these halls —
you were here first as an observer and later as a
representative. You bring a wealth of experience to your
position, and we are pleased to see Namibia taking
leadership roles in both the General Assembly and the
Security Council.
Before I move to the main substance of my remarks
today, I want to take this opportunity to mention two
matters.
First, I welcome the three new members of the
United Nations: Kiribati, Nauru and Tonga. Having
worked closely with these three countries in our own
Asia-Pacific community, it is a particular pleasure for me,
as the Foreign Minister of Australia, now to have the
opportunity to take that cooperation into this larger family
of nations.
The second matter is one that seized the attention of
the entire Australian population earlier this year: the fate
of two CARE Australia workers, Steve Pratt and Peter
Wallace, who were imprisoned by the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia. Thanks in no small measure to the support
of the international community, Steve and Peter were
released from prison on 1 September. The efforts of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the High Commissioner
for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata and the High Commissioner for
Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, and the continued support
of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs, were invaluable in gaining the
men’s release.
I would also like to thank President Ahtisaari of
Finland, the Greek Government, Nelson Mandela, Pope
John Paul and the many other individuals who generously
lent their support to this cause. The international
community’s cooperation in this case demonstrates the
strong commitment we share to protecting our
humanitarian workers from persecution, and to ensuring
their capacity to carry out their important work in safety.
Australia will continue to support international efforts to
secure the release of Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav national
and an employee of CARE Australia, who continues to
serve time in a Yugoslav prison.
You, Mr. President, take up your responsibilities at
a most auspicious time, as the nations of the world enter
a new millennium. As they do so, it is appropriate for us
to reflect on the past and the future of the United Nations,
what it has achieved and what tasks remain unfulfilled.

Of course, the various aspects of this subject are as
numerous and diverse as the operations of the United
Nations itself, which has evolved from a modest operation
in the early days after the end of the Second World War to
become an Organization that touches on just about every
facet of human existence.
Today I want to concentrate on just two matters. The
first is perhaps the most fundamental task before this
Organization: the maintenance of global peace and security
through humanitarian intervention. This is a subject that has
been at the centre of my own thinking, especially over
recent weeks because of the role Australia has played in the
resolution of the conflict in East Timor. I believe that the
activities of the United Nations in that Territory stand as an
example of the kind of work to which this Organization can
really add value.
The other matter — the reform of the United
Nations — is on the face of it a rather prosaic matter. But,
in truth, reform is the key to every single function of this
Organization, for without it we cannot hope to equip the
United Nations to face the demands of our ever-changing
international environment. The United Nations must change
and adapt, or become increasingly irrelevant.
I turn now to the question of the future of East Timor.
It is now just over a week since the first elements of the
International Force in East Timor (INTERFET) began
arriving in Dili to commence the task set for it under
Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) of 15 September
to restore peace and security in East Timor, to protect and
support the United Nations Mission in East Timor in
carrying out its tasks and, within force capabilities, to
facilitate humanitarian assistance programmes.
I am pleased to report that INTERFET’s deployment
has been smooth and peaceful, and that elements of the
force are now spreading across the territory of East Timor.
It has begun the vital work of bringing peace back to the
troubled island, and of assisting in creating the right climate
for the provision of the food, shelter and medical assistance
that the East Timorese desperately require. This is the latest
chapter in the long association of the United Nations with
East Timor, an association that has lasted for more than a
quarter of a century. The process that has brought us here
has been long and difficult, but at last we may be
approaching a peaceful resolution of the tragedy that has
beset the East Timorese people for so long.
The fact that we have arrived at this point owes much
to President Habibie of Indonesia. It was President Habibie
who led his country down the path of democracy after the
departure of former President Soeharto. Under President
Habibie’s guidance, Indonesia held its first democratic
elections in more than four decades, and it now awaits the
election of its next President. It was also President
Habibie who decided to allow the people of East Timor
to choose between greater autonomy within Indonesia and
independence. Those were momentous decisions —
decisions that reflect the massive strides that Indonesian
society has made in just a few short months. Australia
stood by the Indonesian people as they began their
transition to democracy, and we will continue to do so in
the years ahead.
Regardless of the problems that have beset the
transition process in East Timor, President Habibie and
his administration deserve full credit for actually initiating
that process. I also want to make special mention of the
role played by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in
seeking a peaceful resolution of East Timor's status.
The conclusion on 5 May this year of the tripartite
Agreement among Portugal, Indonesia and the United
Nations owed much to the hard work and perseverance of
the Secretary-General, who helped guide the parties
towards a settlement that provided for a credible and
orderly ballot on East Timor's future. In doing so, he
maintained the honourable tradition of his predecessors as
Secretary-General, who since 1983 had been working with
Portugal and Indonesia towards a comprehensive and just
solution to the region's difficulties.
It would be remiss of me if I did not also mention
the sterling work done both before and after the
conclusion of the Agreement by the Secretary-General's
Personal Representative, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker,
and his deputy, Francesc Vendrell. The work of those two
men was crucial to the successful outcome of the
negotiations and to the holding of the ballot in East
Timor.
Of course, the conclusion of the tripartite Agreement
was just the beginning of the process to allow the East
Timorese to decide their own fate. With the establishment
by the Security Council on 11 June of the United Nations
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), the practical work of
holding the popular consultation got under way. Under the
leadership of Ian Martin, UNAMET began the difficult
and often dangerous task of organizing a vote in only 12
short weeks. Thanks to the enthusiasm and application of
Ian Martin and his team, that task was accomplished with
results that few could have ever dreamed of. The fact that
9


more than 450,000 people were able to register to vote and
that 98.6 per cent of them actually did so is a remarkable
tribute to the courage and the thirst for democracy of the
East Timorese people.
But it is also a tribute to the effectiveness of
UNAMET and its staff, and a fine example of how
effective the United Nations can be in situations of conflict
and transition. The work done by UNAMET staff in the
days before the ballot and in the tragic days following it
deserves our highest praise. Unarmed, in a tense and
emotionally charged atmosphere, they carried out their
duties magnificently. In particular, the military liaison and
civilian police components of UNAMET, led respectively
by Brigadier General Rezaqul Haider of Bangladesh and
Commissioner Alan Mills of Australia, played crucial roles
as the interface between UNAMET and the Indonesian
police and military authorities.
UNAMET carried out its work at great risk to the staff
involved, and, tragically, several locally engaged employees
paid for their dedication with their lives. That fact is a stark
reminder of the great personal cost that is often associated
with United Nations operations, and a reminder to us all of
the need to make the security and personal safety of United
Nations staff one of our most urgent priorities. The United
Nations must rely on its staff to carry out its various
mandates. A threat to the person of a United Nations staff
member must be treated as a threat against the United
Nations itself.
It is a matter of unfortunate record that the upsurge of
violence in East Timor after the ballot on 30 August swept
up not just United Nations staff members, but hundreds and
maybe thousands of East Timorese. The world has
witnessed the most horrible cruelty visited on the island's
population by people who were unwilling to accept the
outcome of the vote. To the great credit again of President
Habibie, he sought military assistance through the Security
Council. In response, the Security Council delivered a
strong resolution and a positive mandate for peacekeeping
operations, a mandate that will ensure that the will of the
East Timorese people, as expressed in the 30 August vote,
will be carried out.
We in Australia have been very heartened by the
positive international response to the call for military forces
to make up the international force in East Timor and its
successor peacekeeping force. As I have mentioned, the
international forces under the command of Major-General
Peter Cosgrove, have begun to restore order in East Timor.
There are currently some 3,200 personnel on the ground,
drawn from a range of countries, with strong
representation from our own Asia-Pacific region. The
large number of countries participating in the force, and
their wide geographical representation, is evidence of the
widespread international determination to see a peaceful
and orderly transition in East Timor's status.
I am also very pleased to note that UNAMET
personnel have now returned to the island, and will be
able to continue their important work.
In discussing the activities of the United Nations in
East Timor, I must also mention the humanitarian work
done by United Nations agencies. Mrs. Sadako Ogata, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has
travelled to West Timor to examine the plight of East
Timorese refugees in that territory, and Australia fully
supports her efforts.
Australia is also the staging point for humanitarian
assistance operations being carried out by agencies such
as the World Food Programme and the United Nations
Children's Fund. Additional relief efforts are also planned
by the World Health Organization and the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Australia
has already pledged $7 million towards the humanitarian
efforts of United Nations agencies and other
organizations.
The United Nations is also seeking to address the
human rights violations that have been widespread in East
Timor. Security Council resolution 1264 (1999) called on
those responsible for violence in East Timor to be brought
to justice. Australia supports efforts by the Indonesian
Government and the United Nations to bring to account
those responsible for the grievous acts of criminal
violence visited upon the East Timorese people, and will
offer all appropriate assistance in this regard.
More generally, there is now an urgent need to move
as soon as possible to the third phase of the United
Nations plan for East Timor. This will require all parties,
most especially Indonesia and Portugal, to work closely
with the Secretariat. Australia will do what it can to assist
in this process, which will build the foundation for the
transition in the territory's status.
In its activities in East Timor, the United Nations
has demonstrated some of its fundamental strengths as an
organization. It is helping to bring about the resolution of
an international problem that had been festering for a
quarter of a century. It provided the infrastructure that
10


allowed a free and fair expression of the will of the East
Timorese people. And when the security situation could not
be controlled, it facilitated the creation of an international
force to put the transition process back on track and end
gross violations of human rights.
I have been struck by the deep historical resonances of
this process, for when the United Nations was established
at the end of the Second World War, part of its rationale as
an organization was to have been the impartial and
objective resolution of international problems, free of the
old cycles of retribution through resort to aggression. The
ancient resort to armed force and the notion that might was
right were to have been overturned, and in their place the
community of nations was to cooperate to settle
international disputes and solve global problems. The world,
having won a victory over nazism, was determined that
similar evils would never again prevail.
Well, we have seen plenty of occasions in the past 50
years where practice has not measured up to the ideals. But
every now and then, the process works, and I believe that
many elements of the work of the United Nations in East
Timor are evidence of that. Of course, that is not to say
that the process cannot be improved; of course it can. But
if we can identify and build upon the positive elements of
our East Timor experience, I believe that we can not only
improve the situation of the people of that territory, but
may also be able to provide a speedier and more thorough
resolution of other international crises in the future.
We need also to draw lessons from the negative
aspects of events in East Timor. Through our efforts there,
we have shown what the United Nations can do well. Let
us build on that effectiveness, and strive for an organization
that is even more relevant to global peace and security in
the next millennium.
I now turn to another aspect of increased
effectiveness: the question of United Nations reform. In a
recent report on preparations for the Millennium Assembly
and the millennium summit, the Secretary-General
described the United Nations as a unique institution. No
one could disagree that the contribution of the United
Nations to the pursuit of peace and security, to the
economic and social advancement of all peoples and to the
promotion of human rights over the last 50 years or so has
been not just of enormous value, but also truly unique in
world history.
The twenty-first century, however, will bring with it
new challenges and, I hope, new opportunities.
Under the direction of Kofi Annan, this Organization
has begun the important and necessary steps to equip
itself to face these challenges through genuine
administrative and management reform. This has included
promising changes in financial and personnel practices,
significant economies, improving coordination between
United Nations bodies, significant rationalization of
Secretariat structures and more efficient use of
technology. Such reforms make the work of the United
Nations more efficient and provide real savings for the
Organization. Those savings can then be used for other
programmes that benefit all Member States, but
particularly the developing Members of the United
Nations.
The challenge for the United Nations — and, let us
all recognize its Member States — is to ensure that this
momentum is sustained and taken forward. A former
Australian Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, said over
40 years ago that “when we talk of the United Nations,
we should remember what it is in fact, and not be led off
by dreams of what we would like it to be in another kind
of world.”
We need to accept that the United Nations exists in
a real world and be realistic about what it can achieve.
We need to ensure that the Organization's structures and
processes better reflect the realities of the twenty-first
century. We need an expanded, more representative and
more transparent Security Council, and an electoral group
system which reflects the geo-political and economic
realities of today rather than the early nineteen sixties. To
achieve real reforms on these and other subjects, Member
States must work together in a sustained and cooperative
manner. And they must also demonstrate their
commitment to the Organization by paying their
contributions on time and in full.
Reform of the United Nations means building a
stronger and more effective Organization that can deliver
on its commitments to the world's people. It means less
waste and more practical activities. It means developing
an Organization that is equipped to meet whatever
challenges the new century may bring.
Ultimately, it means creating a United Nations that can
maintain its relevance when many national and
international institutions are falling by the wayside, made
obsolete by the rapid pace of change.
I want to conclude my remarks with a call for the
United Nations to concentrate on building on its strengths.
I have mentioned the need to stick with a programme of



thorough and fundamental reform, for that is a basic
prerequisite for the continued effectiveness of the
Organization. But I have also mentioned the United Nations
work in East Timor as an example of how the Organization
can, and does, make a real difference in the resolution of
complex and challenging foreign policy and humanitarian
problems. Not only was the United Nations able to
administer a ballot in circumstances in which many
observers thought the task impossible, but it was also able
to provide for the insertion of a peacekeeping force when
law and order broke down. Those who wished to
exterminate an entire community were foiled.
Those are great strengths. But we need to be able to
consolidate them to make the United Nations a more
effective Organization. We must, for example, be able to
ensure that the United Nations can intervene quickly when
rapidly deteriorating conditions threaten entire nations. That
was the lesson of Rwanda. I was struck by the comments
made by the Secretary-General on this subject when he
addressed the Assembly last week. As the Secretary-
General suggests, changing international circumstances —
including the spread of notions of individual rights and the
idea that the international community has a responsibility to
respond effectively to humanitarian crises — are
challenging traditional notions of national sovereignty. The
United Nations needs to focus on these challenges and
begin the process of defining when and how the
Organization should act in the face of humanitarian crises.
It may be an old cliché to say that the world is
growing ever smaller, but it is true just the same. In days
gone by, the nations of the world may have been forgiven
if they acted too slowly in the face of a humanitarian crisis.
Tales of atrocities, famine and natural disaster took weeks
or months to filter out from the more inaccessible areas of
the globe. Today, those same stories are likely to be on
television screens within hours, or even minutes.
In the face of such indisputable evidence,
Governments will be forced to act. Those that resist will
have to face a domestic and international audience as well
informed as they. That is the kind of environment in which
the United Nations will increasingly have to function,
where the results of inaction will be seen instantly and the
consequences of failure subject to instant and very telling
scrutiny.
Some will be concerned about interference in national
sovereignty, and obviously that is an important and
legitimate concern. Others will say that the greater principle
is that of natural human solidarity. But whatever view is
correct, this environment is a fact we now have to deal
with, whether we like it or whether we don't. When we
all gather here in New York each year, it is easy to get
caught up in the daily business of the United Nations, in
the resolutions, the committee meetings, the briefings and
the caucusing.
How often do we stop, and remind ourselves of the
purposes for which we meet? If we genuinely wish to
uphold the Charter, if we really do want to maintain
international peace and security, help develop our
economic and social strengths and promote respect for
human rights and fundamental reforms, surely we can
start by upholding the most basic right of all, that of life.
In the face of acts of genocide, or of human rights
abuses on a horrendous scale, the nations of the world
must act. I am a firm realist when it comes to foreign
policy, but am also a great believer in the value of
idealism. More than 50 years ago, our predecessors
created the United Nations in the firm hope that there
could be a new international order to replace the old, a
spirit of cooperative international action that could avoid
the competition and aggression that caused two world
wars.
As we approach the end of this century, it is true
that the United Nations has not lived up to all the hopes
of its founders. But the great promise of the Organization
remains. The United Nations response to developments in
East Timor has shown just what positive action on the
part of this Organization can accomplish. We know the
great things this body can achieve. Let us all try to build
on those achievements, so that we may create an
Organization that can truly address the most pressing
problems of the international community. We can build an
active and practical United Nations to meet both the
aspirations of its Member nations and, also, the legitimate
needs of all humanity.


"
3516,54,1999,VUT,"On behalf of the people and the
Government of the Republic of Vanuatu, I wish to join
previous speakers in congratulating you, Mr. President, on
your election to this high and important post. Your
unanimous election as President of the fifty-fourth session
of General Assembly shows the esteem in which the
international community holds both you, personally, and
your country, Namibia. The Republic of Vanuatu’s
delegation is confident that you will guide the session to a
successful conclusion.
May I take this opportunity, through you, to express
my delegation’s sincere appreciation on your predecessor,
His Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti of Uruguay, for his
outstanding stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-
third session.
I wish to commend our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi
Annan, for his wise leadership and dedication to the reform
and restructuring of our Organization. Through you,
Mr. President, we would like to assure him of our support.
Four years ago, we gathered here to celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary of our Organization — in particular, to
renew our commitment to the fundamental principles which
created it in 1945.
We have also made strong a commitment to further
strengthen our collaborative and genuine efforts in ensuring
that this Organization continues to promote global peace,
justice, healthy environment, human rights, law and order,
and support the process of sustainable development of its
Member nations — in particular, the least developed
countries (LDCs) such as those in the Pacific region,
including the Republic of Vanuatu.
The current international political and economic
situation has grown ever more complex and demanding on
our very limited and scarce resources as well as on the
support available from our development partners.
We are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation
of international crimes of all sorts — drug trafficking,
money laundering, human rights violations, terrorism,
organized crime and other similar activities which have the
potential of placing the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of small island States at great risk. The
international community must be seen to genuinely
collaborate in combating these criminal phenomena if the
new philosophy of globalization is to positively progress
and if we are to advance into the new millennium with
fresh and renewed hope to build a better future for our
children.
We do not believe that the world is doing us justice
and the fundamental principles of peace and economic
prosperity as enshrined in the Charter if we do not
observe our joint call for disarmament of nuclear weapons
and other weapons of mass destruction. International
security cannot be guaranteed if we fail to accord priority
attention and resources to education, protection of the
environment and good Heath of humankind and its
survival into the next millennium.
As a small island developing State where the ocean
provides one of the most important parts of our food
chain, we would like to join others in voicing our main
concern regarding the management of our oceans and
seas. Our participation at the Second London Oceans
Workshop last December demonstrated this. We would
therefore join other nations in calling for a collective
affirmation by all respective Member States at this session
of the General Assembly for a resolution to establish a
consultative process to improve coordination and
management of programmes that are associated with the
protection of the oceans and the seas which are very dear
to our very survival. This year my Government acceded
to and ratified three International Maritime Organization
Conventions which again reflects our concern for the
protection of our oceans and seas.
The momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of our
Organization, and the lessons we have learned from past
mistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us in
our pursuit for a better world where, through this
Organization, a renewed sense of mutual trust and
genuine dialogue can he resurrected to ease the political
tensions and economic crisis in all the regions and
sub-regions of the planet.
For our part of the world, these new developments
constitute a real threat to the already vulnerable
environment of our small island economies and our
population. Confronted with these challenges, many
13


countries in the Pacific Region, including Vanuatu, do not
have much choice at the end of the century but to embark
on difficult programmes of reform, both within their
respective Governments and societies.
Last year, The Honourable Donald Kalpokas Masike
Vanua, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, informed the Assembly
that Vanuatu had initiated a Comprehensive Reform
Programme with the support of both multilateral and
bilateral donor agencies and countries. As we are still in the
implementation stage of our reform, it is our genuine hope
that it will not only be beneficial to our people but also
responsive to their needs, in particular those of the 80 per
cent who live in the rural areas on subsistence farming.
Therefore Vanuatu would continue to need the special
support being accorded to it as a least developed country.
The role of Mr. Gurirab’s predecessor and of the
Secretary-General in subsequently facilitating a constructive
dialogue and comprehensive appreciation of the economic
hardships of Vanuatu must be commended, and it is our
hope that this will continue as we enter the new
millennium.
In this regard, the Government and the people of
Vanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of the
Economic and Social Council, at its recent meeting in
Geneva this year, to defer consideration of Vanuatu’s
graduation from least developed country status, pending full
assessment of the usefulness of the vulnerability index and
ecological fragility as criteria for least developed country
designation.
In this connection, I am pleased to inform the
Assembly that with the assistance of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), my
Government will be carrying out a review of our situation
in Vanuatu which we hope will assist the Committee for
Development Planning in its endeavour to come up with
criteria that will hopefully be accepted and adopted to
determine the status of most least developed countries. We
would like to register our most sincere appreciation and
recognition to each and every country and group of
countries for their continuous support.
One of the commitments we all made during the
fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was that our
Organization ought to be reformed and restructured in a
manner that reflects reality and the problems we are
currently experiencing, so that it could be effective in
addressing the issues and needs of its Member States, both
individually and as a group. On this note, we want to
associate ourselves with earlier statements in reference to
reform and restructuring, in particular on the issue of
geographical location. Here we are referring specifically
to our close neighbours, Australia and New Zealand,
which are considered as part of the Asia-Pacific region.
From our perspective — shared, we have no doubt,
by others — the United Nations must include in its
reform agenda a full assessment and recognition of the
inherent particularities of small island States like the
Republic of Vanuatu and the impact of the international
economic crisis, in particular that of globalization, on
their economic performance and on the sustainability of
their political stability.
The pursuit and promotion of a free and responsible
press, the protection of individual rights and gender
equality, as noted in Mr. Gurirab’s opening remarks, are
matters which are receiving more attention under the
reform programme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu
today, but they are challenges which we are confident we
will successfully address over time, with the necessary
support of the international community.
The right of self-determination must also continue to
occupy our agenda. As the United Nations International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism ends next year,
it is my Government’s hope that all administering Powers
of the countries concerned will take appropriate steps, in
cooperation with the territories, to work out some time-
frame for those countries to exercise their inalienable
right self-determination, self-government or independence.
The United Nations, as mandated by its Charter, must be
seen to encourage and support dialogue at the appropriate
political levels in the regions and countries where human
suffering and social disorder continue as a direct result of
conflicts of opinion on the issue of self-determination.
In the Pacific region, while we warmly welcomed
the signing last year of the Nouméa Accord between the
French Government and the major political parties in New
Caledonia, we urge all parties concerned to uphold their
commitment in relation to the rights and wishes of the
indigenous population of New Caledonia. We welcome
the decision by the French Government to allow
representatives from the South Pacific Forum and
representatives of the United Nations Special Political and
Decolonization Committee to visit the Territory in August
of this year, as outlined in resolution 53/65. We believe
this new agreement and the latest developments will help
to foster a stronger sense of commitment in all parties to
work together to support an irreversible trend for the
14


future political status of New Caledonia — that is, its
self-determination.
Still in our region, while the East Timorese people
have finally realized their right to self-determination, my
Government notes with grave concern the deteriorating
situation in East Timor following the results of the ballot at
the end of August in which many human rights violations
have been noted and many innocent people have lost their
lives. However, my Government is pleased to note the
initiatives taken by the Government of Indonesia to allow
the deployment of a Security Council peacekeeping force in
the troubled area and to assist in restoring normalcy and
allowing the democratic process to take its course.
As I said earlier on, the world and our Organization
will be going through very challenging times as we prepare
to turn the page of this century and start a new one. The
credibility of the United Nations in the next millennium
will be measured in terms of its effectiveness in responding
to the real situations prevailing in its Member States,
especially in small island States. The recent admission of
our Pacific Island neighbours, namely the Republic of
Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga,
to this body is a manifestation of this, and we hope that
their admission not only increases the membership of the
United Nations but also that they will bring with them new
ideas to contribute to this important Organization. As small
island States, we feel that our problems will be addressed
adequately and be heard in an international Organization
like the United Nations, and we join others in welcoming
them to our family of nations.
To conclude, let me say that it is therefore vital that
we all support and supplement the process of reform
spearheaded by our Secretary-General, which is aimed not
only at streamlining our Organization but also at
strengthening it. As we approach the dawn of the new
millennium, with its unforeseen challenges, cooperation will
no doubt be required between all Members in order that we
may discuss and debate our common issues in this very
venue.








"
3544,54,1999,PNG,"On
behalf of the people and the Government of Papua New
Guinea, I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating
His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab on his election to
the presidency of the General Assembly. His unanimous
election shows the esteem in which the international
community holds him personally, and his country,
Namibia. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident
that he will guide the fifty-fourth session of the General
Assembly to a successful conclusion. My congratulations
go also to the other Assembly officers.
May I also take this opportunity to express my
delegation's sincere appreciation to his predecessor, His
Excellency Mr. Didier Opertti, for his outstanding
stewardship in facilitating the work of the fifty-third
session.
We would also like to place on record our
appreciation to the Secretary-General for his diplomatic
skill and for the leadership he has provided on major
issues of international concern. I must also congratulate
the Secretariat staff for the tremendous work they put into
the discharge of their functions and duties, at times under
very difficult and dangerous circumstances.
Like others who have spoken before me, I too
congratulate on behalf of the people and the Government
17


of Papua New Guinea the three new Member States, all
from the South Pacific Forum region — the Republic of
Nauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga
— and welcome them into the United Nations family. I
would also like to pay tribute to all Member States which
made their admission possible. This is an Organization in
which smallness in terms of population or size should not
be a handicap. I am confident that the work of the United
Nations will only be enhanced through the sharing of the
particular experiences and knowledge that these three new
Members will bring.
It has only been a little over two months since the new
Government, of which I am a part, was elected to office in
my country. But this time has been hectic and very
challenging. The Government has been confronted with
problems inherited from previous Governments over the last
23 years of our independence and especially over the last
two years. These have been compounded by other problems
associated with the recent downturn in the global economy,
with the economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific region and with
natural disasters, all of which we have little control over.
This experience, together with my country's location
and its close relations with other countries in the region,
defines my Government's foreign policy focus on
partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. This point has been
brought home by a series of natural disasters which have
affected Papua New Guinea over the last 10 years. There
have been 30 of them in that decade. The droughts, floods,
bush fires, cyclones, frosts, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
tsunamis and landslides have shown that peoples and States
throughout the world have to be partners in dealing with the
causes and consequences of such disasters, and must
manifest preparedness to take responsive and remedial
measures. There must be a global partnership in developing
appropriate mechanisms for disaster prevention and disaster
reduction.
When my Government came into office on 14 July
this year, it had five main priorities. These are: restoring
integrity to the institutions of the State; stabilizing the
exchange rate of our currency, the kina, and containing
inflation and reestablishing constructive dialogue with
Papua New Guinea's development partners; restoring
stability to the national budget, focusing on fewer and more
important priority areas and advancing the privatization of
some of our public institutions for a fair run; creating better
conditions for the private sector by removing barriers to
investment growth; and continuing the Bougainville peace
process.
My Government has addressed these challenges,
including a comprehensive programme of structural
adjustment through the mini-budget recently adopted by
Parliament. In doing so, we are working hard to make
sure that a strong and efficient private sector can
contribute to public welfare and national development. By
the same token we are also reviewing the size and
effectiveness of the public sector to make it more
responsive to the desires and aspirations of our people.
The results, together with other measures we have
adopted, will, we hope, stabilize the economy, thereby
stimulating economic growth. The signs are very
encouraging.
I know that as a small open economy, my country's
development is directly influenced by global factors,
including world market prices for our products. Currently,
my country is suffering from the economic crisis
experienced by our major trading partners in Asia, and we
are forced to undertake significant reform programmes to
protect our economy and our people. In this regard, we
turn to international financial institutions to help us
restructure our economy. The World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development
Bank have been very positive in their responses to our
policies, especially my Government's recent mini-budget
last month.
I held bilateral discussions with friends such as
Australia, China, Japan and New Zealand two weeks ago
during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council
ministerial meeting in Auckland, New Zealand. They
indicated their support for the current structural
adjustment programmes my Government has introduced.
For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain its current
reform programmes, it has to secure external financial
support.
I see my Government's foreign policy of partnership
in the Asia-Pacific region as a building block for the
global partnership on which the future of my people
depends. There is really no other alternative.
On peacemaking and peacekeeping, the Bougainville
conflict involves substantial commitments of personnel
and funds by the Government of Papua New Guinea, by
neighbouring countries and by the United Nations. My
Government acknowledges and is deeply grateful for the
constructive role played by Australia, Fiji, New Zealand,
the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as well as by the
United Nations Development Programme and a number of
non-governmental organizations including churches and
18


the Red Cross. We are also grateful that the Security
Council found it possible to answer our request to send an
observer mission to ensure that the parties involved in the
peace process continue to honour the Lincoln Agreement.
We note the reference to Bougainville in the Secretary-
General's report on the work of the Organization.
As peace continues to be consolidated on the ground,
so the role and size of the neutral regional Peace
Monitoring Group can be expected to change. Re-
establishment of police, courts and correctional services will
provide important supports and benchmarks for progress
towards lasting peace on the island. In the event that the
Bougainville parties are unable to resolve the constitutional
arrangements before the end of this year, we hope that at
the appropriate time the Security Council will agree to an
extension of the mandate of the United Nations mission on
Bougainville.
I pay tribute to all United Nations Member States, and
especially to those current and immediate past members of
the Security Council, for responding positively and for their
continued support for a peaceful resolution of our
Bougainville crisis.
Consistent with our commitment to peaceful dialogue
between nations, Papua New Guinea condemns those who
employ terrorism against innocent people and who finance,
recruit, train and deploy terrorists and mercenaries.
In 1975, when I addressed this forum from this
podium at the time of our admission to the United Nations,
I committed Papua New Guinea to the principles and
purposes of the United Nations Charter. Now, some 24
years later, we recognize that like any other institution, the
United Nations has limitations. We believe that after 50
years the time is right to review the Charter, taking into
account today's realities.
The Charter should be a document that puts the people
of the world on centre stage, and at the same time it must
recognize that the Governments are here to represent them
as well as to serve them. In this respect, there cannot be
any distinction as to colour, creed, race, sex or religious
persuasion.
My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General's
current and ongoing reform programme. As a member of
the Non-Aligned Movement, my delegation reaffirms the
position that the Security Council should be reformed and
expanded in both categories, taking into account today's
realities. My delegation believes the numbers in the Council
should reflect the increased United Nations membership,
and therefore I concur with the majority of Member
States who have advocated a Security Council of the new
millennium consisting of 26 or more members.
Papua New Guinea believes that all permanent
members of the Security Council, including new
permanent members, should have similar privileges and
rights. The use of the veto power should be done away
with, or curtailed and applied only to Chapter VII issues.
The working methods of the Council should be more
transparent.
The reforms of the Organization would not be
complete without the reconfiguration of the regional
groupings within the United Nations structure. My
Government believes that an effective Security Council
should be composed of a representative from each
subregion of the world. In this regard, due consideration
should be given to current realities, especially to the
geographical location of each Member State. For example,
in the reformulation Australia and New Zealand should be
considered as part of the South Pacific subregion of the
Asian group. The reforms in the Security Council should
therefore take account of this change.
Changing the world, through decolonization, from a
system of relations between imperial powers and the
colonized to a partnership between sovereign States is
among the United Nations greatest achievements. The
process, however, will not be complete until the
remaining 17 non-self-governing territories have exercised
their inalienable right to self-determination and/or
achieved self-government and, where appropriate,
independence. Neither small size nor remoteness should
be allowed to qualify or limit this inalienable right.
On the regional front, Papua New Guinea is pleased
to note the progress made in implementing the Matignon
Accords, culminating in the recent agreement contained
in the Noumea Accord, which confirms the way forward
for the exercise of the right of self-determination by the
people of New Caledonia, especially the indigenous
Kanak people. The Noumea Accord will, we believe,
provide a sound basis for the future fulfilment of all
legitimate political aspirations. We urge all parties to
honour both its letter and spirit.
We acknowledge that the United Nations Decade for
Decolonization will come to an end next year. We urge
the administering Powers and the members of the Special
19


Committee to work together to develop a new programme
of action for the year 2000 and beyond.
On East Timor, my Government welcomed the
agreement between the Republic of Indonesia, the
Portuguese Republic and the United Nations on 5 May
1999, which enabled the United Nations to organize the
ballot on 30 August. The overwhelming 98.6 per cent
turnout at the ballot and the 78.2 per cent vote in favour of
independence are very clear.
My Government calls on all parties to respect the
results of the United Nations-supervised ballot and the
wishes of the East Timorese people. Although since the
ballot there have been deaths, massive destruction of
property and the undemocratic and forced displacement of
people by the militias and certain members of the
Indonesian military who did not accept the results, we are
pleased that this has changed after the recent announcement
by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, B. J.
Habibie, reaffirmed by Foreign Minister Alatas yesterday.
Democracy is all about the will of the majority. It is not
about unanimity, nor is it about enforced application of
rules by a minority.
We are also pleased that the Government of Indonesia
was able to recognise its obligations — not only as a party
to the 5 May Agreement, but also as a Member of the
United Nations — to permit the deployment of a Security
Council-sanctioned multinational peacekeeping force in East
Timor.
At the same time, however, it is our fervent hope that
in the interests of the long-term security and stability of the
region, the leaders and the people of East Timor will also
make peace with their neighbours. It is important for them
to acknowledge the fact that it was the Government of
Indonesia that made it possible for the people to exercise
their right to self-determination.
We are firmly committed to the Barbados Programme
of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States, including issues of climate change and
the consequent effects of rising sea levels. We strongly urge
its full implementation. My Government will continue to
follow and support the future work on these issues,
including the special session of the General Assembly on
small island developing States to be held on 27 and 28
September 1999. The world's leading scientists have
concluded that the rise in global temperatures poses serious
threats, including sea-level rise and an increase in natural
catastrophes such as the El Niño and La Niña phenomena.
The greatest challenge for the United Nations is to
strengthen the global community's capacity to respond
promptly and effectively to natural disasters. The
devastation caused by the recent earthquakes in Taiwan
and Turkey and by the floods in the United States and in
the Bahamas resulting from hurricane Floyd makes it all
the more imperative for the international community to
take positive action.
On the question of the management of the oceans
and seas, Papua New Guinea joins others in calling on
Member States at this session of the General Assembly to
work together on a resolution to establish a consultative
process to improve coordination and management of the
programmes for the protection of the oceans and seas. At
this Assembly session we should formalize this process.
We are concerned that at the recent meeting of the
Council of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica,
a number of States appeared to be more preoccupied with
reducing our potential to prosper from prospecting,
exploring and exploiting the deep seabed. The debate in
Jamaica clearly reflected that the States with stringent
environmental guidelines no longer endorse the principle
of a global commons. They now find themselves caught
up in a conflict of interest in which their role as guardians
of the global commons is now being overshadowed by
their desire to grab the benefits for themselves, with little
or no sense of obligation to the world community at
large.
We have also noted a tendency by countries that
have co-sponsored pioneer investors in deep-sea mining
to try to avoid their international obligations towards the
environment. We are particularly concerned that they have
placed the interests of investors above the interests of the
global community. We make particular mention of the
trend to withhold information from the International
Seabed Authority under the guise of “confidentiality”,
“proprietary interests”, and “information of a scientifically
sensitive nature”: these are merely codes for denying
global communities access to information that might
allow them to prepare better for disaster prevention and
other actions needed to protect the environment.
Regarding nuclear issues, Papua New Guinea,
consistent with our shared commitment to a stable,
peaceful and environmentally safe world, supports the
objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty. Together with our partners in the South
Pacific Forum, we continue to reaffirm our commitment
20


to maintaining the South Pacific region as a nuclear-
weapon-free zone. We also express our support for the
other regional nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa, South-
East Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, and also
for the proposed new initiatives for Central and South Asia.
We call on all nuclear-weapon and threshold States to
stop all testing, manufacturing and stockpiling of these
weapons and to take steps towards the destruction of all
nuclear weapons. Indeed, the same principle should apply
to all weapons of mass destruction.
The South Pacific Forum members have always
maintained that we have a right to ban transboundary
movements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes,
within and through the region. We also continue to share
the position that appropriate compensatory mechanisms
should be established to compensate victims of past nuclear
tests and provide compensation for damage resulting from
any accidents.
In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm that Papua New
Guinea is firmly committed to the United Nations Charter;
to the reforms initiated by the Secretary-General, especially
those relating to the Security Council and the
reconfiguration of the regional groups within the United
Nations system; and to the United Nations decolonization
process and the Nouméa Accord for the Kanak people of
New Caledonia. We support the determination of the United
Nations to work towards a global mechanism for natural-
disaster preparedness and prevention; the special session of
the General Assembly for the review and appraisal of the
implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for
the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States; and the management of the oceans and seas.
Partnership in promoting change is the key to
addressing the challenges that the world will face in the
twenty-first century. I believe that the challenge for all
Member States is to join together to bring about
transparency, accountability and good governance as the
basic tenets of this Organization, its organs and subsidiary
bodies. If this is achieved, the “people first” sentiment of
the United Nations Charter will be truly embraced.








"
3622,54,1999,PLW,"Let me first congratulate
you, Sir, on your unanimous election as President of the
General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. We likewise
extend our appreciation to Mr. Didier Opertti, the
President of the Assembly at its fifty-third session. We
wish also to convey our appreciation and thanks to His
Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his leadership in
promoting the objectives and the mission of the United
Nations.
I wish to convey the warm greetings of President
Kuniwo Nakamura, the entire leadership and the people
of the Republic of Palau to the Assembly on the occasion
of the fifty-fourth session. On behalf of the Government
and the people of Palau, I extend our sincere appreciation
to the members of this body for their assistance.
Since attaining membership of the United Nations in
1994, the Republic of Palau has benefitted greatly from
a variety of United Nations-sponsored programmes and
from international cooperation, which have helped us play
our role in promoting peace and democracy in our region.
This year, on 1 October, we proudly celebrate the fifth
anniversary of our independence, which came about as a
result of a unique and very successful political treaty with
the United States of America under the Compact of Free
Association. Diplomatic relations and economic
cooperation with a growing number of members of this
body assure stability and promise great economic
potential for the future.


Before I proceed, let me take this rare opportunity to
welcome three of our regional neighbours — the Republic
of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of
Tonga — and to congratulate them on joining this
important Organization.
Palau also expresses its appreciation and support for
the efforts of the Security Council in promoting peace,
security and the protection of human rights and democracy
throughout the world, and especially in troubled areas in
need of United Nations intervention.
Today we have less than 100 days left before entering
the new millennium — 97 days to be exact. There are
indeed many global issues and problems that certainly
deserve our attention. The existence of the Earth in the next
millennium may, however, be in great jeopardy if the
environment and nature's forces can no longer support the
human population. Global warming or climate change may
merit the upmost attention and our concerted effort. I call
upon every Member State, large and small, developed and
developing, rich and poor, to work cooperatively to find
meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this
growing international problem and challenge. I am
confident that through sharing information on climate
change we can learn from one another and take the
necessary steps to meet this very dangerous global problem.
Let me share a Palauan proverb with the Assembly,
one that foreshadows climate change. In Palau the winds
are mainly from the east or from the west. When there are
easterly winds, the sky is not so telling before the rain. As
the rain commences, one may think it is just a light shower.
However, it actually comes in a downpour. In the old days
our raincoat was simply several leaves sewn together and
put over our heads. So we would get soaked through and
through during this downpour. The message is: do not
underestimate the easterly winds, or you will get deluged
with water.
That is our message from yesterday, and it is our
message today: do not take climate change lightly, or there
will be dire consequences. Climate change for small island
nations such as the Republic of Palau has great
consequences because of our fragile ecosystem. To expand
on just a few examples, the El Niño phenomenon, which
impacted many communities throughout the globe, had far-
reaching and devastating effects in Palau as well. At least
one third of all our hard coral communities died. Our reefs
are home to over 500 species of corals and 1,500 species of
fish, and are vibrant with marine life. The loss of our coral
communities effects our entire ecosystem and eventually
our people and their economic livelihoods. The El Niño
phenomenon also caused extreme drought that dried up
our main water reservoir and destroyed over 1,400
patches of our most important root crop, taro, which of
course added another burden to our daily lives.
Palau and our Pacific region are also suffering from
unusually high rises in tide tables, causing our farmlands
to be infiltrated with salt water that eventually will have
dire effects on our crops. This high sea level rise has
literally caused islands to disappear, and others are in
imminent danger of disappearing. Abnormally warm
ocean temperatures have also caused extensive coral
bleaching, and rising atmospheric temperatures devastate
agriculture. According to the 1999-2000 World
Development Report, a 1 metre sea level rise due to
climate change would force about 70 million people to
move, and would have a dramatic effect on food security
in central Asia and the Pacific. Many other examples
exist, I am sure.
These few examples, and examples in other
countries, beg for global cooperation on climate change.
The Republic of Palau recognizes the link between
climate change and biodiversity, and is committed to
preserving our biodiversity. Protecting our forests is one
of the most effective mechanisms to slow climate change.
Forests, as we know, are carbon sinks, which absorb
carbon dioxide rather than releasing it as a harmful
greenhouse gas. Because of this, the destruction of forest
has a dramatic impact on climate change. The Republic
of Palau has taken responsibility for its forests through
the National Forest Act and Mangrove Management Plan.
Progress is being made on national regulations requiring
protective vegetative zones along our wetland and coastal
areas. The Republic of Palau sponsors a summer tree
planting programme for our children in order to teach our
youth the importance of our natural resources. We are
taking steps necessary to ensure that our forests and reefs
are available for future generations.
The Republic of Palau has incorporated the grave
issues of climate change and rises in sea level into long-
term strategic planning. Instruments for accession to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and the Kyoto Protocol are in transmission, and
we humbly request international assistance to develop a
comprehensive vulnerability index that encompasses
economic and environmental factors like climate change.
We enthusiastically support efforts to adjust energy
prices to accurately reflect the environmental
2


consequences of fossil fuel use. Alongside climate change,
energy conservation is critical to Palau's economy and the
environment. We have established a national policy, the
National Energy Goal, to subsidize renewable energy
programmes, and have audited all Government facilities for
energy efficiency. At our national hospital we replaced
standard incandescent lights with energy efficient compact
fluorescent lamps. Solar panels provide lights for our outer
islands and isolated villages. Solar beacons light our reef
channels. Our national energy programme and public utility
corporation are in partnership with the Million Solar
Rooftops initiative to educate the public about renewable
energy applications. Let us start off the new century with
a dynamic move away from fossil fuels and towards a
commitment to environment friendly energy alternatives.
Entering into relevant agreements and conventions
which target international response to environmental issues
is another responsibility that our Republic has to its people
and this world community. It is one that we are fulfilling as
time goes on, being a signatory and party to eight
international agreements, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The Republic of Palau views climate change as being
in the forefront of issues that need to be addressed, and that
can only be effectively addressed if all Member States
meaningfully contribute on the basis of common but
differentiated responsibilities. The use of the Kyoto
mechanisms is an integral component of a global solution
to the issue of climate change. Therefore, it is critical that
no artificial restrictions be placed on the use of these
mechanisms. If we can all come to terms with the intent of
the Kyoto mechanisms and develop a fair and realistic
approach to their use, there will be no sufficient reason why
we cannot enter the new millennium with positive remedies
to the issue of climate change. Maybe we can even enter
the new millennium with a breath of fresh air.
As we travel towards the new millennium, let us move
forward with the tools that we have developed as an
international family, so that the benefits, although they may
go unseen in our generation, may be fully appreciated by
our children and their children. These initiatives shall be
our imprint, our assurance of a healthier environment for
generations to come.









"
3715,60,2005,VUT,"I bring warm greetings
from the people of the Republic of Vanuatu.
At the outset, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on
your assumption of the presidency of the General
Assembly at its sixtieth session. I assure you of my
Government’s support for the work of the United
Nations under your stewardship. I take this opportunity
also to acknowledge, with deep admiration, the sterling
dedication of your predecessor, Mr. Jean Ping, who
meticulously steered the work of the fifty-ninth session
to its conclusion. I would like also to pay tribute to the
Secretary-General for his active role and for his
resilience in continuing the work of United Nations
reform.
We come to the Assembly annually to reaffirm
our faith and confidence in the purposes and principles
of the Charter. This year is especially important, since
leaders are meeting five years after the Millennium
Summit to take stock of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Although the outcome document has
been adopted, we are extremely disappointed with the
omission of numerous paragraphs. The farcical ending
of the negotiations resulted in a dilution of the quality
of the final document. The United Nations must, in
future, avoid becoming a rubber stamp for the
powerful.
The world is at a crossroads. Our meeting is
taking place at a critical juncture. Civil and political
strife, wars, poverty, diseases, famine, drought, natural
disasters, terrorism, minority oppression and
environmental degradation are affecting the lives of
millions of people. The sacrilege of such human
suffering is unbelievable and painful to bear.
The United Nations must be able to do more and
must respond more promptly to such situations. It must
do so by improving its preventive-capacity
mechanisms so as to minimize the devastating impact
on peoples’ livelihood and to ease their suffering.
We must ask, therefore, whether we are really
doing enough for our peoples. Is this all about
impressive speeches, rhetoric and pretentious,
grandiose plans that detract from the real issues that
need addressing? My Government is disillusioned by
the lack of genuine goodwill and support that is being
offered to the United Nations.
I would like to reiterate my Government’s
message to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth
session.
“The Achilles heel of the current structure is the
imbalance of power in the United Nations system.
It has become so chronic that it has weakened
2

the multilateral focus, cohesiveness and
internationalism of the United Nations.”
(A/59/PV.14, p. 25)
The principles of democratization and good
governance, so actively advocated and championed by
some Members, must be reflected in the reorganization
and decision-making process of the United Nations
system.
If we are to get back on track, the United Nations
must be rejuvenated. It must be reinvigorated so that it
can reassume its legitimate and central responsibility in
addressing the causes of conflict, maintaining peace
and security and promoting the development agenda.
But if it is to do that, the Organization’s decision-
making and other processes must be transparent and
truly democratized. Some of us preach strongly on
democracy the world over, yet are unable to practice
and enforce those values when it really matters. We are
now on the threshold of a new beginning, so let us not
allow this new opportunity to pass.
At the summit, I said that tolerance and respect
must form the nucleus for any reform of the United
Nations. Only by enforcing those values will we come
to realize the true meaning of justice, equality and
human rights. The diversity of the developing world
presents huge challenges for us all. However, the
strong nations must be able to muster the political will
to effect changes. The big players need to transform
their philosophy and their mindset, because they have
been hindrances to the creation of an equitable system
of good governance within multilateral organizations
such as the United Nations.
The United Nations remains indispensable for
future peace and prosperity. Globalization has brought
nations together; we are interlinked and
interdependent, and that requires global cooperation
and governance from all responsible Members of the
Organization. Understandably, there are vested
interests held by the powerful. That requires genuine
cooperation and goodwill, and those interests and the
role of the United Nations must converge in order to
ensure compatibility with the international legal
framework.
My Government fully supports efforts to reform
the United Nations system so as to ensure a stronger
and more effective Organization. In this context, my
delegation shares the views of other delegations on the
need to revise the membership of the Security Council
so as to ensure fair representation of Member States
without affecting the authority of the Council. A more
representative Council will bring openness and
transparency, create confidence and improve
understanding and cooperation. The restructuring of
the Security Council membership is long overdue.
Diversity is essential in that respect.
I agree that terrorism is one of three main
scourges confronting humankind today — the others
being poverty and disease. My Government condemns
those deliberate callous and inhuman acts that have
taken the lives of innocent people. There is no just act
of terrorism. We agree that we must work collectively
in eliminating that deadly menace from the face of the
Earth. But the fight against terrorism must be balanced
and targeted so as to ensure that resources are equitably
channelled into meeting the Millennium Development
Goals.
The global economic situation today
discriminates against many of the developing
economies. Unfair trading practices and the imposition
of intrusive policies on national economies affect our
economies by opening them up to unfavourable
conditions that only favour the stronger nations. Such
negative actions marginalize nations and peoples.
Marginalization then breeds and incites resentment,
fuelling the hatred that eventually creates fertile
grounds for extremism to grow and flourish.
We have agreed on the establishment of the
Peacebuilding Commission, which will also enable
more work to be done to combat the spread of
terrorism, in particular by identifying areas where
international support and understanding are required.
Although we are injecting many resources into curing
the problem, we are not really preventing it from
emerging. The world needs a spirit of pacifism if real
peace is to prevail. In order to achieve that, the United
Nations needs moral leadership — leadership that
focuses on security and dignity for the human person.
The post-Monterrey Conference era poses
extreme challenges for the economic survival and
socio-economic stability of many of the small island
developing nations like Vanuatu. We urge our
development partners to honour their commitments to
reach the 0.7 per cent target for official development
assistance (ODA). In this context we welcome the
commitments from the United States of America
through the Millennium Challenge Account. We also
3

welcome commitments by Qatar, the European Union
and the People’s Republic of China. Furthermore, we
look forward to the coming to fruition of initiatives by
France and other countries.
The pivotal role of trade as the engine for
economic growth cannot be overemphasized, but, as
many of my colleagues from the small island States
and the least developed countries have stated, market
access and special preferential treatment must be
provided.
Furthermore, many of us are restricted by
inflexible and immoral conditions that inhibit new
financing and development initiatives. We continue to
call for trade and investment and labour export to help
our economies to grow.
My Government’s national development priorities
focus on building the productive sector. The
Government’s prioritized action agenda highlights the
policy areas that we believe to be essential in meeting
our development objectives. It is the catalyst for
Vanuatu’s medium- to long-term strategic planning,
which emphasizes the need to empower our rural
population through infrastructure- and capacity-
building initiatives. The development policy
framework is consistent with achieving the MDG
targets, and the development strategy is being refined
to give equal consideration to our other international
commitments and the Pacific Plan. We appeal to our
development partners to assist us in the effective
implementation of our strategy.
A fundamental lesson to be drawn from Vanuatu’s
reforms is that they have been forced from outside,
without being adapted to our national circumstances.
From Vanuatu’s perspective, externally driven reforms
must be buttressed by an equal partnership that
respects local traditions and cultures and the rights of
all citizens, without disturbing the essential uniting
mechanisms of society that have successfully held us
together. Vanuatu embraces democracy and the
concepts of good governance and transparency, but
those far-reaching principles must be tailored to
traditional systems without affecting their relevance
and significance.
With regard to the environment, we urge our
development partners to actively support the effective
implementation of the Mauritius Strategy. The
challenges confronting island States are ominous, and I
repeat the call that more recognition should be given to
accommodate our natural characteristics and
vulnerabilities. We also urge States that have not yet
done so to act responsibly by ratifying the Kyoto
Protocol as soon as possible.
On the question of the shipment of radioactive
materials and hazardous waste, improvements in
safeguards and assurances should not have to await a
calamity. Preventive measures must be the course of
action to take. The risks posed by the forces of nature,
coupled with increased terrorist activities, are too
grave for enhanced safeguards to deal with. The world
would be better off banning such shipments rather than
endlessly trying to perfect safeguards approaches that,
at best, only limit such serious risks. Complacency
would be our greatest mistake.
The Charter of the United Nations espouses the
principles that continue to guide the Organization’s
efforts in the process of self-determination. That right
must be progressively advanced. The United Nations
must be consistent and not lose sight of the
fundamental right of self-determination for those who
are working their way out of the shackles of colonial
rule. Ruling and sovereign authorities must ensure that
the process remains on track.
Where the United Nations has failed to fully
comply with the appropriate legal procedures, it is only
proper that such instances be adequately addressed to
allow justice to prevail for the victims. Circumventing
the issue only exposes the dark history and raises
serious questions about the credibility, relevance and
integrity of the United Nations. Only in an open and
consistent manner can we redress past failures and
provide a stronger basis for the advancement of United
Nations ideals.
Such contradictions simply make a mockery of
the fundamental principles of human rights and self-
determination clearly enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations. How can we call for respect for human
rights, yet blatantly ignore the pleas of the millions
calling out for justice? The United Nations cannot, and
must not, continue to turn a blind eye to its own past
failures. It is morally, politically and legally wrong to
do so.
The continuing disputes raised over the
implementation of United Nations resolutions are clear
4

examples challenging the integrity and validity of the
United Nations. We cannot ignore the calls of the West
Papuans in their quest for justice. We urge the United
Nations to act responsibly in revisiting the case of West
Papua. However, we are encouraged by the Indonesian
Government’s efforts to address alleged human rights
abuses. We also welcome decisions empowering West
Papuans to manage their own affairs in collaboration
with the central Government.
The United Nations must also explore various
avenues to end the economic embargo imposed on
Cuba. Countless resolutions have been adopted to no
effect, and the Cuban people continue to be
marginalized in the multilateral trading system. This is
a critically challenging responsibility. Some may see it
as an improbable task, but it must be addressed with
genuine support and goodwill on the part of the
relevant authorities and sovereign States.
In conclusion, I hope that the Creator’s wisdom
will prevail as we continue our journey. Despite all our
differences and diversities, human security for all is
our main goal and should remain the focus of the
United Nations agenda. The cardinal question is, will
Members allow the United Nations to undertake
serious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead? And
will the Organization be capable of guaranteeing a
future of peace and prosperity that is not reserved only
for the big players but will be enjoyed by all? Will the
United Nations become a juggernaut for the stronger
nations? A famous biblical verse reminds us about the
fundamental wisdom of building on rock instead of
sand. The future remains in our hands, and the
Republic of Vanuatu will play its part.
May our beloved almighty Creator bless us all."
3722,60,2005,MHL,"I wish to extend
warm greetings of iokwe from the people of the
Marshall Islands as we gather for the sixtieth session of
the Assembly. I am honoured to speak on behalf of
President Kessai H. Note, who had to leave New York
ahead of schedule due to an urgent matter at home.
Sixty years have passed since a visionary course
of action was charted recognizing that freedom, justice
and peace in the world are based on the inherent
dignity, equality and inalienable rights of all. The
world has felt the direct impact of the United Nations,
and we have good reason to be grateful. Critics
notwithstanding, our Organization has served the
global community and has touched every aspect of our
lives.
The Marshall Islands is grateful for the United
Nations, for without it, how could a small remote
island nation express its concerns, be heard, and be on
common ground with the rich and powerful?
Five years after we made a unanimous
commitment to peace, liberty and sustainable
development, we have gathered here again to take
concrete measures. We approved last Friday an
instrument that the Secretariat and the General
Assembly can build upon in streamlining the United
Nations and in meeting the many new challenges of the
twenty-first century.
All aspects of life in the Marshall Islands have
been profoundly affected by its extraordinary history,
which encompasses a Pacific war and the legacy of
nuclear testing. Its remoteness, size and vulnerability
continue to limit opportunities for the economic growth
of the Marshall Islands. In finding ways to work
together for the betterment of the population,
traditional leaders and representatives of our national
and local governments, non-governmental
organizations, and private and public sectors convened
last month in a special retreat - an opportunity for
everyone involved to build trust and to think and work
together in crafting a shared vision that can and will
ensure the prosperity of the people. We continue to
move beyond words to action.
We continue also to engage actively in regional
activities in the Pacific, including through our regional
organizations, such as the Pacific Islands Forum. A
great deal of work has been done in the development of
the Pacific Plan, a strategy for broader regional
cooperation based on the key goals of economic
growth, sustainable development, good governance and
security. The Plan will be presented to Forum leaders
when they meet next month. It will also be discussed at
our small island States meeting, which the Marshall
Islands chairs.
In the international arena, we continue to reaffirm
our solidarity with the Alliance of Small Island States.
We are grateful for the support of the General
Assembly in its endorsement of the Declaration and
Strategy for the Further Implementation of the
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development
of Small Island Developing States, adopted at the
Mauritius International Meeting last January. The
Strategy requires quick and practical action to address
the unique challenges facing the sustainable
development of small island developing States.
The Marshall Islandsí small resource base,
limited market access, fragile environment,
vulnerability to climate change and variability, as well
25

as the high costs of energy, along with issues related to
infrastructure, transportation and communications, are
among the many constraints we face within the existing
international economic environment. Our vulnerability
to environmental and economic events continues to
impede our opportunities for development.
Our development efforts will be in vain if the
results are reversed by continued degradation of the
environment and depletion of natural resources.
We are pleased that the Kyoto Protocol has now
entered into force. However, some major emitters
remain outside of it. A more inclusive international
framework needs to be developed for stabilizing
greenhouse-gas emissions beyond 2012, with broader
participation by all major emitters - developed and
developing countries.
Climate change is a serious and long-term
challenge that has the potential to affect every part of
the world. It is time to undertake concrete actions and
measures at all levels. In that context, we welcome the
progress made in terms of the establishment and
development of an all-hazard early warning system.
United Nations international efforts were very
swift and effective in the wake of the devastating
tsunami in the Indian Ocean and, more recently,
following Hurricane Katrina in the southern United
States. We hope that the international community will
not act so humanely only in the aftermath of natural
disasters but also in the context of the far less dramatic,
but no less crucial global actions needed to mitigate
climate change and arrest sea-level rise before it is too
late to act and the people of the Marshall Islands and
others become environmental refugees.
On health issues, the Marshall Islands continues
to face the challenges associated in dealing with major
diseases such as diabetes, influenza, bird flu, SARS
and the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and other
sexually transmitted diseases. Despite the difficulties
we face in addressing these challenges, we are proud
of, and grateful for, the involvement of the traditional
leadership, which has contributed to the substantial
progress made at the local and national levels.
We are in the final stages of completing the
HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan. Our ambition to
carry out this task is strong, but we cannot do it alone.
The support of the international community is
extremely important to help build our capacity; to
strengthen our human resources; to help us implement
effective public education programmes that will
encourage behavioural change among the high-risk
groups in our population; and to provide technical
assistance to facilitate prompt access to the Global
Fund and other financial sources to combat HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, diabetes and malaria.
We have integrated family planning and maternal
and child health programmes into reproductive health
services, and we fully support the initiatives on
accessibility to reproductive health services under the
Millennium Development Goals.
On sustainable development, the Marshall Islands
has established a task force to ensure that the
Millennium Development Goals are fully integrated
into our national strategy. One challenge we continue
to face is the need for human and technical resources,
but, despite that and other challenges, we are
determined to work towards achieving the Goals.
During this, the first policy year of its first
implementation cycle, we recognize the important
precedent set by the thirteenth session of the
Commission on Sustainable Development as to how
future cycles could be conducted and what type of
outcomes could be expected. The Marshall Islands is
working hard to improve access to freshwater, develop
environmentally responsible waste management
systems and provide affordable and renewable energy
sources. Our programme would be impossible without
the continued support of the international community
and development partners, for which we are always
grateful.
One issue that continues to haunt the people of
the Marshall Islands is the effects of nuclear weapons
testing. When people in most parts of the world talk
about nuclear devastation, they tend to think of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, few are aware that
the Marshall Islands experienced the equivalent of 1.6
Hiroshima-sized bombs every day during the 12 years
that numerous nuclear weapons were detonated and
tested in our country. Interestingly, this took place
while the Marshall Islands was part of the United
Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
We would like to emphasize the need for full
resolution of this issue based on the changed
circumstances that have come to light and the new
information gathered from recent scientific and
medical studies on radiological safety, clean-up and the
26

malignant effects of radiation on health. I call on the
international community to support the Marshall
Islands in this endeavour.
The Marshall Islands has experienced the far-
reaching and invasive effects of a nuclear testing
programme on the most intimate and personal levels:
from home islands no longer inhabitable to the illness
and death of many of our friends and families. We can
prepare our health system to deal with this burden, but
we can never remedy the human and emotional toll that
this has had and continues to have on us as individuals,
families, communities and as a nation.
Concerning disarmament and non-proliferation,
we believe that sustainable peace and development will
not be achieved without major steps towards
disarmament. Reiterating our firm commitment to the
Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
we look forward to strengthening its implementation,
including through future review conferences.
As a nation whose single most important
productive sector and key export are its fisheries, the
state of the worldís oceans and fish stocks and how
these vital resources are being exploited remain our
utmost concern. We recognize the importance of the
Convention on the Conservation and Management of
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and
Central Pacific Ocean. We remain seriously concerned
about instances of illegal, unreported and unregulated
fishing within our exclusive economic zone. The
continued assistance of the international community is
needed in building capacity for monitoring and
surveillance in this regard.
The global threat the world faces today is a
challenge of a different nature from anything we have
had to deal with before. We recognize how poverty,
environmental degradation and the abuse of human
rights undermine human security. We welcome the
recent adoption of the International Convention for the
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We continue
to cooperate closely within the Pacific region to ensure
that effective regional action is taken to combat threats
to our peace and security. We have taken steps to
combat money-laundering and the financing of
terrorism and to implement the twelve core anti-
terrorism conventions and relevant Security Council
resolutions. In our global effort to counter terrorism,
agreeing on the definition of terrorism is one of the
many issues that requires serious consideration and
resolution.
Concerning the Middle East peace process, we
commend the determination and strong resolve of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in his effort to
reinvigorate the Middle East peace process by fulfilling
Israelís pledge to withdraw from the Gaza Strip.
Concerning the International Criminal Court, we
welcome its progress in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Uganda and Darfur situations. We are also
pleased with the entry into force of the agreement
between the International Criminal Court and the
United Nations. We continue to call on all States to
strengthen the rule of law around the world by ratifying
the Rome Statute governing that Court.
Bearing in mind the phrase 'we the peoples' in
the Preamble to the Charter, Marshall Islands believes
that if the United Nations adheres to the principles of
universality and self-determination, it must not exclude
the 23 million people of the free, democratic and
independent nation of Taiwan. As a free and
prosperous country, Taiwan has much to contribute to
the peace and security of the Western Pacific, and we
reiterate our full support for the ongoing quest of the
people of Taiwan to be granted membership in this
family of nations. Denying membership to a free and
democratic nation and condoning the presence of
repressive States is a flagrant violation of basic
democratic principles.
In a world divided by chasms between the rich
and the poor, between the powerful and the powerless,
differences of interest are certain to shape all our
reform efforts and perpetuate a contradictory and
divided Organization. We share the aspirations of a
United Nations guided by the following values and
principles: belief in multilateral cooperation, the
imperative of prevention, respect for the rule of law
and human rights, solidarity with the poor and
suffering, concern for the rights of women and the
children of the world and their future, and for the
health of Planet Earth.
We reiterate our support for reform and expansion
of the Security Council, using a criteria-based
approach based on factors such as economic size,
population, commitment to democracy and human
rights, financial contribution to the United Nations,
contributions to peacekeeping and record on counter-
terrorism and non-proliferation.
27

The Marshall Islands will continue to participate
in this sessionís important debates on how to reform
and strengthen the United Nations as an institution and
how to ensure that it effectively addresses the threats
and challenges of the twenty-first century. We assure
you of our full cooperation towards the goal of a
strong, effective and accountable Organization."
3727,60,2005,NRU,"The outcome document 
adopted at the High-level Plenary Meeting (resolution 
60/1) serves as a map by which we navigate in seeking 
to improve the lives of the many peoples of the world; 
it may be imperfect, but it is our task as leaders to 
provide a vision of a better world and to lead our 
peoples towards the achievement of that vision. The 
outcome document spells out this vision, and we 
should use it much as one uses a map when navigating 
the destiny of our respective nations.  
 In this respect, Nauru looks to the United Nations 
as the global leader in reaching this vision of a better 
world: a world in which human rights are collectively 
recognized and defended, terrorism in any form is 
eliminated, peace and security is promoted and 
maintained, and poverty is eradicated. We therefore 
applaud the effort to strengthen the work of the United 
Nations through management reform. This should 
improve the delivery of the global services that this 
Organization is expected to provide. 
 Equally important is the need to reform the 
Security Council, to recognize that international 
developments since the establishment of that body 
many decades ago now demand a more democratic 
representation of the global family in an expanded 
Security Council. The earlier these reforms are 
implemented, the earlier the work of the United 
  
 
4 05-51226 
 
Nations can be further improved, with commensurate 
benefit to the people whose interests we all serve. 
 Nauru is in the unenviable position of having lost 
its earlier status as a donor country, with much of its 
wealth lost through mismanagement and, in particular, 
corrupt leadership. We therefore speak with some 
experience when we note with encouragement the 
decision by the United Nations to implement 
management and structural reforms to improve, 
amongst other things, transparency and accountability 
for the greater good of Member countries and the 
peoples we represent.  
 Nauru itself is undertaking significant economic 
and political reforms as it recommences the nation-
building process. These include the design of a national 
development strategy, the public consultative phase of 
which has just been concluded; it will be presented to 
the donor community in November this year. We hope 
that the international community can participate, not by 
driving the development agenda for the people of 
Nauru, but by accepting the vision of our people as that 
to be implemented by Nauru with the support of its 
development partners. The development agenda for 
developing countries, particularly those with fragile 
and vulnerable economies, must be designed by those 
on whose lives that agenda will have an impact and not 
by external parties that have a different agenda. 
 We believe that the thorough consultative process 
within which the national development strategy is 
being designed is in itself an exercise in democracy. 
The views expressed by government and non-
government agencies and by community, faith and 
other leaders, is testament to the strength of democracy 
in Nauru. To turn a blind eye to this process by driving 
a development agenda not envisioned by the people is 
not only dangerous to the development needs of the 
people it should serve, but a threat to democracy itself. 
We hope that the United Nations itself will have a 
leading role in assisting the rebuilding of Nauru and in 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 
We reiterate our call for a United Nations presence in 
Nauru for this purpose. 
 Nauru also calls upon the developed world to 
match its rhetoric with action when it comes to meeting 
the development needs of the developing world, 
through development financing and/or debt relief. It is 
simply not good enough to be targeting the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 
2015 without making available the resources to fund 
that effort. The developed world has an obligation to 
share its resources with the developing world by 
ensuring it meets its own target of official development 
assistance expenditure of 0.7 per cent of gross 
domestic product, and to achieve it promptly, if the 
developing world is to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals within 10 years. 
 The decision not to consider the question of the 
people of Taiwan is a gross dereliction of duty by this 
Assembly. There are 23 million people on Taiwan who 
are being denied the right to be recognized and 
protected by this Organization. The United Nations has 
a role in assisting and facilitating constructive dialogue 
to ensure a future of peace for the people of Taiwan 
and the rest of that region. Peace and security in the 
Taiwan Strait is peace and security in the Asia-Pacific 
region. I am very hopeful that Member States will 
recognize and accept the appeal by the good people of 
Taiwan at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.  
 God bless the Republic of Nauru and God bless 
the United Nations and the peoples of the world. We 
shall proceed with God’s will first. "
3731,60,2005,AUS,"Australia is a founding
Member of the United Nations, and we have long
supported this Organization’s important role in world
affairs. The United Nations has many achievements to
celebrate in its sixtieth year. Equally, the sixtieth
anniversary places the shortcomings and indeed the
failings of the United Nations under a microscope for
all to see.
In approaching this occasion, the United Nations
and its Members have been presented with a challenge:
to find practical and workable ways to bring greater
security and prosperity to the people of the world
through a reformed United Nations system. This has
not been easy. The reform agenda is simultaneously
vast and urgent, with agreement on approaches
difficult — at times impossible — to achieve, as the
recent summit process made clear.
Australia welcomes the summit’s progress in
some important areas, particularly the agreement to
establish a Peacebuilding Commission to assist fragile
States, a field of endeavour where Australia has long
been active in its own region, as I have outlined in
previous addresses to the General Assembly. We also
welcome the fact that States have agreed for the first
time that the international community, through the
United Nations, has the responsibility to act to protect
populations from gross and systematic violations of
human rights.
We also welcome the call for early conclusion of
a comprehensive terrorism convention and early entry
into force of the International Convention for the
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.
We are pleased that, on development, the Summit
Outcome (resolution 60/1) recognizes what already
underpins Australia’s approach to development
assistance: that good governance, sound economic
policies, anti-corruption measures and trade
liberalization are critical elements in fighting poverty
and promoting economies and stable communities.
Australia has a proud record of assistance in these
areas, further underscored by our announcement last
week of an increase in Australia’s overseas aid
allocation to about 4 billion Australian dollars by
2010 — a doubling of aid from 2004 levels — as well
as generous contributions of 10 million Australian
dollars to the Democracy Fund and 3 million to the
Peacebuilding Fund over three years.
As a nation that strongly supports an ambitious
outcome of the Doha round of multilateral trade
negotiations and recognizes the crucial importance of
this to developing countries, Australia also welcomes
the pledge and challenge put forward by President
Bush a week ago (see A/60/PV.2): that the United
States is ready to eliminate all tariffs, subsidies and
other barriers if other nations do the same.
But alongside these welcome outcomes, many
questions and, in some cases, vast disappointments
remain. On arms control and non-proliferation, we
have absolutely nothing to show — an extraordinarily
poor outcome given a contemporary global security
environment in which proliferation threats are so
clearly evident.
The outdated ideology that too many delegations
brought to negotiations was a damningly deep
reflection on the intergovernmental process at the
United Nations. We did not grasp the opportunity
provided by the largest-ever gathering of world leaders
to produce a political declaration defining acts of
terrorism.
How can some nations continue to assert that the
deliberate maiming and targeting of civilians is
sometimes justified?
How is it — after atrocities in Sharm el-Sheikh,
Istanbul, Jakarta, Riyadh and on a daily basis in Iraq —
that some continue to employ double standards,
deceiving themselves into believing that such terrorists
could ever be considered to be “freedom fighters”?
This is not an argument about the merits of a
particular cause. It is about the moral imperative to
outlaw behaviour that offends civilization.
We were disappointed that the summit missed the
opportunity to make progress on Security Council
reform to ensure that the Council’s membership and
5

functioning match the priorities and the realities of this
century.
While the summit resolved to create a Human
Rights Council, the outcome document is
disappointingly short on detail. A new Human Rights
Council must overcome the credibility deficit that
plagues current human rights machinery and that sees
some of the most egregious human rights abusers
elevated to positions of leadership.
Australia will participate constructively in
negotiations on the shape of this new Council. We will
also more than double — to $650,000 — our
contribution to the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights.
Finally, the management reforms agreed at the
summit are a step in the right direction, but they are
just that — one step.
The Secretary-General needs more authority and
flexibility to manage the United Nations. And — as
recent inquiries have highlighted in sobering detail —
the United Nations accountability, audit and oversight
systems must be massively strengthened. It will not be
easy, but we must address anew our failures.
The summit heralded an historic shift in our
thinking on humanitarian intervention, showing a
willingness to embrace a new mindset, one which
addresses our responsibility to watch out for each other
in times of need — our collective “responsibility to
protect”. Too often the world has stood by watching
humanitarian disasters unfold before international
machinery has creaked into action.
In Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo, action
taken was too little, too late. Today, the situation in
Darfur epitomizes those shortcomings.
As the Summit Outcome makes clear, all States
have a responsibility to protect their own population
from egregious crimes such as genocide and crimes
against humanity. Where a population is suffering
serious harm, and the relevant State is unwilling or
unable to stop this, the principle of non-intervention
should yield to the collective responsibility to protect.
The Security Council must now rely on this new
consensus to respond more effectively to humanitarian
crises.
We have a responsibility to react faster to
situations of compelling human need, and we must do
more to help countries rebuild, recover and reconcile
after conflicts or disasters.
In the last year we have seen the people of
Afghanistan and Iraq exercise restored democratic
rights. The international community must continue
support for their transformations, help them to leave
behind the experience of brutal dictators and narrow
regimes, and ensure that progress and democracy take
root.
Ceding any ground in Iraq or Afghanistan to the
tyranny of terrorism and the violent suffering it brings
would be a backward step in our global campaign, a
campaign we continue to fight but have not yet won, as
the July terrorist attacks in London and the ongoing
terrorist menace in South-East Asia and elsewhere
make clear. There remains an urgent need for nations to
come together to confront terrorists in the battle of
ideas, contest extremist ideologies, and build greater
and more productive dialogue between faiths and
civilizations.
Australia is doing its utmost in our region to
tackle terrorism and the ideology that feeds it. United
Nations machinery must also play a part. Many
Member States still need assistance to implement
United Nations counter-terrorism standards and build
their counter-terrorism capabilities — the kind of
outcomes Australia is already pursuing in cooperation
with its regional partners. Leaders made some progress
in this direction last week but did not adopt the
Secretary-General’s counter-terrorism strategy.
Australia welcomed the General Assembly’s
adoption of the International Convention for the
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in April this
year. Our Prime Minister, John Howard, signed that
Convention for Australia at the summit. It is now
imperative that we redouble our efforts to conclude a
comprehensive convention against terrorism during
this session of the General Assembly. Closing the gaps
in the counter-terrorism legal framework is an essential
complement to our concerted efforts to prevent future
attacks and to prosecute those who commit terrorist
acts. Effective international efforts to criminalize such
acts are a vital step forward.
The world today is confronted by a menace not
envisaged at the time the Geneva Conventions were
drafted — terrorist organizations and their foot
soldiers, like those captured in Afghanistan, who bear
arms on a battlefield but pay no heed to the laws of
6

war, fight for no regular army, wear no uniform and
bear no recognizable insignia. Just as international law
evolved to deal with a scourge of another age —
piracy — so today a comprehensive convention against
terrorism is needed to help deal with these perpetrators
of terrorist acts.
The summit was a lost opportunity on
disarmament and non-proliferation. Multilateral non-
proliferation regimes are being tested now by a small
minority of Governments that flout the norms and
standards observed by the rest of the international
community and which in doing so imperil the security
of us all.
A dangerous new dimension to this global
challenge is the known ambition of terrorists to acquire
weapons of mass destruction. It is therefore imperative
that we take practical action against proliferation as it
occurs, through innovative measures such as the
Proliferation Security Initiative that complement and
reinforce multilateral regimes.
Earlier this year I saw firsthand the Review
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons be thwarted by
a few countries determined to prevent consensus.
Australia — together with the overwhelming
majority of States — remains unwavering in its support
for the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we will continue
to take a leading role in universalizing the Additional
Protocol on strengthening nuclear safeguards, making
it a precondition for the supply of uranium to non-
nuclear-weapon States.
It is not acceptable, in the current global climate,
that we have not started negotiations on a fissile
material cut-off treaty, a treaty which would reduce the
risk of leakage of fissile material to proliferators or
terrorists and would buttress nuclear disarmament
gains made to date.
I am pleased to be chairing the Comprehensive
Test-Ban Treaty Article XIV Conference this
afternoon, looking for ways to accelerate that Treaty’s
entry into force.
A firmer and more active Security Council role
on the issue of weapons of mass destruction is also
sorely needed.
Australia is a committed and long-term supporter
of the United Nations and of the vital role that it can
play in promoting international peace and security. We
have a proud record of contributing to United Nations
activities, funding and debates, extending back to its
formation in 1945.
But we are not an uncritical supporter. The need
to reform the United Nations has been a consistent
theme since I first addressed the General Assembly at
its fifty-first session in 1996. Such a need is all the
more compelling today.
The reality is that there continue to be States
failing or in precipitous decline for no reasons other
than poor leadership and poor governance — with
disastrous results for human lives. What does it say
when the international community proves to be
unwilling to act when misrule has caused life
expectancy to plunge in what was one of Africa’s most
promising countries — from around 63 years in the
early 1990s, to just under 34 years in 2004? Would
today’s United Nations be able to prevent another
Rwanda?
We and the publics of the world expect much of
the United Nations, and rightly so. The stakes are too
high in this complex and challenging security
environment to accept anything less. We all have a part
to play. There was some welcome progress at the
summit; but where we have fallen short we must
acknowledge it and be ambitious in pursuing more
meaningful reform. Large challenges loom before us.
We should approach them with a degree of realism.
Australia does not believe that the United Nations is
the answer to all the problems of the world. But the
Organization does have a role to play. When we call on
the United Nations, it must be able to fulfil that role
effectively and expeditiously. The publics of the world
expect nothing less."
3741,60,2005,KIR,"Please accept my
congratulations, Sir, on your election to the presidency,
and my assurances that Kiribati will support you during
your term of office. I would also like to take this
opportunity to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Jean
Ping, for his able and effective leadership during the
fifty-ninth session.
During last week's High-level Plenary Meeting,
we discussed, among other issues, the future of this
Organization and what we expect from it. We heard about
the achievements made by our Organization over the past
60 years. We express our gratitude to all nations for the
cooperation and support that led to those achievements.
I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General as
well as his staff, for his leadership of our Organization
at these difficult and trying times.
We also heard about the shortcomings of our
Organization. While we recognize and fully endorse
the need for reform in the Organization, we are
concerned that many of the shortcomings in terms of
the promotion of sustainable development in Member
nations, in particular in the small island developing
States, are the result of our inability to deliver on
commitments made in the past.
Individual Member nations have the prime
responsibility for achieving sustainable development
within their borders, but with globalization and the
increasing interdependency of our world, individual
nations cannot achieve sustainable development acting
alone. To attain sustainable development in small
island developing States, the need for external
cooperation and support is understandably more
pronounced.
Having taken stock of progress over the past 60
years, the challenge now is to consider measures by
which we can collectively and through the United
Nations address the needs and concerns highlighted
during the High-level Plenary Meeting. Of particular
concern are the special needs of the least developed
countries and small island developing States.
While Kiribati may be categorized as a least
developed country and a small island developing State,
the people of Kiribati have a genuine desire to develop
themselves and at the same time to develop their
country. As their elected representatives, we have a
clear mandate and duty to make our best efforts to meet
their development aspirations.
2

Population issues are a major challenge in our
development efforts. Concerted efforts to promote
effective family planning have been given greater
focus in our national development strategies. The
growing number of unemployed youth brings with it
new social issues. We are committed to directing the
energy of our youth to productive and worthwhile
pursuits. Employment opportunities abroad for both
men and women, such as the arrangements in place
with foreign shipping companies, fishing companies
and cruise operators, will be expanded and new
opportunities explored. The New Zealand Government's
Pacific Access Category scheme is a very welcome
model that merits closer scrutiny by other countries.
The spiralling cost of fuel is an issue of grave
concern to us. The impact of rising fuel costs has been
hardest on the least developed countries, which are also
the least able to afford it. Therefore, the need to
accelerate the development of alternative sources of
energy, including clean and renewable energy, is now
greater than it ever was.
We firmly believe that our fishery resources can
provide us with the basis for achieving a sustainable
future, but in order to be able to do so, we shall need
the assistance of our development partners in providing
the necessary incentives through the provision of credit
schemes to those investors who are able and willing to
develop onshore facilities within resource-owning
countries.
But before we can achieve that, and if we are to
achieve our Millennium Development Goals, we shall
continue to be reliant on the official development
assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national
income being met.
Environmental issues and, in particular, climate
change and sea-level rise are security issues for
countries comprising low-lying coral atolls, such as
Kiribati. A global and concerted effort, including
stronger political commitment, is required to achieve
the objectives of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change.
We are appreciative of the support we have
received and continue to receive in developing
adaptation measures to climate change and sea-level
rise. We nevertheless acknowledge the need now to
seriously consider the option of having to relocate our
peoples when necessary — an option that can be
meaningfully addressed only within this forum.
Kiribati fully endorses the need for
comprehensive reform in the United Nations. The
environment in which the Organization now operates is
so very different from that of 1945. Reform must take
place to ensure that the Organization continues to be a
relevant institution for its Member countries.
Terrorism threatens all. Kiribati condemns
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and we
support the global fight against terrorism. We have
noted with increasing alarm the globalization of terror.
We cannot afford to be complacent about terrorism and
will contribute, within our resource constraints, to the
war against terror. We seek support from those able and
willing in the implementation and enforcement of
counter-terrorism legislation we have passed in
compliance with our obligations as a member of the
global community.
Kiribati has contributed to the Regional
Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. We will
continue to contribute to that regional effort as long as
there is need. Kiribati is also interested in contributing
civilian police to peacekeeping missions of the United
Nations.
Kiribati supports an expansion of the permanent
and non-permanent membership of the Security Council.
In our view, those countries, such as Japan, that are
significant contributors to United Nations programmes
promoting peace, security and development merit a
permanent seat on the Security Council.
As we consider reform of the United Nations and
as we celebrate 60 years of the United Nations, we
believe that now is also the time to consider the issue
of Taiwan and its 23 million people. Taiwan is a
country where democracy thrives, where the rule of
law prevails and where human rights are respected.
Taiwan has also remained able and willing to make
significant contributions to the collaborative efforts to
secure global peace, security and prosperity.
We also believe that, whatever the views are on
the question of whether Taiwan is a domestic issue or
not, there can be no justification for supporting
threatening initiatives, such as the so called anti-
secession law, which could have such far-reaching
effects on regional and global stability.
I am confident that, under your leadership, Sir,
we will work with unity of purpose and perhaps with
less posturing to address the challenges before us."
3749,60,2005,PNG,"I
bring greetings and congratulations to the President of
the General Assembly from the Government and the
people of Papua New Guinea on the occasion of the
sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. I pledge my
delegation’s support in the discharge of his noble
responsibilities. I would like to commend again His
Excellency Mr. Jean Ping, Foreign Minister of Gabon,
for his stewardship of the work of the fifty-ninth
session of the General Assembly. I also pay tribute to
the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his staff
for their continued efforts in servicing the needs of
Member States.
At the outset, I would like to convey the heartfelt
sympathy and condolences of the people of Papua New
Guinea to the Government of the United States of
America and its people with respect to the loss of lives
and the destruction of property in the Gulf states. We
wish them well for a speedy recovery and in their
reconstruction efforts.
The United Nations has come a long way since its
inception in 1945. The focus on international peace and
security remains relevant, although since then it has
taken on new and different dimensions, including the
evil of global terrorism.
The process of reform of the United Nations,
particularly the General Assembly, the Security
Council and the Secretariat must be reflective of the
changing landscape of today’s international realities.
The membership of the Security Council, both
permanent and non-permanent, must be expanded to
include equitable representation from developing
countries. Work on the reform agenda, as set out in the
outcome document (resolution 60/1) of the High-level
Plenary Meeting, must commence without any further
delay. We strongly support the early resolution of all
the outstanding issues, including those related to
human rights and to disarmament.
Convening the recently concluded summit
enabled us to see how much progress we have made in
the implementation of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) in our respective countries. Despite the
Government’s efforts to achieve the MDGs, Papua
New Guinea’s scorecard indicates that much more
needs to be done. We recognize that combating
poverty, HIV/AIDS, child and maternal mortality and
unemployment and promoting universal primary
education and gender equality are major challenges for
Papua New Guinea.
Important legislative, policy and administrative
instruments are now being put in place. The
Millennium Development Goals and targets have been
incorporated into our medium-term development
strategy, which ties the MDGs to our development
programmes through the national budgetary process. I
am happy to report that in July of this year the Papua
New Guinea National Parliament endorsed a
comprehensive national MDG report, compiled with
the kind assistance of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). This now paves the way for
concrete efforts at all levels of Government and by all
relevant stakeholders to implement its
recommendations.
We are extremely concerned about the spread of
HIV/AIDS in our country. Papua New Guinea has the
highest incidence of reported cases in the Pacific
region. Important national legislation and policies have
been put in place to address all aspects of that scourge.
These include placing the National AIDS Council
directly under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s
department. Papua New Guinea therefore fully
supports the efforts of the United Nations and the
international community to address that scourge. We
support in particular the leadership of the Secretary-
General in mobilizing international resources for the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
and to combat other diseases.
Our development partners, including Australia,
New Zealand, UNDP, the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other United
Nations agencies, continue to support Papua New
Guinea’s efforts to address this critical issue. While we
appreciate such valuable assistance, it must be
coordinated effectively within the medium-term
development strategy policy framework if it is to have
maximum impact.
30

International finance, especially foreign direct
investment and overseas development assistance, are
vital instruments that can help developing countries
such as mine to achieve the MDGs and other
international commitments and obligations. Our
Government is therefore committed to attracting
foreign direct investment to assist us with development
efforts in our country. At the same time, overseas
development assistance must be used effectively, as
measured against achievement of the national
development goals and priorities set out in the
medium-term development strategy.
While Papua New Guinea has a good debt-
servicing record, debt repayments still place
considerable strain on our ability to provide much-
needed services to our people. They affect the
country’s ability to implement the MDGs, the outcome
of the World Summit on Social Development and other
important development commitments.
Papua New Guinea commends the European
Union’s assistance to help highly indebted poor
countries (HIPC) with their debt servicing difficulties.
Consideration, however, must also be given to other
non-HIPC countries, such as mine, so that they can
benefit from such goodwill and assistance. In this
context, we support the proposal by President
Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines to extend debt
servicing assistance to highly indebted non-HIPC
developing countries, including Papua New Guinea,
under a debt-for-equity swap arrangement.
Trade is the engine of economic growth and
development. It is a critical prerequisite for sustained
efforts to achieve socio-economic development,
including the MDGs. Papua New Guinea was
heartened to hear some leaders of major developed and
developing countries at the summit indicating firm
commitments to address the current distortions on
international trade regarding the elimination of
agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers. That is a
positive signal of a move towards the creation of an
open, equitable and rule-based international trading
system.
The ongoing Doha round of negotiations, as well
as the economic partnership agreement negotiations
between the European Union and the African,
Caribbean and Pacific countries must place greater
emphasis on development. The particular development
needs of small island developing States — the result of
their physical and structural disadvantages — must
also be given priority in the negotiating process.
As a young democracy, Papua New Guinea is
committed to fighting corruption and upholding the
principles of good governance and the rule of law.
Corruption, in particular, is the main impediment to
progress and development in developing countries such
as Papua New Guinea. The victims of corruption are
the poor, who are deprived of basic goods and services.
That is a great challenge for us, and we are determined
to combat it. Taking a step forward, Papua New Guinea
has ratified the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption. Other policies and administrative and
legislative measures have been put in place, along with
existing constitutional provisions on the leadership
code governing the conduct of leaders.
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons
is a also a major threat to the peace and security of our
country. Small arms and light weapons almost
destroyed our country. The Bougainville crisis was
fuelled by large quantities of small arms and light
weapons. Papua New Guinea will seek the cooperation
and support of neighbouring countries to put an end to
the traffic in small arms and light weapons to the
region. We therefore support the ongoing work at the
United Nations to address that critical issue.
The resolution of the Bougainville crisis was a
success story for the United Nations in the history of
peacekeeping efforts throughout the world. We thank
the United Nations — especially the Security Council
and the Secretary-General — and our friends in the
Pacific region, including Australia, New Zealand, Fiji,
Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Tonga, for assisting us
in concluding the peace process. Peace and normalcy
are now being consolidated, with the election of the
first Autonomous Government by the people of
Bougainville. They must be strengthened through
social and economic development throughout the
island. Basic goods and services are being restored and
the infrastructure redeveloped on the island, but we
will require the continued support of the international
community in those efforts. We also look forward to
the assistance of the proposed Peacebuilding
Commission in such endeavours.
Papua New Guinea, like many other small island
developing States, suffers from natural disasters, such
as volcanic eruptions, floods, cyclones, landslides,
droughts and even tsunamis. The ongoing and never-
31

ending cycle of natural disasters continues to pose
great difficulties for Papua New Guinea’s achievement
of social and economic progress, including its
achievement of the MDGs and other development
objectives. Papua New Guinea therefore supports the
establishment of early warning systems for all natural
disasters and hazards.
Papua New Guinea’s coexistence with the
environment was enshrined in the preamble of our
national Constitution at the time of the country’s
independence in 1975. That constitutional imperative
guided our commitment to implement the sustainable
development goals and objectives resulting from the
Rio Earth Summit, including the World Summit on
Social Development outcome, the Barbados
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development
of Small Island Developing States and, more recently,
the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation
of the Barbados Programme of Action.
Those multilateral commitments are vital if we
are to ensure the proper management of our country’s
rich natural resources and address critical issues, such
as poverty eradication, climate change, sea-level rise
and natural-disaster management.
Legal and policy frameworks have been put in
place to enable us to pursue development in a
sustainable manner. Our Government is committed to
undertaking economic development activities, such as
mining, forestry and agriculture, in a sustainable
manner.
We call upon the United Nations and the
international community to recognize the weakest,
smallest and most vulnerable peoples of the small
island developing States. The recently adopted
Mauritius Strategy identifies certain commitments that
must be fulfilled if we are to address the sustainable
development and other development aspirations of
small island developing States. The international
community must, including at this General Assembly
session, translate those commitments into action,
through projects relating to water, sanitation and
renewable energy and by addressing training and
capacity-development needs. In this regard, we support
the call for the mobilization of financial resources on a
more predictable basis so as to implement the strategy
as articulated in the summit outcome document.
As a Member of the United Nations, we
emphasize that all nations have a critical responsibility
to address climate change, including sea-level rise. If
we are to achieve lasting climatic stability, we must
have a global commitment to the objectives of the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The relationship between environmental
sustainability and poverty is becoming increasingly
clear. Papua New Guinea is therefore of the view that,
when addressing tropical forestry, the world must
better align market incentives with sustainable
outcomes.
In the forested rural areas of my country, the only
real options for economic growth often require the
destruction of natural forests — either when clearing
for agricultural commodities such as coffee, or through
the sale of hardwood timber. Furthermore, the
International Panel on Climate Change found that,
during the 1990s, an estimated 20 to 25 per cent of
annual global carbon emissions were generated through
land-use change, primarily from the degradation of
forest resources. That is the second largest source of
global carbon emissions — second only to the
combustion of fossil fuels. That has to change if we are
to take responsibility to help with issues related to
climate change.
Papua New Guinea is part of a new Coalition for
Rainforest Nations, including Costa Rica and other
countries, and is requesting a global discussion on
access for ecosystem services to the global carbon
markets as a means to alleviate this problem. Simply
put, the present incentives offered by international
markets for agriculture, forestry and emissions
reductions lead directly to deforestation, environmental
degradation and further poverty. We invite more like-
minded nations to join our efforts to create new
markets and to reform outmoded market and regulatory
mechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contribute
more effectively to environmental sustainability,
economic development, climate stability and poverty
reduction.
Oceans and fisheries issues are critical to Papua
New Guinea and to other Pacific island countries.
Oceans and fisheries sustain the livelihood and well-
being of our people and contribute significantly to our
small economies. Sustainable development is a priority
for Pacific island countries, including Papua New
Guinea. We are concerned about the ongoing illegal
fishing activities in the region. We require the support
and assistance of development partners with technical
capacities to strengthen our surveillance capabilities
32

and with regulatory regimes to address these issues of
vital importance.
Papua New Guinea fully supports the entry into
force of the Western and Central Pacific Tuna
Convention. Papua New Guinea welcomes any
assistance that United Nations agencies — including
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations — and other bilateral and multilateral partners
can provide to permit effective functioning of the
Convention secretariat.
The security of Pacific island countries depends
on the collective security efforts of the region and of
the wider Asia-Pacific region. Our regional security
cooperation is attested to in the successful mission
carried out by the Regional Assistance Mission to the
Solomon Islands, organized under the aegis of the
Pacific Islands Forum.
Papua New Guinea condemns international
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Our
support in the fight against this evil is unwavering and
resolute. We have ratified most of the counter-terrorism
treaties, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373
(2001). However, our efforts are being hampered by
technical and resource constraints; hence the need for
the support and assistance of the international
community to ensure effective implementation of those
commitments.
Over the years, Papua New Guinea has called for
bold decisions and leadership on the part of both Israel
and Palestine to exercise restraint and resolve their
disputes through peaceful means. We commend Prime
Minister Sharon and President Abbas for their bold and
strong leadership towards the resolution of this long-
standing issue.
We fully support the positive efforts being carried
out in Iraq and Afghanistan as democracy and the rule
of law take root. These will be enhanced through
economic and social development as well as through
vital infrastructure development. Those efforts,
however, must be supported by the international
community.
We are halfway through the Second International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Progress
must be made to ensure that all the remaining 16
non-self-governing territories, including New
Caledonia, exercise their inalienable right to self-
determination by 2010. We are following the positive
developments taking place in Tokelau, where the
Government of New Zealand is helping the people to
freely exercise their right to self-determination.
South-South cooperation among developing
countries is critical. It paves the way for enhanced
trade relations and cooperation in areas related to the
transfer of technology and know-how to address issues
affecting those countries, including the fight against
HIV/AIDS and the eradication of poverty. Papua New
Guinea welcomes the establishment of the South Fund
for Development and Humanitarian Assistance and the
Government of Qatar’s initial pledge to contribute $20
million to the Fund. We commend the pledges by India
and China to contribute $2 million each to the Fund. It
is a significant step forward for developing countries to
assist needy Members, including small island countries
with vulnerable economies. We call upon the
developed countries to recognize this valuable effort
and to provide support to the Fund.
Papua New Guinea will assume the chairmanship
of the Pacific Islands Forum commencing in October.
As Chair, Papua New Guinea will provide leadership in
our collective efforts to address critical issues facing
member countries, including the adoption of the
Pacific Plan, which is built upon four main pillars,
namely regional security, economic growth, sustainable
development and good governance in the region. It
must become a vehicle for translating the Mauritius
Strategy and the outcomes of the World Summit on
Sustainable Development and the High-level Plenary
Meeting into action on the ground in our respective
member countries. We therefore welcome the support
of our development partners in the implementation of
the Plan after its adoption at the upcoming Forum
meeting to be held at Port Moresby, Papua New
Guinea, in October this year."
3760,60,2005,PLW,"Palau warmly congratulates
the President on his election to the presidency of the
Assembly and assures him of Palau’s full support and
cooperation. We pay tribute to his predecessor, Jean
Ping of the Gabonese Republic, for his effective
leadership.
At last week’s historic summit, our leaders
created an agenda for the world. It is our task to
undertake concrete measures to advance that agenda.
While the outcome document may not have addressed
every issue of importance in a manner that is
satisfactory to all, it is inarguably an excellent starting
point for the hard work that now lies before us. We
must think of it as a floor, rather than a ceiling, for our
efforts.
Palau has much to offer and much to gain from a
stronger United Nations. We are a new country, this
year celebrating our eleventh anniversary as an
independent nation and as a Member of the United
Nations. As Palau takes its place among the community
of nations, a major concern is the development that
will enable us to stand on our own. In particular, Palau
regards the capacity-building expertise of the United
Nations and its agencies as central to these efforts.
As the Secretary-General stated earlier this year
in his report “In larger freedom”, “one of the great
challenges of the new millennium is to insure that all
States are strong enough to meet the many challenges
they face” (A/59/2005, para. 19). He went on to say,
“no country, weak or strong, can realize prosperity in a
vacuum” (ibid., para. 24).
I fear that just such a vacuum exists in many
small island developing States and that Palau is one of
them. Not a single United Nations representative can
be found in Palau to assist the country in moving
forward. The United Nations flag does not fly there. So
when a youngster wants to know whether a capacity-
building internship or scholarship might be available,
there is no one to ask. And when a local
environmentalist wants to know whether a Global
Environmental Facility Small Grant might be available
to assist in the preservation of an endangered species
26

that is important to the whole world, there is no one to
help in submitting an application. In like manner, when
Palau does its part in ratifying an international
agreement, thus accepting the obligation to render
complex reports to an international agency, there is no
one to help.
The United Nations has attempted to fill this
vacuum through the creation of regional and
subregional centres, which are quite distant from
Palau’s shores. While arguably well intentioned, this
tactic has failed to provide Palau with the capacity-
building required and has, similarly, prevented the
world from truly understanding Palau’s needs and
aspirations. In this sense, these regional and
subregional centres merely replicate the colonial
regimes, which the Pacific islands have thrown off —
distant capitals making decisions about far-flung
provinces. To Palau, strengthening the United Nations
means strengthening its marginalized Members.
Palau has willingly taken its place as a
responsible member of the international community.
Heeding the Secretary-General’s call to action, Palau
this year proudly deployed a contingent of police
peacekeepers, who now serve in East Timor. And in
response to the Secretary-General’s stated desire to
develop better gender balance in these missions,
Palau’s contingent is entirely female.
When the world develops important conventions,
often with burdensome reporting requirements, Palau
steps up and signs them, as was the case last week
when Palau’s President Remengesau signed the
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts
of Nuclear Terrorism. And when natural disasters
strike, Palau responds willingly, making significant
financial contributions to remit suffering caused by the
tsunami and by Hurricane Katrina. I submit that in both
of these cases, Palau’s contributions were, on a per
capita basis, among the highest in the world.
Palau asks for very little. But now it asks for
help, and that help should be forthcoming. As our
President Remengesau stated in the Assembly’s 4th
meeting, last week, in his address to the world summit:
“It is therefore time for the international
community, and the United Nations as its
representative, to begin to move beyond studies
that recognize past failures to achieve sustainable
development in our island nations, and to move
aggressively forward and to establish a specific
programme agenda that recognizes our unique
smallness, that appreciates our distinctive
diversity, and that respects our island cultures as
equal to those in other nations of this world.”
Palau’s development challenges are different
from those of many of our friends around the world
who have taken this podium. Hunger is not an issue at
present in paradise. But the challenges that confront
the small island nations of the Pacific may ultimately
be every bit as devastating as famine.
Climate change and sea-level rise threaten to
obliterate our islands. The very poignant and moving
statement of His Excellency Anote Tong, Beretitenti of
the Republic of Kiribati at the 15th meeting last week
contained a chilling preview of what the unchecked
scourge of carbon emissions could mean to all of the
countries in the Pacific, and of course to many other
oceans of the world. The President acknowledged that
the Government of Kiribati needed now “to seriously
consider the option of having to relocate our peoples
when necessary”. In this understated Pacific way, the
President forces us all to confront a world where whole
countries simply disappear from the globe. Is there a
more compelling call to action than that?
The period leading up to such a catastrophe is
upon us. Palau must rely on the maintenance of its
extraordinary reefs and waters and its unparalleled
biodiversity to attract tourists. Without these assets, it
will be unable to develop a sustainable economy and to
create jobs, which will allow its children to live and
work in their homeland.
The other pillar of Palau’s development is its
fisheries. For countless generations, our people have
relied on their waters for their sustenance. Now,
foreign fishing fleets, which have denuded the waters
proximate to their own harbours, have come to the
Pacific and threaten to do the same. The very food
chain is threatened by new fishing practices that,
though in their infancy, have begun to damage Pacific
seamounts in ways that the scientific community deems
alarming. It is for this reason that Palau has called for a
moratorium on deep sea bottom trawling until the
scientific community can gauge the long-term impact
of that practice. We renew that call today and applaud
Costa Rica for its leadership on this important issue.
We take this opportunity and we are grateful for
this opportunity to commend Palau’s bilateral partners
and friends who have overcome our new nation’s

remoteness to become involved and knowledgeable
about our needs and aspirations. The United States has
provided in-country diplomatic representation and
years of support for our vital democracy.
Japan has also provided in-country diplomatic
representation and invaluable assistance. Like the
United States, Japan has been steadily involved in
Palau’s development, and I would submit that this
special familiarity with Palau’s people has enhanced
Japan and the United States every bit as much as it has
aided Palau.
Palau has been disappointed by the failure of the
General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session to
accomplish Security Council reform, particularly
because Japan’s deep knowledge of our region would
inform Council members who have less familiarity
with the situation of the Pacific islands. We supported
and continue to support therefore the Group of Four
resolution and hope that the sixtieth General Assembly
will finish this critical work that was begun last year.
A third steady supporter of Palau’s development
has been the Republic of China on Taiwan. We
continue to assert that the world would be benefited by
Taiwan’s membership in this august body. This year
Palau was a sponsor of a resolution calling for a
proactive role for the United Nations in addressing the
rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait. We regret that the
debate on that important resolution was foreshortened
in the General Committee and that we were prevented
from expressing our views on this topic; however we
are glad that we have an opportunity to do that now.
The people of the Pacific, and the Pacific island
nations themselves, are under-represented in the
Secretariat and in the governing bodies, commissions
and tribunals of the world. Our cohesive and effective
regional group, the Pacific Islands Forum, is most
fortunate in having Australia and New Zealand among
us. But it is time, we submit, for the new island nations
to take a more active role and to share their unique and
graceful Pacific way with the rest of the world. It is
quite possible, I submit, that the islands are
marginalized in part by the irrational composition of
the regional groups. Strengthening the United Nations
should include a realignment of the groups to better
reflect the proliferation of Pacific countries, which has
occurred in the last 20 years, and the actual geography
of the world. This would allow the island nations to
compete more effectively for seats on major bodies.
For this reason, Palau suggests the reform of the
system and the creation of an East Asia and Pacific
Group and that this group include, of course with their
consent, our friends in Australia and New Zealand."
3799,60,2005,NZL,"Sixty years ago,
Prime Minister Peter Fraser of New Zealand told
representatives to the San Francisco Conference that its
sole aim should be
“the setting up of a world organization that will
really work, and that will be the background for
an orderly progress towards security, prosperity
and happiness for all the people of all nations”.
The new organization would only work, he said, if its
members were determined to stand by their
commitments and principles.
Today the essential concept of the United Nations
remains robust. We can be justly proud of its
achievements in many areas including humanitarian
assistance, development and peacekeeping. But we
have collectively underperformed in others, sometimes
with tragic results.
Our task this sixtieth anniversary is twofold: first,
to recommit ourselves as Member States to the
enduring vision and values of the Charter and,
19

secondly, to retool the United Nations machinery to
meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
The Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) provides
the blueprint for the way forward. New Zealand would
have liked more progress in a number of areas, such as
more detailed agreement on the establishment of the
Human Rights Council and more authority to the
Secretary-General to manage resources in return for
greater accountability. We deeply regret the failure to
endorse further disarmament and non-proliferation
measures.
But we are encouraged by the many significant
advances, including recognition of the need for more
and better aid, establishment of the Peacebuilding
Commission, a doubling of resources for the Office of
the Commissioner for Human Rights and the
recognition of our shared “responsibility to protect”.
We have as our theme for the General Assembly
implementation of our summit undertakings. We share
accountability for getting the job done. I shall confine
my comments here to the results of the summit.
New Zealand is pleased with the Summit
Outcome as it relates to development. It represents a
shared commitment by all Member States to the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
recognizes the important partnership between
developed and developing countries in the effective use
of aid.
This year New Zealand has increased its
development assistance by 23 per cent. Our official
development assistance (ODA) programme has a focus
on poverty elimination, with a core, but not exclusive,
focus on the Pacific. We strive to address aid
effectiveness, the particular problems faced by small
island developing States, HIV/AIDS, the empowerment
of women, sexual and reproductive health and rights,
education for all, sustainable development and trade
access.
On trade, we look forward to an ambitious
outcome across all aspects of the Doha Development
Agenda, including in agriculture, improved market
access, the elimination of export subsidies and
substantial reductions in trade distorting domestic
support. Improving the coherence of trade policies and
development initiatives remains a critical element in
achieving the MDGs.
New Zealand welcomes the decision to establish
a Peacebuilding Commission to help break the cycle of
conflict by better coordinating long-term international
recovery efforts and ensuring sustained political
attention to those who need it. We must now move
swiftly to get the Commission up and running by
December this year. We look to the General Assembly
President to take a lead in holding consultations to
achieve this. The core elements of the framework have
already been discussed at length and in detail. With
good will and determination, we can surely arrive at
agreement within the next few weeks on a package.
This should ensure balanced membership and flexible
reporting arrangements. We would caution against
raising the bar for assistance too high, and we hope
that all States in need of help will be able to approach
the Commission.
Our leaders have spoken with one voice and
unequivocally to condemn all forms of terrorism. We
must build on this and honour our undertaking to
conclude negotiations on the comprehensive
convention on international terrorism at this session.
New Zealand will continue to work closely with our
friends in the Pacific region to improve our collective
abilities to identify, prevent or respond to terrorist
threats. Consolidating reporting requirements created
by Security Council resolutions would, we believe, be
one step towards enhancing the counter-terrorism
programme of the United Nations. We think it very
important that Member States should now support the
Secretary-General’s counter-terrorism strategy.
One of the most far-reaching achievements of the
summit, as many countries have acknowledged, is our
collective acceptance that there is a responsibility to
protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity. We must now
all be prepared to assist the United Nations in
establishing the early warning capability referred to in
our outcome document. It is vital that, when the need
arises, we give effect to our resolve and follow the
principles we have agreed upon.
In this context, New Zealand wishes to reaffirm
its commitment to ending impunity for those
responsible for the most serious crimes of concern to
the international community. Adoption of the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court was an
historic moment for the United Nations and one that
demonstrated the breadth and depth of political will to
end impunity and to secure the rule of law.
20

The absence of any reference to a commitment to
end impunity or of any acknowledgement of the
International Criminal Court’s central contribution to
this goal is one of several telling silences in our
summit outcome.
We are particularly pleased that leaders have
recognized the need to conclude, during this session,
negotiations on the draft protocol to the Convention on
the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.
This will be a major priority for New Zealand. We call
on all Member States to contribute constructively to
this process, so that we can reach agreement on a
protocol and demonstrate our full support for the work
of United Nations personnel in the field.
New Zealand welcomes the emphasis on human
rights in the outcome document. That the budget of the
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is
to be doubled and her Office strengthened is an
overdue recognition of the gap between expectations of
delivery and resourcing.
While progress has been made through the
summit decision to establish a Human Rights Council,
we regret that the opportunity was lost to reach
agreement on details of the Council’s mandate and
operation, despite the support of a great majority of
Members for such a package. A small minority cannot
be allowed to veto the establishment of the Council.
Over the next weeks we must redouble our efforts
to translate that broad support into specifics on what
the Council will look like and on its mandate. We shall
look to the President to set a work programme that will
aim for agreement on the details.
Our second human rights priority for the sixtieth
session is to see negotiations completed on the draft
convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.
The constructive and collegial spirit of delegations in
the Ad Hoc Committee on the rights of persons with
disabilities has been extraordinary. New Zealand is
confident that it will be possible to conclude the
negotiations in 2006 if the Ad Hoc Committee is
enabled to meet for three weeks next January.
Our ability to strengthen the United Nations
across the board in development, security and human
rights will be enhanced by implementing summit
undertakings on Secretariat and management reform.
We need particularly to improve the managerial
effectiveness and accountability of the Secretary-
General. He should be given, as he has requested, the
tools that he needs to manage the Secretariat.
We strongly support the review of all budgetary
and human resource rules and regulations and the
review of mandates. We support also the increased
focus on ensuring ethical conduct on the part of all
United Nations personnel. We believe a system-wide
code of ethics and an independent ethics office would
facilitate that. New Zealand also welcomes the
commitment to strengthening the United Nations
Office of Internal Oversight Services.
The outcome document calls for early reform of
the Security Council, and the General Assembly is to
review progress on this issue by the end of the year.
New Zealand continues to believe that the Security
Council needs to be more effective and more
representative for the twenty-first century, although we
have no illusions about the difficulties of reaching
agreement on this.
We should in the meantime renew our efforts to
improve the working methods of the Security Council.
For those many Member States who rarely, if ever,
occupy a non-permanent seat on the Council, there
should be other ways to participate in Council
decisions and contribute to discussions.
We, as Member States, have shown in finalizing
the summit outcome a mixture of courage and
creativity on the one hand and of stubbornness and
hesitation on the other. The implementation period
ahead gives us a second chance to make good on those
moments when we allowed agreements to slip through
our fingers. We put our trust in our President to set up
the structures for ongoing work and to be the catalyst
to motivate and energize us.
In closing, I would like to acknowledge the much
valued contribution that former President Ping made
over the last year, and we thank him."

On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea I have the honour to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the important post of President of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation shares the confidence that the members of this august body have placed in your leadership. Let me assure you of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of the high duties entrusted to you.
I wish to take this opportunity to record my country's appreciation of your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury for a job well done. We were impressed by the manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly at its last session.
My delegation also commends the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his unwavering efforts in upholding the principles and purposes set forth in the United Nations Charter. His report (A/42/1), which we have studied with great interest, will make an important contribution to our deliberations. My Government's policy of independent commitment to international co-operation includes a firm commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. For all countries, regardless of size, wealth or might, the United Nations is an Organization we all need despite some of the problems and challenges it faces. The United Nations bears the banner of hope for international co-operation based on mutual respect.
My delegation views with serious concern the track record of the United Nations Security Council. We believe there is a need to desensitise the role of the Council because, more often than not, it has failed to live up to the high expectations placed on it. The increasing tendency for the Security Council to be used as a forum for East-West power brokerage is most unsatisfactory. My  Government is concerned that the United Nations should be held hostage to such trends. Furthermore we support the calls for an increase in the number of permanent seats in the Security Council. The provisions regarding the veto should also be reviewed in order to fully protect and promote the principles and purposes set forth in the United Nations Charter.
The complex issues of South Africa/ Namibia, the Middle East/ Kampuchea/ Afghanistan/ the Korean Peninsula/ the Iran-Iraq conflict/ the situations in Cyprus and Central America all require genuine efforts on the part of all concerned for their resolution.
It is evident that some among us are prepared to allow the situation in South Africa to continue/ the struggle for a Palestinian homeland to continue/ and the I ran-Iraq war to continue.
The situation in Kampuchea remains unresolved. The narrow self-interest and indifference on the part of some Members of this Organization are deplorable.
Since the adoption of the historic I960 Declaration on decolonization/ many countries, including my own, have attained independence. The concerns which brought about the 1960 Declaration still exist today. Although the number of colonial territories has decreased/ there are some who still continue to suffer the indignities of colonialism.
The United Nations has before it the important task of bringing these situations to an end. The colonialists/ and those who benefit from the outdated legacy of colonialism continue to do so without the slightest sign of a sense of guilt.
Namibia continues to be subjected to the worst form of colonialism. Its resources are plundered. The overwhelming international support for Namibian independence has not moved South Africa and the other sponsors of colonialism in that territory. When will those who collaborate with South Africa come to realize that their actions and self-serving policies perpetuate South Africa's policy of apartheid?
We commend SWAPO for its fine leadership in the struggle for Namibia's independence. We express our solidarity with the people of Namibia and appeal to all to unite in the struggle to achieve the ultimate aim of independence. Whether it be in Namibia, New Caledonia or in any other of the remaining colonial territories, the colonialists and those who collaborate with them advance untenable arguments to defend their interests. Some who ought to know better because they too were victims of colonialism readily subscribe to such absurdities.
It is of great concern to my country that the process of decolonization in the Pacific has not been completed. The situation in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, especially that in Palau, causes some degree of uncertainty and apprehension. We urge the Administering Authority to ensure that the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement is achieved as soon as possible, and is consistent with the aspirations of the people of that Territory.
May I be permitted, on behalf of my Government, to applaud the members of this august body who demonstrated their solidarity with the people of New Caledonia and said 'No' to colonialism during the last session of the General Assembly. Many said 'No' to colonialism when they gave their support to General Assembly resolution 41/41 A by which New Caledonia was re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those who stood up to be counted for the principles they believe in did so despite enormous economic and political pressures.
In this day and age there is no defence for colonialism. It is my delegation's hope that those who gave France the benefit of the doubt will now come out in support of self-determination and independence for New Caledonia. The current situation in New Caledonia is one of great uncertainty. France refuses to co-operate with the United Nations, thereby reneging on the responsibilities entrusted to it under the Charter as an Administering Authority. Such disregard for an important responsibility is most regrettable for a country which occupies a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and boasts of its democratic institutions. The people of New Caledonia, particularly the indigenous people, the Kanaks, are determined to secure independence for themselves with the guidance of the United Nations.
To ensure a legitimate and genuine act of self-determination, France must address the important issue of franchise. Without doing so, any act of self-determination would be meaningless. The countries members of the South Pacific Forum are as determined as ever to see New Caledonia exercise its right to self-determination and gain independence in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations. We ask for no more and no less.
We appeal to France to honour its obligations under the United Nations Charter as an administering Power to decolonise New Caledonia in co-operation with the United Nations. France must come to terms with the fact that the independence of New Caledonia is inevitable and that the responsibility for achieving that end peacefully rests with the Administering Authority.
Papua New Guinea stands firm with the South Pacific Forum countries in our condemnation of the so-called referendum which the French Government staged on 13 September of this year in New Caledonia, an exercise which the Kanak people have rejected outright. The French-sponsored referendum in New Caledonia proved nothing and achieved nothing. It has created more tension in New Caledonia and within the region. The boycott of the referendum by the indigenous people showed the strength of their determination to attain their independence from France. Papua New Guinea's relations with countries and organizations in the South Pacific and South-East Asia are among those we regard to be of primary concern to our country. Papua New Guinea is an active participant in South Pacific affairs through major regional organizations, particularly the South Pacific Forum and its related bodies.
Countries of the South Pacific have important economic links with the European Economic Community, Japan, the United States of America, Australia and New Zealand. We welcome the contribution these countries make in promoting economic development in our region.
The region's relations with other countries in the North Pacific, including China, the Soviet Union and South Korea, are becoming stronger and more diverse. 
There are changing trends in the Pacific. Our region is gaining more attention from other countries and organizations than in the past. Papua New Guinea highly values its relations with the South Pacific Area and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) . Both organizations play a constructive role in promoting understanding and co-operation among countries within these two regions and beyond. Countries of the South Pacific are keen to promote a stable and peaceful environment that is conducive to economic advancement by all Pacific Island communities.
We welcome the constructive involvement of other countries and international organizations in the South Pacific. Their involvement should recognize the special problems of island countries in the Pacific, and their legitimate interests, particularly in advancing economic co-operation.
My Government's priority since taking office has been to stimulate economic development in the country and to improve the welfare of our people. Our efforts to achieve results to large a extent depends on conditions in the wider international environment. We are not immune from the influences of the world economy, especially the trend towards restrictive trade, fluctuations in the prices for commodities, and the slowdown in the flow of capital resources from developed countries to developing countries. Efforts to promote the cause of international co-operation are not meaningful unless they address such vital issues which directly bear on the livelihood of our people. 
The recent important International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development highlights the increasing need to make better use of available resources for the benefit of mankind, and not for destruction. Like other developing countries, we see the need for urgent measures to be taken to improve and liberalize international trading arrangements, particularly with the major trading nations, and to stimulate the flow of capital resources to promote economic development in developing countries. Urgent measures are also required to alleviate the rising debt crisis. 
We welcome the recent conclusion of the multilateral fisheries agreement between South Pacific countries and the United States of America. It will contribute towards economic development in our region. We also welcome the interest shown by other countries towards the South Pacific. Development assistance arrangements should be for the purpose of contributing to the social and economic development of the South Pacific countries, and not for other reasons or motives.
Any substantial progress towards arms control and disarmament must necessarily begin with the two super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, accompanied by complementary efforts by nuclear-weapon States. Without such undertakings, world disarmament efforts will fall far short of expectations. The initiatives and dialogue now underway between the United States and the Soviet Union on disarmament are encouraging. Like most countries, we are anxious to see progress made in this area, which will lead to concrete results. My Government believes that confidence building and resolution of regional conflicts can contribute greatly to an environment conducive for disarmament.
The South Pacific is also not immune from nuclear activities. Countries of the South Pacific have taken a step forward in seeking to prevent nuclear activities in the region. A South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty has been concluded between countries of the region, and nuclear-weapon States have been invited to sign related protocols concerning the operations of the arrangement.
In late 198b, a Convention for the protection and development of the natural resources and environment of the South Pacific was concluded, and is now open for signature.
We commend the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union for their positive responses in signing the protocols to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. We call on other nuclear-weapon states to act positively and also sign those protocols. 
Despite these initiatives I have outlined above, one country, France, which is involved in our region, still chooses to defy common regional endeavours, from nuclear testing in Polynesia, together with increased militarization of New Caledonia, and intimidation of the indigenous people, the Kanaks, in New Caledonia, are a great source of tension and insecurity within the South Pacific. Like other countries, Papua New Guinea remains totally opposed to French nuclear testing in Polynesia. We call for an immediate halt to French nuclear testing in the Pacific and for that country to respect the efforts of the countries of the South Pacific to keep the region nuclear free, and for the environment and natural resources of that region to be developed for the benefit of the people of our region.
We can only encourage negotiation and conclusion of other nuclear-free zones in other parts of the world. The situation in Kampuchea continues to pose a threat to regional peace and stability. The situation is further exacerbated by the continuing presence of foreign forces in Kampuchea against the wishes of the people of that country. Total withdrawal of foreign troops must take place to enable the people of Kampuchea to choose democratically their own government, without outside interference, subversion or coercion. We appeal to the different political factions in Kampuchea to remain united for the common objective of seeking to regain the sovereign entity of Kampuchea. My Government commends ASEAN for its abiding interest and dedication in trying to promote a peaceful resolution to the problems faced by Kampuchea.
On the southern tip of Africa the evils of apartheid continue to take their toll. The Papua New Guinea Government shares the view that a comprehensive system of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa is the most effective peaceful means available to the international community to bring about an end to apartheid. The world has already witnessed an escalation of violence and bloodshed, of inhuman treatment towards fellow human beings.
The problem of South Africa has become a subject of policy experiments and of hollow rhetoric, and thus an end to apartheid remains an urgent and unfulfilled obligation for the international community. Those who are able to help reverse the situation in South Africa continue to find endless excuses and shirk their responsibilities.
We appeal to those who have the capacity to influence democratic changes in South Africa to demonstrate the necessary political will, and in solidarity with the international community, dismantle apartheid.
In this respect, the Security Council has an urgent task in fulfilling its responsibility to ensure peace and security in South Africa. The Security Council has demonstrated its unity of purpose on the Iran-Iraq conflict j and we expect it to demonstrate a similar spirit in resolving the problems of apartheid in South Africa.
I have outlined my Government's views on only a number of issues listed on the agenda of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. In so doing, my delegation does not in any way ignore the importance and urgency of other issues before this session. The many complex problems and challenges confronting the international community require genuine efforts and commitment by all States Members of the United Nations in the search for acceptable solutions. Papua New Guinea supports a strengthened United Nations system so that it can fulfil its mandate as well as the high expectations of member countries. My country is committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. 
"
3903,42,1987,AUS,"﻿It had been the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Hayden, to be present at this session of the General Assembly for his general debate statement. It is evidence of the Australian Government's deep attachment to the United Nations and the principles which underlie the Organization that Mr. Hayden has presented each Australian general debate statement since his appointment in 1983. On this occasion, however, events in our own region compelled Mr. Hayden to return home from New York. The statement I shall now make is the statement Mr. Hayden would have delivered if it had been possible for him to attend this session.
Let me first extend to Mr. Peter Florin my congratulations on his assumption the presidency of the forty-second session of the General Assembly. At the same time I should like to express Australia's warm appreciation to the outgoing President and representative of a fellow Commonwealth country, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh.
As Australia prepares to commemorate the 200 years which have passed since the first European settlement in 1788, a feeling of celebration is naturally enough developing in my country But there is also occurring in Australia a new degree o analysis of the developments that have brought Australia to its present condition and the reasons for them. As a result, more Australians are becoming more clear about the real meaning of their past and their future.
Australia's relative advantages in the production and export of raw materials served us well in colonial times and have continued to be the mainstay of our exports until the present. The sharp decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities — something we share with many developing countries - has/ however  made it clear to us that we need to diversify our export base without neglecting our traditional strengths.
At the same time we are finding that our past policies which created a sheltered and protected environment for manufactured goods and services, have poorly prepared those sectors of our economy for competition in world markets. We are now addressing seriously the task of structural adjustment, which is needed to put our economy on a more mature footing.
Our bicentenary particularly reminds Australians of the extent of the disruption suffered by the original inhabitants of our country, the Aboriginal people, now a minority in the land. Australia, in other words, is at an especially important point in its development, seeking to understand the reality of its past and preparing for the realities of its future. Our economic and industrial structures are undergoing fundamental out necessary reform.
Australians are going through an equally stressful process towards a proper understanding of the effect of their history on their Aboriginal compatriots. That demands great change - in such matters as land rights, protection of cultural systems and heritage and economic development. It is a difficult, complex process, often frustrating, always demanding unusual understanding and new attitudes of mind. So, in their bicentenary year, Australians are going through a period both of celebration and of deep reflection. I mention this because the process gives Australians a better appreciation of many of the issues that are preoccupying the world community; because we all have a significant stake in seeing these issues dealt with effectively, expeditiously and fairly.
With such a perspective, two issues are clearly of immediate importance and pressing concern; one is our failure to agree on systematic, effective and just ways to solve the problem of international debt; the other is the distortion of world markets and the resultant hardship to innocent bystanders caused by the trade policies of the major economies.
The two issues are connected, not least in that they both threaten grave consequences for all - industrial nations and developing nations. North and South alike. In this context I commend Ambassador Yeutter's comment to members of the United States Congress last February, 'Would that our grandchildren were to understand what we are doing to them.'
Present international economic conditions reflect the difficult economic circumstances in both rich and poor countries. The latest world development report of the World Bank points out some of the dangers in the international economy and mentions the need for the wealthier countries to face more squarely the damage that their domestic policies are causing the developing countries. It is therefore time to ask whether or not the paralysis in economic policy-making is becoming so serious that the world economy is on the verge of sliding into an era of stagnation and protectionism.
The Baker plan set out the framework for the resolution of the international debt crisis. It was an attempt to forge an international consensus in which the different parties would all contribute to a solution and they would all gain from co-operation. Unfortunately, the plan in our view is not working, mainly because the richer parties have not been pulling their weight. Not only have the wealthier countries failed to tackle fiscal and trading imbalances, but private international banks have also failed to support the Baker plan. As a result, there is really no effective world plan to solve the continuing international debt crisis.
Although the Baker plan has in essence failed, its three original elements remain the key to the solution of the world economic crisis. These elements are, first, that heavily indebted developing countries need to formulate and implement structural adjustment plans at home, in particular by curbing excessive Government spending and promoting exports in an endeavour to service their international debts; secondly, creditor nations in turn would need to support structural adjustments in the developing countries through such institutions as the World Bank, by increasing resources flows to the heavily indebted countries thirdly, private international banks would also be expected to support such a plan.
It is important, however, to resist the notion that the first step to a solution is to allocate blame to one side or another. The great task is to find a solution that does not, on the one hand, destabilize the international financial system or, on the other hand, increase the severity of the social and political burdens which the debt crisis imposes on the people of less developed nations.
In this, each side to the issue has a great responsibility. Debtor nations should not undermine the financial system by walking away from their obligations. Creditor nations cannot insist on debt repayment pressed to the point that it destroys the human and other resources of debtor nations. Each side must therefore recognize the validity of the other's point of view. 
A solution should be approached by seeking, not only to maximize the advantage of all concerned, but also to ensure that the broad economic interdependence between nations is recognized. Neither party can be seen in isolation, important interdependences must be considered, including the responsibilities of the debtor countries, the creditor countries, the private banks and the multilateral agencies. It is in the long-term interest of all parties to co-operate in overcoming these grave and continuing economic difficulties.
In the long term the solution also demands some form of broad structure that would help to invest resources intelligently and would establish, in advance, ways in which debt could be repaid more effectively, more systematically and more fairly. This requires a more supportive external economic environment, which must include adequate external financing in support of macroeconomic and structural policies in debtor countries, efforts by surplus industrial countries to maintain the maximum rate of growth they can afford, continued reductions in international interest rates, and action by the major industrialized countries to reduce protectionism, including protectionism in agriculture.
In addition to these points, another critical ingredient should be a co-ordinated economic adjustment by the major economies: a managed mixture of monetary and fiscal change and reduced trade protection along the lines emphasized at various economic summits. The alternative to such managed adjustment is the chaos which will result when the market enforces its own adjustment to the detriment of both culpable participants and innocent bystanders alike. This is an essential point: the policies driving towards this conclusion are not only endangering the interests of developing countries; they also threaten the interests of the developed countries.
The dangers to the world economy are equally serious from trade protectionism, which is such a feature of the current world trading environment. The World Bank has warned of the results of the resurgence of protection in the form of non-tariff barriers to trade in manufactures. This policy will undermine the integrity of the system of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT') even further and will impede the exports of less developed countries, which in turn will aggravate their debt problem.
Unfair trade in agricultural products is especially serious. Indeed, it is potentially ruinous. The Tokyo Summit offered not much more than a bare acknowledgement of the problem almost 18 months ago although it was the first time that the major economies admitted that there was a problem and that it needed their joint attention. Their perception of it has changed significantly since then. The change has been noticeable at such developments as the GATT meeting at Punta del Este a year ago, at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Ministerial Council in Paris last May, and at the Venice Summit last June. Indeed, the Venice Summit made an important commitment towards reforming agricultural trade by calling on all involved to refrain from actions which 'by further stimulating production of agricultural commodities in surplus, increasing protection or destabilizing world markets' (ft/42/344, para. 20) would damage trade relations. 
This increase in consciousness of the problem over only 18 months has been an important and, in the Australian Government's view a hopeful, development in that it injects urgency into finding ways to solve a problem which is contributing significantly to uncertainty and disorder in the global economic system.
Distortions in global agricultural trade caused by barriers to market access and subsidization policies of the major economies have seriously affected Australia, among other efficient and competitive producers. They have raised a huge impediment to the efforts of the Australian Government towards recovery from our economic difficulties of the early 1980s. Australia, therefore, attaches high priority to the Uruguay round of multilateral negotiations on agriculture. Australia's concern led it to joining 13 other non-subsidizing exporters in the Cairns Group of fair traders in agriculture in August last year. That group played an important role at Punta del Este in the successful campaign to include agriculture in the negotiating mandate and for the mandate to encompass negotiation of rules for all measures affecting market access and export competition.
These negotiations on agriculture will be a major test of the commitment of GATT members to an open, market-oriented trading system. The GATT rules and disciplines which have overseen world trade for the last 40 years have never been extended to cover agricultural products in a comparable way to their coverage of manufactures. This failure has been a major problem in the current world economic environment.
Australia put a proposal to the European Management Forum at Davos in January of this year to help solve problems in world trade in agriculture. Our proposal underlined the need to reassert the role of comparative advantage in shaping world trade in agriculture and to restore the link between market signals and production trends. Our proposal aimed progressively to reduce the gap which exists between world and domestic prices in many countries, and it called for the careful management of stocks to restore order in world markets. Acceptance of such an approach would produce a world order in agricultural trade in which comparative advantage and market signals are once more the major influences. But it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the most important and necessary ingredient in programmes to alleviate the crisis in agricultural trade is immediate action by the major agricultural subsidizers to eliminate all agricultural subsidies.
As with international debt, a solution will emerge, one way or another, to the problems caused by unfair trading. What is not so clear is whether it will be a benign solution or a disorderly one; whether it will be a planned solution by well-informed and well-intentioned policymakers; or a chaotic one forced on recalcitrant governments by market forces driven by uncertainty and frustration. If markets enforce their own solutions to the problems of international debt and unfair trading, there will be instability in foreign exchange rates and on commodity exchanges, debtor default, world recession and world tension, or even worse.
With such serious prospects threatening us all, some blunt truths need to be expressed to those who have the capacity to find and enforce sensible solutions. Unfair trading is in essence an extremely unfriendly act - even a hostile one. One should not be surprised, therefore, if its victims react accordingly.
Secondly, if developed economies' policies, particularly protectionist policies, impoverish their customers, they themselves will suffer the consequences of reduced export prospects and restricted world trade. Finally, when unfair trading reduces the capacity of countries like Australia to promote political and social stability through aid programmes, one should not be surprised if donor countries like Australia, find themselves forced to reduce these aid programmes. 
This threat of economic and political instability adds weight and urgency to the third great imperative facing the world community; control of armaments, to which I now turn. Australia argued at the recent Conference on disarmament and development that security is a wider concept than a definition in purely military terms would allow. In our view, security has important economic and social, as well as military, dimensions.
Disarmament and development may not be tied together in an exclusive relationship; the abolition of arms may not lead automatically to the abolition of our economic problems. But it is a fact that military spending does take up a disproportionate share of global resources: this has been estimated to be 20 times the amount disbursed through official development assistance. Arms imports, to take another example, are responsible for roughly one-quarter of the debt burden of the nations of the South.
While Australia believes that effective and lasting disarmament should lead to larger and more predictable flows of assistance to less developed countries, we also believe that the economic benefits of the implementation of a wider concept of security will be of greater importance to all countries.
The other obvious, major reason for the urgency in dealing with the arms race, particularly the nuclear-arms race, is the destruction that it threatens. Australia warmly welcomes the prospect that the United States and the Soviet Union will reach an intermediate nuclear forces (INF) agreement, and particularly we welcome their decision to eliminate ground-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asian region as well.
If this agreement is reached, three critically important principles will have been accepted. One is that it will be the first agreement which not only reduces but also entirely eliminates a whole class of modern, front-line nuclear arsenals. It will also give concrete expression to the principle that security cannot be achieved by a build-up in weapons alone. And it will bear witness to the idea that security can be enhanced by balanced and verifiable arms reduction and disarmament assures. 
Regrettably, the chances of an agreement to reduce the levels of strategic nuclear arms have not advanced far since the Reykjavik Summit last year. Discussions in the defence and space components of the negotiations between the super-Powers have also not yet achieved a breakthrough. In the strong belief that the issue is not the preserve only of the nuclear Powers, Australia has been an energetic participant in efforts by the international community to achieve nuclear-arms control and disarmament. We have urged the leaders of both the United States and the Soviet Union not to miss the opportunity apparently before them now o reach accord on all the topics under negotiation. Further progress on the issue f strategic arms would be greatly facilitated by agreements also to eliminate chemical weapons and to control conventional weapons. 
In a specific field to which Australia has devoted special attention, our resolution with New Zealand last year on the urgent need for a comprehensive test-ban treaty attracted the highest support of any of the draft resolutions submitted to the Assembly on the issue of nuclear testing. We are co-operating again this year with New Zealand and our other traditional co-sponsors to produce draft resolution which reflects a practical, non-declaratory approach to a treat which we hope will receive very wide support.
We have also taken steps towards the development of an international system monitoring network so that the necessary verification measures will be ready for test-ban treaty. And we have made special efforts to contribute to the international effort to eliminate chemical weapons, efforts which appear to be close to fruition,
Australians share with other peoples good reasons for this active interest this issue: that is, the extra dimension of danger which unconstrained armament add to developments which are already unstable.
I refer in this context, to the Middle East dispute, the war between Iraq and Iran, the deteriorating situation in southern Africa and the divisions between North and South Koreans. Australia continues to support the principle that the international community has a major role in resolving such disputes.
We especially support the Security Council and the Secretary-General in the efforts to end the Iraq-Iran conflict. We support the proposal that the United Nations should contribute to reconciling North and South Korea by admitting both Members of the Organization. Both North and South Korea have, for example, recently acceded to the Antarctic Treaty.
We profoundly regret that the Government of South Africa continues to turn back on the sincere demands of the world community for genuine dialogue and peaceful change in that troubled country, that it continues to reject the legitimate aspirations of the majority black population to political rights. The actions of the international community in adopting economic and other measures against South Africa are welcomed by Australia, which understands the growing anger and frustration of African countries in the face of continuing South African intransigence.
Australia also continues to be concerned by the plight of the Kampuchean people and disappointed at the lack of movement towards a political settlement during the past eight years. We hope that the increased level of activity in recent months represents real elements of flexibility among the parties and that it might free the way to the start of talks and lead to an end to foreign occupation of Kampuchea and to the self-determination of its people. There are also some encouraging signs of progress in Central America.
Australians have a particularly compelling reason for their energetic interest in the arms issue, to which I have just referred. The region in which we live is feeling ever more strongly the pressures exerted by the clash of ideology, distortions in the world economy, the legacy of colonialism and the rivalry between the super-Powers. Our immediate neighbourhood is mercifully relatively free of the immediate military effects of these pressures. With our island neighbours, we are concerned to ensure that the South Pacific remains peaceful. This is why we are committed to the principle that the South Pacific and the Antarctic continent remain nuclear-free under the arrangements established for these zones. We believe that the disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty, which ensure that the territory of Antarctica is used only for peaceful purposes and the obligations that the Treaty carries for the effective management of the Antarctic in support of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, continue to be in the best interests of all peoples.
That is also the reason for the concern felt by Australia and its island neighbours for a viable, peaceful political solution in New Caledonia. We believe that the people of New Caledonia should have been given a wider range of options in the recent referendum and that this referendum should have been conducted in a manner consistent with the established United Nations principles of decolonization. We trust, nevertheless, that a peaceful transition to a truly multiracial independence will take place in New Caledonia and that the situation there will not be allowed to threaten the stability of the region. This is of course a matter to which the United Nations Special Committee of 24 has been devoting its attention, in which process we are interested.
Australia also shares with its South Pacific neighbours concern over the destructive effects of the protectionist commodity policies of major economies. Small primary producers with fragile economies tend to be the first to feel the effects of these policies and the last to recover from them. The South Pacific is a region with many examples of this distressing reality. In such circumstances, the prospects of preserving its peaceful nature depend not only on fair and rational solutions to the problems of unfair trading and colonialism, but also on a realistic resolution of the arms issue. Peace in the South Pacific, after all, is connected closely with developments in the North Pacific, where there is a concentration of military forces second only to that in Europe, Australia has suggested that there would be advantage in the United States and the Soviet Union initiating dialogue on their respective security perceptions and concerns in the North Pacific area. We hope that this will lead in time to the development of greater confidence and security, mutually between the super-Powers, but also among the countries of the region. Australia offers this suggestion, once again making the point that efforts to defuse the nuclear-arms issue should not be confined to those most immediately involved. Arms-control and disarmament questions ate the legitimate concern of the whole international community.
For this reason, I wish to conclude this statement by suggesting ways in which this Organization can improve its capacity to act for the international community. I do so as a representative of a country which gives way to no other country in this Hall in its support for the United Nations.
The fact is that many countries are showing a lack of confidence in the United Nations. Worse, this lack of confidence is most obvious in those countries which contribute most to the finances of the United Nations. The lesson should not be lost on us. Several factors are working to erode the credibility of this Organization. Secretariats have grown in size. Their salaries and other emoluments sometimes outstrip those enjoyed by ministers and civil servants in the countries which fund them. Committees, commissions and special conferences have proliferated, giving the United Nations the reputation in some quarters of being an ineffective talking shop.
Dr. Herbert Evatt, as Australia's Minister for External Affairs, played a notable part in the founding of the United Nations As early as 1947 he asked the General Assembly to consider whether United Nations machinery was translating into life and reality its economic and social pledges. He referred then to the risk of the United Nations becoming 'all harness and no horse'. It is essential that that question be considered anew. The Special Commission established by the Economic and Social Council provides an opportunity for Member States to examine the nature of the horse and to ensure that the harness is as effective and as light as possible. In particular, the Australian Government urges Member States to use the Special Commission to review the 280 or so bodies which have grown over the years, with a view to avoiding duplication, abolishing some bodies and amalgamating the functions of others, while preserving the machinery which works well.
Australia wishes to emphasize the point that while the cost of international organizations continues to grow at an alarming rate, many Member States, including Australia itself, face serious budgetary and adjustment problems which limit their capacity to meet such costs. Our taxpayers' enthusiasm for the burden of funding the United Nations will be strained while the impression persists that the Organization is escaping the economic discipline they and their Governments are facing.
In areas where the United Nations has shown its effectiveness, Australia has this year raised its contributions to programmes it considers have priority. I mention, for example, assistance to the United Nations Development Programme, Palestinian refugees, population programmes, control of drug abuse, the environment and international health concerns. Our contributions in these areas have been increased. But the resources Australia can provide to the United Nations are not without limit. So long as the costs to us of multilateralism continue to rise so steeply, we will have to make difficult choices; whether or not, for example, we should consider membership of all United Nations agencies.
We make that point forcefully because it is centrally important to the continued effectiveness of this Organization's capacity and even to its future, make the point in the interests of the United Nations as well as of Australians. Equally forcefully, Australia emphasizes that this in no way suggests any diminution of our commitment to United Nations ideals which, after 40 years, is as profound as ever. Mr, Evatt told the General Assembly 40 years ago that the Australian Government regarded the support of the United Nations as a cardinal principle in its foreign policy. Firm support for the multilateral system and for an effective United Nations is still a central feature of the Australian Government's foreign policy.
"
3925,42,1987,VUT,"﻿
Sir, I have the honour of extending to you the congratulations and best wishes of the Government and people of Vanuatu on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this forty-second session. Your unanimous election is both a personal tribute and a token of esteem for the country you represent. I take pleasure also in thanking your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for the manner in which he guided us during the forty-first session of the General Assembly. In addition we join in thanking the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts. His work and that of his staff and the entire Secretariat are sources of pride to us all. In this regard we commend the addition to his team of Ambassador Joseph V. Reed as Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs. He has a rather large pair of shoes to fill, but all who know him have no doubt that he is equal to the task.
Taking the floor immediately after Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, President of Zambia and current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, is a great honour and at the same time a great responsibility. It is not easy to follow to the rostrum of this body one so eloquent and so universally admired as is President Kaunda. He looms large in history as a spokesman for those who cherish mankind's highest ideals. Today he has spoken not only for the people of Zambia and the continent of Africa but also for all who believe in the United Nations.	
It is always a great honour and rare privilege to speak before the United Nations General Assembly. Today the honour is greater and the privilege later because of the presence of President Kaunda and his penetrating words. We, like others, applaud his wisdom, his dedication and his sensitivity. We also concur with his vision of a world in which humanity is permitted to blossom to its fullest potential.
The ability to communicate through the medium of the spoken or written word, so movingly demonstrated by President Kaunda today, is one of mankind's greatest achievements. Occasionally that ability is taken for granted and neither appreciated nor properly utilized.
Those few who - because of their economic or military strength - hold in their hands the power of life or death over so many other human beings, often do not feel the need to listen to those of us who do not command vast fortunes powerful armies or large armadas. When they do listen they tend to listen mechanically, with their ears rather than with their hearts. They then frequently fail to heed the poignant messages addressed to them.
Thus, year after year, speaker after speaker walks to this rostrum, stands before the nations of the world and states the case for independence for Namibia, an end to apartheid in South Africa and common decency and justice foe the Palestinians. Speaker after speaker pleads for justice and peace for the people of Central America and South-East Asia. Speaker after speaker calls for an end to the arms race and the recurring nuclear nightmares of small children everywhere. Were these words to be listened to, and heeded, they would be almost magical in what they could achieve.
Words are like magic. They can transport one to another time, another place, or another dimension. They can express the full range of human experiences and emotions, from charity to greed, from forgiveness to indignation, from humility to arrogance, from hope to despair, from love to hatred. Words can be instruments of enlightenment or revelations of ignorance. Words can stir, inspire and move listeners to action or lull them into indifference, boredom and inactivity.
Words are capable of opening minas or closing them. They are capable of expanding horizons or restricting them. They can bring us together or drive us further apart. Words are potentially more powerful than any military weapon known to mankind. They have been known to make tyrants tremble and dictatorships decay.
That is why some fear the written or spoken word as much as they fear anything. That is why eighteenth and nineteenth century slave holders in the western hemisphere made it 'illegal' for the human beings they held in bondage to learn to read and write and forbade them to communicate in their own languages. That is why well past the mid-point of the twentieth century, in even the most developed of countries, some parents have had to struggle to see their children get any semblance of a decent education. That is why the apartheid regime of South Africa has spared no effort to stifle the voices or that country's bravest sons and daughters.
That is why in so many lands, large and small, developed and Developing, north and south, east and west, so many generations of courageous human beings have pleaded, petitioned, marched and agitated for the right to be educated and the right to be heard. That is why today we search for words which will, as a renowned Mozambican poet wrote, “'... enter every house like the wind and fail like red hot embers on our people's souls
With all that words can do, none can do more than words of candour and sincerity. The late Amilcar Cabrai once encouraged his colleagues, in the African Party for the Independence of Guinea (Bissau) and Cape Verde, to hide nothing from the masses of the people and to tell no lies, claim no easy victories. That admonition is as appropriate to us here, at the United Nations today, as it was 22 years ago to those struggling to bring freedom to two small West African countries.
Truth is a mighty weapon. It is in fact the greatest weapon possessed by those who would feed the hungry, house the homeless, heal the sick, educate the illiterate, end senseless violence and generally help create a more equitable world.
In none of those areas will the international community be able to claim an easy victory; not one of these things will be easy to achieve. Then, again, that which is worth working for, that which is worth struggling for, seldom is easy. We would be guilty of the worst form of naivety were we to suggest otherwise. ,  
Words alone, no matter how beautiful, are not sufficient to resolve the hard issues on the agenda of the United Nations. If they were, Namibia would be a mil Member of the United Nations, Palestine would be a Member of the United Nations and South Africa would be represented by a legitimate Government and would be seated in this Hall today.
If words alone were sufficient/ the questions of Cyprus, Kampuchea and Afghanistan would no longer appear on our agenda. If words alone were sufficient, the peoples of Western Sahara, East Timor and New Caledonia would already have been permitted to assume their rightful places within the community of nations.
Words, however, no matter how articulate, how truthful, how forceful, now insightful or how well-intended, are never enough. They probably will never be enough. Frederick Douglas, a leader of the anti-slavery movement during the nineteenth century and a great orator, expressed that best when he said:
'Power concedes nothing without а demand. It never did and it never will.
Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.'
Every year the General Assembly passes a stream of resolutions. The words of those resolutions, taken together, comprise some of the most noble thoughts and theories known to mankind. What is far less noble is the lack of resolve by some Members of the United Nations when we leave this hall and it is time to implement our collective decisions.
It is not enough merely to denounce apartheid. It will not disappear without a struggle. How long and how violent a struggle is up to those who imposed apartheid on South Africa's people and then on Namibia. We, the rest of the world, must in a real sense support those who struggle against apartheid and adopt for ourselves values which differ from the values of those who practise this onerous creed, as well as the values of those who profit from it. The values we embrace should be the values of those who respect the genuine universality of every human being. Those values must be embraced at all times, in all places, and not merely when and where the world happens to be looking or listening.
Silence, or inaction, in the face of a known evil in one corner of the globe can be taken as acceptance of other evils in other corners of the globe. We, the international community, must be consistent and unremitting foes - no matter the price - of anyone who would assign a second- or third-class status to any person because of his or her race, religion, sex, language or economic status. 
The essential need to secure and hold the higher ground during any engagement of hostile forces is a well-known axiom of military science. In mankind's moral engagement to determine the future destiny of our planet, we should apply the same axiom and secure and maintain the higher ground.
No person held in slavery should aspire to be a slave-holder. No person who has known the bitter taste of discrimination should himself, or herself, discriminate against another. No person who has been victimized should look for others to become his, or her, victim.
It pains us deeply to see some former colonies fail to understand the legitimate strivings of others for their own independence. Interruptions in the process of decolonization are even more tragic when the intruding State is itself a former colony which might have helped a neighbour's first tentative steps on the path to reclaiming its own identity. Vanuatu's position on this question is based on what it perceives as what is right and what is wrong, rather than on what others might perceive as either convenient, expedient, safe or a fait accompli.
Thus, it is Vanuatu's hope that the people of Western Sahara, the people of East Timor and others similarly situated will be allowed to realize their dreams also. Their rights are as sacred as those of anyone else represented here today. If there is no room at the inn for them, then very few of us should feel secure about our own places.
We are similarly saddened by the tragic spectacle of intercommunal strife which plagues every corner of the earth. There is no need to recite the names, the dates or the places. Everyone is already painfully familiar with them. Much of this intercommunal strife has its roots in a shared colonial history. Some pre-dates colonialism and is the result of antagonisms that go back many centuries. Understanding the roots of a problem should help us to combat it. Unfortunately, demagogues are always willing to exploit and manipulate existing social contradictions for their own selfish ends and carry others down a destructive path. We, the international community, must maintain the higher moral ground. We should address these social contradictions and try to resolve them. How we go about it is the important question. We should let our actions signal to others the type of world we would like to see.
The dignity and majesty of the victims of the apartheid regime of South Africa are, we believe, an example for the rest of the world. The African National Council (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) have consistently maintained the higher ground by steadfastly refusing to adopt the values of the Pretoria regime. We have great faith in their vision of the future. They struggle for their people and against a system, rather than against fellow human beings. To secure the future of this planet, it rests with all of us to learn from them and stop waging war against each other and against each other's children. It rests with us not to adopt the discredited values of immoral regimes. It rests with us not to act as proxies for others who are only too willing to divide us by seductively whispering in an ear how bad one ethnic group or another is.
The tragic war between Iran and Iraq is an example of a conflict which involves a complex web of historical contradictions. Like most other countries, Vanuatu was appalled by the outbreak of this war and is appalled by its continuation, Vanuatu has never taken sides on the antagonisms that exist between these two States and will not do so now} we consider both friends. However, one must ask this; does there come a point beyond which one wages war against a neighbour and begins to wage war against one's own professed values, and one's own people, and the rest of civilization? 
We do not have-answers to the questions passed by this tragedy. Like so many others, we merely address an appeal to the decency and common sense of both parties to the conflict. We ask them please to try to reason together and arrive at some mutually agreeable formula. Let there be neither victors nor vanquished; let there simply be peace.
The war between Iran and Iraq, the loss of life it entails and its economic consequences bring to mind the relevancy of the recently concluded International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. Although the result of the Conference was not completely satisfactory, the consensus that was arrived at was an important step on the path we must all walk together. None of us can walk that or any other road alone. The economic situation faced by developing countries has been discussed at length, we will not at this time expand further on what has already been so adequately said by others similarly situated. However , we cannot help but observe that when developing countries wish to build a railroad, a port facility, an airport, a communications network, schools, health clinics or other parts of a national infrastructure all sorts of financial obstacles are encountered. But, when a developing country wishes to buy weapons, credit can always be arranged. This is true no matter how poor or how small the country, regardless of its other needs, and no matter how ill prepared its military might be to absorb certain equipment. Some seem to confuse the business of selling weapons with the art of diplomacy. For them, the way to win friends and influence people is to market the means of mass destruction. In most instances, the friends that are gained are many times fewer than those that are lost. 
The recent agreement in principle between the United States and the Soviet Union to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear forces is a positive, although tentative, step. There are, of course, a great many more complex issues to be addressed. Therefore, the proposed upcoming meeting between the leaders of those two countries is another welcome sign. President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will carry with them the prayers and hopes of the entire world when they meet. The prospect of a productive dialogue between them is a harbinger of a better international climate.
The world cannot help but be encouraged by the example of these two great nations learning to live with each other. Certainly Iran and Iraq should be able to find as much common ground as have the United States and the Soviet Union. After years of harsh and bitter fighting, it appears that common ground may now exist in another part of the world. The recently concluded agreement between five Central American Presidents is a positive step worthy of international support. Peace, and the opportunity to pursue justice without fear, may finally be at hand for the people of that troubled region.
In this connection, Vanuatu also joins in supporting appeals for the normalization of relations between Belize and Guatemala. Recognition of the national identity, dignity and territorial integrity of all six nations of Central America is an essential element in the promotion of peaceful coexistence and economic development for the people of that region.
Few areas of the world cry out as much for adherence to the basic values of human decency as does the Middle East, When all is said and done, the fact remains that in that part of the world the fundamental contradiction, the fundamental problem, the fundamental wrong, is the systematic effort to deny the humanity of the Palestinian people. Their homes, their hopes and their futures were sacrificed to establish the State of Israel. 
Now, neighbouring Lebanon faces a doubtful future. Its children's dreams have also been sacrificed. Is there no limit to what the world expects the people of that region to endure? This is a matter that has vexed and plagued the international community for longer than anyone cares to remember. Over the years, there have been a great many heroes and civilians on both sides. Certainly, neither side is pure but, here again, each must reach out to the other. It makes as much sense today to ignore the Palestine Liberation Organization as it did earlier to attempt to deny the existence of the people it represents. This is a problem that the international community helped to create. Thus, it is a matter that we must help to resolve. We can begin by convening the much discussed international conference on the Middle East.
William Shakespeare once aptly stated that the past is the prologue. We believe that solutions to many of the items on the agenda of the United Nations require that we look to the future rather than be prisoners of the past. Today the United Nations affords mankind an opportunity to avoid many of yesterday's mistakes.
However, like Shakespeare, we believe that truly to comprehend the nature of some of the current problems and the motivation of some of the principal actors on the world stage, we must also have knowledge of the past. In this regard we note regrettably that some, notably the apartheid regime of South Africa, live so far in the past that they are incapable of comprehending the lessons of history.
South Africa's slave-State conditions are not historically unique. In recent years those conditions have been modified in form but not in substance. Thus, South Africa remains fundamentally as uncompromisingly racist as other parts of the world were in the nineteenth century.
The changes that have occurred resulted in part from the impact of the rapidly changing world of the twentieth century. However, the most important catalyst has been, and continues to be, the efforts of the people of South Africa who have simply refused to be docile.
Apartheid ranks with slavery, the inhuman excesses of the colonial era, the holocaust of the Second World War era and other acts of genocide, among the most significant crimes ever committed against humanity. Apartheid is not always discussed in the same context as slavery. However, for many reasons we believe it should be. The commercial traffic in human beings known as the trans-Atlantic slave trade, like its lesser known counterpart in the South Pacific, earned universal condemnation for its evil nature and the horror it created. That sinful behaviour cost millions of lives and destroyed entire societies. It wrenched families apart and eventually became the genesis of colonialism. The depth and magnitude of the human suffering caused by the slave trade is incalculable. Similarly, the financial wealth accumulated by an assortment of kidnappers, hijackers, thugs and terrorists - yes, terrorists - as a result of the traffic in human beings can never be calculated. Some may have forgotten. Others, no doubt, would prefer to forget this important page of history.
We make this reference today not out of bitterness. There is no rancour in our hearts and no recrimination is intended. We merely wish every nation represented here today to remember and comprehend the past so that we will understand the true context of South Africa, the nature of Humanity's foe in Pretoria and what the international community must do to overcome that for. South Africa has not yet learned the lessons of history. Therefore the rest of the world must strive harder to bring the message of those lessons home to South Africa. We must become better interpreters and instructors of history than we have been to date.
Despite circumstances and conditions which would test the patience of a saint. Nelson Mandela has maintained the moral higher ground we spoke of earlier. He and his colleagues have taught their gaolers a most important lesson. Indeed, in a sense, he and many of his people are freer than those who placed him in prison and who fearfully stand guard over an entire aroused nation. It is our hope that by the end of this session of the general Assembly all of us will be standing with Mr. Mandela and no one will either apologize for, or protect, his gaolers. Those who traffic in narcotic drugs have much in common with those who now govern South Africa. Both value material wealth over human life and moral decency. Both sell the false dream of a mindless form of existence. Both offer nothing more than modern-day slavery in different forms. Both deserve nothing but the sternest concerted international action to eradicate them from the human experience.
The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking held in Vienna this past June under the able presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, was an important milestone. Vanuatu is pleased to note the Increasing International realization that not a single region, not a single nation, not a single community, not a single individual is untouched, or immune, from the scourge of drug abuse or the curse of drug traffickers and what they bring with them. However, no nation, not even the richest and most powerful among us, can feel that it is doing enough to address this major challenge to civilization. The evidence of this fact surrounds us, unfortunately, and threatens to drown us all.
Terrorism also threatens to drown civilization. This is as true of the type of terrorism practised by those who appear at a door in the middle of the night wearing official uniforms, armed with the blessings of a State apparatus and who have perfected techniques of torture, as it is of those individuals who take it upon themselves to kidnap and cruelly traffic in human beings much as slave traders and pirates did in an earlier era. It is also as true of the type of terrorism that holds all of humanity captive to the very real danger posed by nuclear arsenals, as it is of those who commit random acts of violence using more conventional Instruments of death. Terrorism is wrong. It is wrong morally. It is wrong tactically. It is wrong politically. There are not exceptions and no qualifying conditions. One cannot use criminal tactics without becoming a criminal. 
The values of an organization or a movement are, like the values of an individual, determined by how that organization or movement lives and how it values life - all life. That is true whether the life being valued is that of one who is black, white, brown or yellow; whether it is the life of one who is Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, atheist or agnostic; whether it is the life of one who is gifted or disabled; or whether it is the life of one who is wealthy or one who lives in poverty.
We now turn to a subject we wish we did not have to turn to. In the forty-second year of the existence of the United Nations, 27 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, this body should not still have before it the question of Namibia or the question of New Caledonia.
Despite the obvious obstacles to its independence, there is no longer any question as to whether Namibia's people have the right to their own identity and their own country. Even if South Africa were tomorrow somehow to transfer large numbers of whites into Namibia - many of them military personnel and civil servants - and enough people from neighbouring countries to make the Namibians a minority in their own country, no one would be deceived and question Namibia's right to become an independent nation. South Africa, by its intransigence, has managed to delay the inevitable, but it cannot at this stage rewrite history.
In New Caledonia, the administering Power is attempting to defraud the colonized people and deceive the international community through a policy of demographic engineering. Through its deliberate actions in encouraging migration to New Caledonia, it has now succeeded in turning that Territory's people into a minority - although still the largest community numerically - in their own land. The question before us now is, should such actions by a colonial Power be allowed to frustrate the legitimate aspirations of a colonized people and a decision of the United Nations? Common sense and morality, as well as the Charter and many pronouncements of the United Nations, clearly indicate that the answer is
The Government of Vanuatu wishes to make it clear once again that it has no quarrel with the Government or people of Prance. It wishes Prance, and the people of that great nation, nothing but continued prosperity and success. These wishes are sincere and earnest. They are not, however, given at the expense of the people of New Caledonia or those of any other territory whose lands and resources may be coveted by a segment of the French population.
Vanuatu is New Caledonia's closest neighbour. It is also a country that has a shared colonial history with that of New Caledonia and an affinity for its people that can perhaps only be understood by other peoples who also have so much in common, Last year we, and other countries of the South Pacific were gratified by the support we received on the question of New Caledonia at the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held at Harare, Zimbabwe. We are further pleased that today, New Caledonia's colonized people continue to enjoy the support of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in their campaign to regain that which they never surrendered.
We were also gratified by the decision taken by the General Assembly last December to place New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Delegations may recall the atmosphere in the General Assembly in the days leading up to that decision and on the particular day the vote was taken. Delegations may also recall the things that were said and the way in which they were said.
Some were told that New Caledonia was a part of Prance and that this matter had no business being discussed at the United Nations. Some were told that what became resolution 41/41 A was unnecessary because the Committee of 24 was going to consider the question anyway. Some were told that the countries of the South Pacific harboured irrational ill feelings towards France and did not know what they were doing. That last statement was the most incredulous of the many incredulous things that were said.
Looking back one must wonder, if Prance was so convinced that New Caledonia was a part of France, why it conducted what it termed a referendum on the Territory's future only a few weeks ago. We will not even pose the question how and when New Caledonia became a 'part' of France. We will save that question for another day.
One must also wonder why if resolution 41/41 A was so unnecessary, France still has not transmitted the information required of it under Article 73e of the Charter. On the basis of the arguments it put forward last year# one might have surmised that France intended to co-operate with the Committee of 24. Instead, the only information that has been forthcoming is the rather inaccurate statement made by the Foreign Minister of France in his address to the Assembly on 23 September 1987. With all due respect to the Foreign Minister, we do not consider a plebiscite organized without due regard for the accepted principles and practices of the United Nations to be a valid act of self-determination. This is particularly true when the colonized people boycott the entire process.
The result was predictable, and was predicted. Those who are French chose to remain French. We would have expected nothing else. For the most part, those who are not French did not vote.
Is France now proposing that similar votes be organized in other areas under occupation? Could such a plebiscite turn the Golan Heights, for example, into part of Israel? By extension of this logic, might we permit South Africa to further its claim to an important part of Namibia through a little demographic engineering? In a somewhat similar vein, are we now prepared to accept France's claim to Mayotte? In the future, will we accept any large country's claim to a smaller, less populous land, simply because its people are overwhelmed numerically and, most important, militarily?	.
This is the way the world operated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and in the early part of this century before there was a United Nations Is this what we wish to return to? What France is now telling the world flies in the face of logic and United Nations precedent. It is also a radical departure from the currently accepted norm of international behaviour, and a very dangerous departure from the accepted practice of decolonization. Furthermore, we do not agree with the Foreign Minister's statement that conditions in New Caledonia during the plebiscite, '... were calm and beyond dispute' (A/42/PV.8, ρ 36). Through the eyes of television cameras, the world saw how 'calm' things were in New Caledonia in the weeks leading up to the vote. We are as pleased as anyone that there was not more violence. However, we attribute this to the patience of the Kanak people and the intimidating presence of French military forces, which controlled the colonized population very effectively. The French military did its job very well.
Now we, the international community, have our own mission to perform. We must continue to follow the principles and practices we established. We must continue to be faithful to our Charter and to our own histories.
The Committee of 24 has recommended a draft resolution which does exactly that. It is balanced and moderate in tone. We hope members will lend their support to this draft and thereby remain faithful to the United Nations' own stated values. We merely ask that the United Nations be allowed to play its customary role. What could be more reasonable?
Prance is an important member of this body. It occupies a permanent seat on the Security Council and in other ways exercises considerable influence within and without the Organization, It should, therefore, be among the first to respect the letter and the spirit of the decisions of the world body. Being fair to those who have been colonized in New Caledonia can only enhance, rather than diminish, the prestige and glory of France.
We will continue to make this appeal until it is heard by France with its heart, as well as with its ears. If it is ignored, we will continue until it is heeded. Nothing will dissuade Vanuatu from this cause, other than the Kanak people themselves saying that this is no longer their cause. Vanuatu has no ulterior motive in pressing this case. We have nothing to hide, and nothing to gain, save security in the knowledge that the United Nations is still the Organization that the words of its Charter recite.
"
3967,42,1987,NZL,"﻿To the representatives of the countries of the world - greetings. Bring to us from your home countries the gifts we can all share, your words of wisdom and your love. I am very happy that we have all arrived here at this gathering of world leaders. 
On behalf of New Zealand I add my congratulations, sir, to those of the many speakers who have preceded me on your election as President of the forty-second regular session of the General Assembly.
Seven weeks ago the New Zealand Labour Government was re-elected with an increased majority. The Government was greatly encouraged by that demonstration of support from the people of our country for the policies we have pursued at home and overseas. My address today provides an opportunity for me to reaffirm the commitment of the New Zealand Government and people to the United Nations. That commitment comes from 42 years of membership of the Organization, from active participation in its work and from New Zealand's firm adherence to its ideals.
In this spirit of steadfast support for the United Nations I am happy to be able to announce here that the New Zealand Government has recently reviewed its capacity to contribute to United Nations peace-keeping operations. As a result, we have decided to notify the Secretary-General of our willingness to expand our practical contribution to that most important part of the United Nations work. We have participated in United Nations peace-keeping operations in the past. At present, we provide personnel for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and we contribute financially to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In future, we anticipate giving favourable consideration to requests from the Secretary-General for future involvement of New Zealand forces in peace-keeping for the United Nations. In our case, that would probably, for example, take the form of specialist teams from the New Zealand armed forces. Our broad purpose in making this commitment is to demonstrate active, practical support ; for the United Nations role of strengthening and monitoring international peace and security. 
Fundamentally the job of the United Nations is to preserve peace. That was why it was founded 42 years ago. That is why it remains so important in the world today· And in today's world that means that this Organization must address clearly and critically the overriding threat to international peace and security posed by the global arms race, and in particular the nuclear-arms race.
New Zealand's first priority in this Assembly is to work for the achievement of urgent reductions in nuclear weapons. The ultimate goal must be a world rid of nuclear weapons; a world in which no country can claim to have to rely on nuclear weapons as the guarantor of its security.
New Zealand has been greatly encouraged by recent developments in relations between the two super-Powers. Along with all other nations we welcomed their decision to agree in principle to scrap an entire class of nuclear weapons - the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) stationed in Europe and Asia. If that agreement in principle is followed, as it must be, by a treaty giving legal force to the political commitments made in Washington, it will mark a turning-point in the arms race. The INF agreement will be the first ever nuclear-arms reduction treaty. It will be testimony to the conviction that security can be maintained with fewer, not more, armaments, and that an increasing number of weapons is not necessary to preserve the peace.
An INF agreement will be a welcome first step. But it is only a first step. It must be followed by measures to bring about deep reductions in strategic nuclear weapons, and by measures to prevent an arms race in outer space. Moreover, if progress is to be made on those two fronts, it will be necessary to address as a matter of priority the perceived imbalance in conventional forces and thus to achieve a balance of such forces at significantly reduced levels.
President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev have themselves pointed the way. At Reykjavik last year they showed that there is no disagreement on the goals that must be achieved: a 50-per-cent reduction in strategic nuclear arsenals and, ultimately, the complete elimination o£ nuclear weapons. We urge them not to turn away from those objectives, not to turn away from the vision we saw from Reykjavik of a world without nuclear weapons. That vision will not be realized this year, perhaps not even this century. Yet it is an objective in the achievement of which every country in the Assembly has a direct and vital interest.
The immediate challenge is to find ways of working towards that goal while at the same time maintaining the security of every State and region.
New Zealand has long held that concluding a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is one important way to do that. In the resolutions that we, together with Australia and a number of other countries, have put before the Assembly, we have urged the international community to seize on the central means of putting a brake on the nuclear-arms race. While we have welcomed, therefore, the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to begin stage-by stage negotiations on nuclear testing, we would nevertheless still urge the participants to see that those negotiations are more closely linked to the objective the Assembly has reiterated for so many years - an end to all nuclear testing by all States in all environments for all time. 
We will again be putting a resolution on nuclear testing before the First Committee of the Assembly. We will be calling on the Conference on Disarmament to break the impasse which has strangled effective multilateral consideration of this issue for the past five years.
Another issue which the multilateral disarmament process has so far failed to address adequately is the prevention of an arms race in outer space. Three years ago my Prime Minister David Lange noted from this rostrum the disquieting indications that the military competition between the two super-Powers might be moving into the new environment of outer space. Developments since that time have done little to allay our concern. New Zealand is unequivocally opposed to the extension of the arms race into outer space. We will be following closely the deliberations at the Conference on Disarmament on this subject next year and at the third special session of this Assembly on disarmament, where it can be expected to receive considerable attention.
However, there have been some notable achievements this year. Progress has been made at the Geneva negotiations on a convention to eliminate chemical weapons - some of the most barbaric instruments of war, the use of which we unequivocally condemn. We look forward to the early completion of that most urgent work. In addition, the successful conclusion o£ the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development, which I was privileged to address just over a month ago, should have restored some faith in multilateralism. The consensus achieved at that Conference is all the more significant when considered against the pessimism that marked its preparatory process. It should encourage us as we prepare for the third special session on disarmament next year. 
As a smaller nation with little power to influence the great nuclear-weapon States, We simply make a plea, an impassioned plea, to our brothers and sisters that have that power. We are now at a historic turning-point in the modern era. Having gone steadily forward in preparation for defence or conflict since men first formed groups and alliances, we have come to the brink. We, most of us, want to turn back. But there are still abroad fears that those whom we have not learned to knew or to trust will keep pressing ahead, that to proceed with disarming will undermine our own security. Learning to trust each other enough, learning to tone down the rhetoric we use against each other/ is now fundamental to the steps we need to take to enable this small, delicate planet and its people to survive.
That is why my country is so determined to see progress towards disarmament. The stakes are enormous. While the arms race continues in its nuclear and conventional dimensions, the security of each of us is at risk. New Zealanders do not expect others to act while we do nothing ourselves. Equally, we do not tell others how to resolve the particular security imperatives of their region as they seek to give substance to the principles of the Charter and to the international community's desire for a safer, less militarised world.
At home my Government has enacted legislation to ensure that New Zealand remains nuclear free. With our partners in the South Pacific Forum we have made a contribution to the security of our region through the adoption and entry into force of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. That Treaty reinforces the non-proliferation undertakings already given by nearly all Forum countries through our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It gives expression to the unanimous desire of all the independent and self-governing States of our region that our part of the world should not be used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons or a dumping ground for nuclear waste. For the zone established by the Treaty to be truly effective, however, we rely on the nuclear-weapon States to commit themselves unreservedly to respecting its provisions. It is our earnest hope that all five nuclear—weapon States will demonstrate respect for the wishes of South Pacific States by adhering to the protocols to the Treaty. It is our particular hope that France will demonstrate its understanding of the sensitivities of our region, the region in which it seeks to be a partner, by putting an end to its nuclear-testing programme in the South Pacific.
The control and reduction of armaments may help to maintain international security. It is the use of arms that destroys it. The Charter accordingly imposes an obligation on all States to settle their differences by negotiation and not to go to war. In the Security Council the Charter created the means by which the United Nations could uphold the rule of law and work for the peaceful settlement of disputes and the ending of conflict. The Council's record is far from unblemished we believe that its performance could be improved if its members could co-operate to settle disputes before the parties turn to conflict and its decisions might be less often disregarded or defied if the policies and actions of the great Powers showed greater respect for the laws they enjoin others to follow.
New Zealand welcomes the rare unanimous decision by the Security Council to seek an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. We regret only that the conflict was allowed to continue for seven years before the Council intervened to fulfil the role assigned to it by the Charter. The Secretary-General may be assured of our full support in his patient efforts, on behalf of the Council and with the trust of both parties, to settle the conflict in accordance with resolution 598 (1987). It is to his office, too, that we look for assistance in ending the aggression against the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea, which has continued year after year regardless of the wishes and condemnation of the General Assembly. Political settlements in both countries and the withdrawal of foreign forces from them are long overdue. In Korea, the armed confrontation still continues after more than three decades. The absence of Korean representation is a major gap in the universality of the United Nations. New Zealand shares the widespread view that the two Koreas should be admitted as Members of the United Nations as soon as possible and should pursue their negotiations towards reconciliation and, if possible, national reunification.
Pew situations have preoccupied the United Nations longer than the South African Government's racist practices, its illegal occupation of Namibia and its policies of destabilization in the region. Like those of the Commonwealth Group which last year sought to initiate a dialogue between the Government and genuine representatives of the black community, mediation efforts by the United Nations have come to nothing. The South African Government equates justice with white supremacy and right with the forces at its disposal. Its armies have marched in territories of neighbouring States. Its police have detained both black leaders and children looking for something better than education for a life of subjection. For our part we have given effect to the measures against South Africa recommended by the Commonwealth to impress on the authorities in Pretoria the urgency of dismantling apartheid. But, sadly, I have to say that, in the absence of effective action by more countries or a firm response to the threat by the Security Council, I see little prospect that the South African Government will depart from its determination not to reject apartheid, but to tinker with it, at its own pace and in its own time.
Apartheid is a most brutal manifestation of racism and disregard of human rights. It is not, however, the only such manifestation. We all know too well the many abuses of human rights that occur in various countries represented in this body. The United Nations has done much valuable work in codifying universal standards of respect for human rights. We must ensure that this work continues and that the standards already set are fully respected.
Abuses of human rights are a direct attack on the integrity of the individual. Terrorism strikes at the integrity of the community. It kills the innocent and cruelly disrupts the normal operations of society. It is also a threat to world peace. An important task at this session will be to build on the achievement of resolution 40/61 and thereby encourage the adoption of practical measures to deal with international terrorism. Another item of importance to New Zealand is that on Antarctica, an issue that has been on the Assembly's agenda since 1983. New Zealand is firmly committed to maintaining the Antarctic Treaty which has preserved the peace and stability of the region to our south over the past 27 years. We hope that the Assembly's deliberations on Antarctica at this session will bring further understanding and support for the Treaty, which any Member of the Organization is free to join.
Events in Fiji show that the South Pacific is not immune from turmoil or change. For New Zealand - a close friend and neighbour - these events have been a matter of very great sadness. Since the time of the first coup New Zealand has steadfastly supported the efforts of Fiji's Governor-General to return the country to parliamentary rule·, we continue to regard him as the legitimate source of authority in Fiji. It follows that New Zealand does not recognize the legality of Colonel Rabuka's self-declared republic. Even at this late stage we hope that the people of Fiji will pull back and insist that their leaders find a just political solution which takes account of the interests of all. New Zealand trusts that the Governor-General will hold fast to the principles of legitimacy which have guided him thus far. We very much hope that no constitution will be adopted that would make Fiji Indians second class citizens in their own country. We want to see Fiji regain its rightful position in the Pacific region and on the wider world stage. Like all its neighbours New Zealand wants to see Fiji strengthened by a reassertion of its traditions of tolerance and good sense, playing an active part in the peaceful development of the South Pacific. Failure to achieve a solution would be a major set-back, not only for Fiji but for the entire South Pacific region.
Fiji's crisis is a recent development. We have, however, been concerned for some time at the dangers inherent in the situation in our closest neighbour New Caledonia if the natural progress of that Territory to self-determination is frustrated. At the initiative of the countries of the South Pacific Forum, the General Assembly last year resolved that New Caledonia was a Non-Self-Governing Territory within the meaning of the United Nations Charter. Forum countries sought to have New Caledonia re-inscribed on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories because of their wish to see a more constructive approach by the administering Power. Present policies serve to exacerbate divisions within the Territory and appear likely to frustrate movement towards independence.
My Government believes that France has a continuing role to play in the South Pacific region. But that will require a far-sighted approach to resolving the problems of New Caledonia and a sensitivity to the views and feelings of the peoples of the region. We have watched with genuine regret what has appeared to us to be a policy that does not take sufficient account of long-term concerns and solutions, bringing with it the prospect of more confrontation and division within New Caledonia.
Since last year's vote, France has promoted a referendum in New Caledonia, an exercise which in our view has not helped the political process there and about which, as we know from the debate which surrounded the passage of the referendum legislation through the French Parliament earlier this year, there are considerable doubts in France itself. A referendum which did not offer the full range of choices prescribed by United Nations practices and guidelines is deficient. It cannot be regarded as a free choice when the administering Power is committed to promoting one particular choice and the forces of government are directed to that end. A process of preparation during which options were not fully presented and were not adequately explained is a further serious deficiency. A period of preparation in which there was only circumscribed dialogue within the Territory and throughout which there was a strong military presence, is no atmosphere for free and impartial consideration of New Caledonia's long-term future. In short, a political consultation that forced a substantial sector of the community to repudiate the very process, is inherently flawed. It is not a valid act of s el f -determination.
I appeal to the French Government to resume contact with all interested parties in New Caledonia, to accept the offer of dialogue which the South Pacific Forum has made and to involve the United Nations in the political process that is to take place in New Caledonia.
Elsewhere in the South Pacific the United Nations has played a valuable role in the decolonization process as Non-Self-Governing Territories have moved to self-government or to independence in accordance with United Nations principles and practices. For this reason my Government urges strong support for the moderate, principled and constructive resolution on New Caledonia which will be taken up in the Fourth Committee at this session of the Assembly.
For the most part the decolonization process in the Pacific has been peaceful and has laid the basis for good regional co-operation. That tradition has been continued this year with the proclamation of the Compacts of Free Association of ' the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. New Zealand welcomes them as new members of the South Pacific Forum. We look forward to increasing contacts with the Micronesian Governments in the years to come and to the fulfilment of the United Nations role in the Trust Territory of the Pacific.
Political security must be reinforced by economic security. Not only in the South Pacific, but throughout the world, the effect of low commodity prices is having a serious effect. Growth in developing countries is expected to average only 4 per cent in 1987, half the average of the 1960s and 1970s. Hardest hit is the agricultural sector which, in low-income developing countries, employs 70 to 80 per cent of the population.
Yet the undisciplined nature of world agricultural trade means that countries with a comparative advantage in agriculture have to compete for markets with subsidized exports that distort prices. The twin spectres of surpluses and starvation are an economic and moral outrage that cannot be allowed to continue  a contradiction which we must find ways to remove.
At its seventh session, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development noted that while many countries, developed and developing, are adjusting their economies, much remained to be done to reduce or eliminate 'growth retarding distortions and rigidities'. The positive forward-thinking spirit that marked that session should guide us in our efforts towards the elimination of trade-distorting measures. Crucial to these efforts are the negotiations currently under way in the Uruguay round. If we really believe in having a healthy international economy, contributing to world peace, we must ensure that these negotiations succeed.
As we work to improve the functioning of the system of international relations we must also work to improve the functioning of the institution that underpins so much of the system. Last year's financial crisis made clear that we, the membership, had failed to ensure that this Organization remained responsive to changing demands and circumstances. The financial crisis itself was precipitated by a failure on the part of some of the Members to fulfil their Charter commitments. It served to highlight, however, a more long-standing failure of the collective membership and of the institution to ensure the continuing revitalization of the Organization.	.
Every institution, no matter how noble its goals, needs to undertake from time to time a thorough-going reappraisal of its structures and procedures. In recognition of this need, for instance, my Government is in the process of carrying out a far-reaching reform of the functioning of government in New Zealand. The United Nations is no different. It needs to change with the times.
From the work of the past year a number of studies and reforms are under way. They must be pursued to their conclusion. The financial crisis may have abated to a degree: the need for change has not. One of the areas to which my Government will pay particular attention is the review of management of the United Nations development effort to be undertaken by the Economic and Social Council over the next year. The United Nations and its agencies have a unique role to play in development assistance, particularly in areas such as the establishment of development planning mechanisms and negotiations by Governments with trans national corporations. But such assistance must be appropriate and effective. The special needs of the isolated island developing nations of the South Pacific are often inadequately met by structures and rules which have been set up to cover large continental recipients in other regions. Any decisions taken on the spot in the South Pacific by a more coherent United Nations presence would reflect more truly the South Pacific realities than decisions taken in places such as Geneva, New York or Bangkok. 
I offer those remarks not as the representative of a country that is critical of or disenchanted with the United Nations. Quite the reverse: as 1 said at the beginning, the New Zealand Government and people are firm supporters of the United Nations. We shall remain so. But we would be bad friends of the Organization if we failed to encourage it to change where change is necessary. The process of change is under way. Let us keep up the momentum, and let us get the balance right. I end as I began, drawing on the wisdom of the Maori people of New Zealand. There is a Maori saying which goes,
'A warrior who works hard at growing food will not fail'.
That expresses in a nutshell what this Organization is all about. We must be firm in our resolve to retain the peace, but must look also to improving the lot of all our peoples. Getting the balance right is an international imperative.
"
4013,37,1982,AUS,"On behalf of the Aus¬tralian Government, Sir, I 
congratulate you on your election to the 
presidency of the thirty seventh sessions of the 
General Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure 
to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General, who 
has shown great imagination and integrity in his 
first year in office.
98.	No one can ignore the somber mood of the 
Assembly as it faces the critical issues of the 
day, particularly the terrible events of three 
weeks ago in Lebanon. Even in a world used to 
acts of violence, the Beirut massacres have 
numbed and shocked us all Outrage, however 
strongly worded and deeply felt, must appear 
inadequate to innocent non-com¬batants whose 
unhappy history has been written in blood and 
tears. Australians share the view of civilized 
men and women everywhere on the need for, and 
welcome, a full and independent inquiry into 
these appalling events.
99.	Beyond Beirut, however, there is a wider 
tragedy of 30 years and more of the Middle East 
conflict that inexcusably still defies resolution 
and clouds the future of the region. One can only 
hope that the events in Beirut will shock more 
countries into a realization of the need for a 
comprehensive settlement.
100.	Australia has always been deeply 
conscious of the age-long suffering of the Jewish 
people and their right to a homeland. We 
understand Israel's concern that it be able to 
live in peace, free of terrorist attacks. 
Recognition of Israel's right to exist in peace 
can, however, settle only one side of the Middle 
East problem. Israel must also recognize the 
legitimate rights of the Palestinians, rights 
which should include a homeland for the 
Palestinians alongside Israel. Israel, 
pre-eminently among nations, should understand 
the significance of a national homeland for a 
dispersed people.
101.	Equally important is the need for 
movement from the Arab side. We recognize that 
the proposals from the Twelfth Arab Summit 
Conference at Fez provided an implicit 
recognition of Israel by calling for the Security 
Council to guarantee peace among all States of 
the region. Why, however, cannot the implicit be 
made explicit? All Arab nations should clearly 
accept what so far Egypt alone has accepted, 
namely, that Israel has a right to exist in peace 
and security behind stable borders.
102.	So the problem has two aspects. It will 
need courage and imagination on both sides to 
deal with it. Otherwise there will be no peace in 
the Middle East— and the Middle East without 
peace will remain a threat to the peace of the 
world.
103.	The Middle East is only one area of 
conflict. Other crises in other areas seem to 
arise with fright¬ening frequency. It is only too 
apparent that the international machinery 
developed here in New York to contain and settle 
conflicts has not been working as it should. The 
fact is that some Member States, including 
Australia, have had to go outside the United 
Nations framework for alternative peace-keeping 
arrangements. Examples are the Sinai 
Multinational Force and Observers, in which 
Australia is a par¬ticipant, and the current 
international force in Lebanon.
104.	In an unusually candid report on the 
state bf the United Nations, the 
Secretary-General has this year set out the 
concerns so many of us feel about the present 
weaknesses in the Organization. We commend him 
for doing so. The recent record is dismal. As the 
Secretary-General has observed, we are perilously 
near to a new international anarchy.
103. The Security Council, the primary organ for 
the maintenance of international peace and 
security, finds its resolutions routinely 
ignored. Those provi¬sions of the Charter dealing 
with collective action for peace and security 
have been rendered ineffective. Too often Member 
States have contrived to avoid bringing 
particular problems to the Security Council, or 
to do so too late for the Council to have any 
effective impact. Distressingly, for many Member 
States, the Council's writ hardly runs at all. 
And what applies to the Security Council applies 
even more in the General Assembly and other 
organs of the United Nations.
106. All that, as the Secretary-General has aptly 
observed, amounts to a crisis in the multilateral 
approach to resolving world problems, and to a 
crisis of confidence in the United Nations 
itself. But we must not be overawed by the 
problems. Their effects can be moderated if not 
overcome. The Secretary- General himself has 
proposed a number of measures which could improve 
the situation. Some of his propo¬sals, moreover, 
could be realized immediately. That is the case, 
for example, with his concern that there should 
be more systematic use of the Security Council. 
There is clearly a role for the Secretary-General 
himself, acting within the terms of Article 99 of 
the Charter, to bring potentially dangerous 
situations to the attention of the Security 
Council. The Council itself should be able to 
move more promptly into a dispute without, as the 
Secretary-General says, waiting for those 
directly involved to bring the dispute to its 
atten¬tion. The Council and the Secretary-General 
acting together could do much to defuse 
smouldering conflicts through, for example, the 
early dispatch of fact-finding and good offices 
missions. Such measures could con¬stitute a 
diplomatic early warning system  designed to 
identify and isolate disputes before they 
degenerate into armed conflict.
107. The Secretary-General has gone further; he 
has urged the need for improving the collective 
security provisions of the Charter provided under 
Chapter VII. Specifically he has proposed—and 
Australia supports him—that Member States should 
use their collective influence to ensure respect 
for decisions of the Security Council. In an 
ideal situation Security Council peace¬keeping 
orders would be backed up by guarantees of 
collective action, including guarantees by the 
per¬manent members, to ensure compliance with all 
deci¬sions of the Council.
108. We recognize that these constructive ideas 
of the Secretary-General will be the subject of 
intensive scrutiny. They presuppose, as he says, 
at least a modicum of co-operation among the 
permanent members. It is the lack of that 
co-operation in the past which has so often 
frustrated the work of the Council. But some such 
evolution along the lines the Secretary-General 
has outlined is essential if the present drift is 
to be arrested.
109. Not that the recent record has been all bad; 
we should recall and reflect upon some of the 
signifi¬cant achievements of the United Nations. 
One notable example is decolonization. The 
Organization has made it possible for very many 
peoples to attain indepen¬dence and thereby make 
their own contribution to the international 
community.
110. There are today very few situations where 
non-self-governing peoples have yet to exercise 
their right of self-determination. Namibia, 
however, remains on the agenda. The 
Secretary-General in his report on the work of 
the Organization reflects a sense of cautious 
optimism about Namibia. Let us hope that that 
optimism is well placed. A peaceful solution to 
this long-standing problem would clearly be a 
very great achievement, if such a solution is 
worked out, it will owe much to the persistent 
efforts of the contact group and the front-line 
States. Australia continues to stand ready to 
contribute an engineering and head¬quarters unit 
of about 300 men to UNTAG to help oversee and 
supervise the independence process.
111.	Decolonization is not the only area of 
United Nations success. There have been, and 
continue to be, considerable achievements in the 
economic, social and technical fields—so much so 
perhaps that we sometimes take these achievements 
for granted. As a clearing-house for ideas and as 
an instrument for technical assistance and 
co-operation, the United Nations and its agencies 
have fulfilled a unique and valuable role.
112.	In the North-South area, too, there has 
been progress, although we have not yet achieved 
our ultimate goals. Australia shares what I take 
to be the general sense of disappointment at the 
failure thus fhr to launch global negotiations. 
We also share in the concern, so evident at the 
recent meetings of IMF and World Bank in Toronto, 
about what thefuture holds. Finding durable 
solutions to the financial and economic problems 
besetting the world has never been more urgent.
113.	One major issue rightly causing growing 
con¬cern is the extent of the world's 
indebtedness. A par¬ticularly disturbing aspect 
is the concentration in areas with limited 
ability to service and repay bor¬rowings, the 
cost of which has in some cases tripled since the 
time of the original loan.
114.	Australia wants a break in the impasse in 
the North-South dialogue. There is a need to 
galvanize the kind of political will evident at 
the Common¬wealth Heads of Government Meeting at 
Melbourne in September/October 1981, and at the 
International Meeting on Co-operation and 
Development, at Cancun in October 1981. In both 
cases it was shown to be possible to break across 
traditional North- South lines. Australia accepts 
the North-South frame¬work, and the developing 
country Group of 77 as a valid negotiating 
partner. But we also see merit in more flexible 
and open contacts across North-South lines as a 
means of bridging differences.
115.	The benefits of such an approach were 
demon¬strated in the recent law of the sea 
negotiations. It was a remarkable achievement for 
a Conference of ISO countries to draft and reach 
consensus on hun¬dreds of articles of new 
international treaty law. While the Convention on 
the Law of the Sea perhaps never could have been 
entirely satisfactory to all parties, it 
represents a major step forward in the 
codification of maritime law and in co-operation 
between nations. This experience shows that we 
must not relax efforts to tackle the seemingly 
insoluble as well as the apparently soluble.
116.	Among present international economic 
prob¬lems none concerns the Australian Government 
more than protectionism and restraints on trade. 
Australia is acutely aware of the obstacles to 
progress and of the entrenched national interest 
and rigidities which have to be overcome. The 
Australian Government has promoted the concept of 
collective reduction of protectionism by 
Governments aimed at providing a stimulus to 
world trade. The Australian proposal involves a 
standstill on all trade-distorting assistance 
measures and, following the standstill, a gradual 
wind-back of this assistance. We intend to pursue 
these proposals vigorously at the forthcoming 
GATT ministerial meeting and afterwards at the 
sixth session of UNCTAD.
117.	What distinguishes the Australian 
approach is that we are ready to commit ourselves 
to action along these lines—provided that other 
comparable countries do likewise. In other words, 
the Australian Government, having considered the 
matter, has already taken the decision that, if 
the other major trading nations were to apply the 
approach we have outlined, or to attempt 
something like it, we would immediately join it.
118.	It follows from what I have said that 
this is an area which must be addressed 
multilateral^ and in which States will inevitably 
be looking to progressive, balanced global 
reductions in trade barriers, export subsidies 
and other trade-distorting measures as a 
condition of their own participation. It is a 
further rationale for getting on with global 
negotiations.
119.	Now is not the time for a detailed 
analysis of the present difficulties in launching 
global negotia¬tions, but a basis emerged from 
the Versailles Eco¬nomic Summit. I interpreted 
the Versailles language to mean: here is an 
opportunity to launch global negotiations now. If 
it is rejected, I believe it could be some time 
before we get another chance. Indeed, if the 
debate is allowed to drift again into the details 
of what groups should be constituted here to 
handle the talks, and thus what the agenda and 
degree of decentralization should be, this will 
amount to turning the clock back to a much 
earlier and more difficult phase in the 
discussions.
120.	As in the North-South so in the 
humanitarian area the United Nations has an 
important role to play. Here it can point to a 
number of significant achievements. In some cases 
results have been attained only after arduous and 
lengthy negotiations. This has often obscured the 
significance of the ultimate result.
121.	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
of 1948 and the two International Covenants on 
Human Rights provide the world community with a 
set of standards for the protection of 
fundamental rights and freedoms. The adoption by 
the General Assembly of the Declaration on the 
Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief is a 
further step along this road. Working through the 
Commission on Human Rights, ILO and other 
relevant bodies, the United Nations system has 
been able significantly to mitigate some of the 
worst breaches of human rights. Human rights in 
South Africa and countries such as Poland, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and Guatemala have come 
under increasing scrutiny. Australia will remain 
active in these important areas.
122.	Meanwhile, new areas of humanitarian 
concern are being considered. We have 
particularly welcomed the recent emphasis on the 
protection of indigenous populations. Australia 
was active in encouraging the establishment by 
the Economic and Social Council this year of a 
working group on indigenous populations.
123.	Yet another area, regrettably, of 
increasing concern is the plight of refugees 
throughout the world. The facts are stark: a 
world refugee population of at least 8 million to 
10 miHion, an increasing number of other 
displaced persons and movements of peoples within 
regions in response to pressures of poverty or 
deprivation. UNHCR has helped to cope with this 
huge problem; success, however, has been mixed. 
UNHCR has assisted and continues to assist 
millions of refugees and displaced persons, but 
it needs the assurance of a continuing mandate, 
not a fixed-term mandate, and a vigorous pursuit 
of durable solutions, especially volun¬tary 
repatriation. It needs, too, a widened acceptance 
by the entire international community of the 
moral obligation to provide at least temporary 
refuge to those compelled to leave their own 
countries. Australia proposed a code of conduct 
embodying this principle of temporary refuge in 
Geneva two years ago. We shall be pursuing the 
initiative further in the Executive Committee of 
the High Commissioner and at a later stage here 
in the General Assembly itself.
124.	For many Governments and ordinary 
citizens the second special session on 
disarmament was a disappointment and its results 
limited. Nevertheless Australia considers that 
the session did help clear the air. It did 
establish, if not a meeting of minds, a better 
understanding of the essential basis of mutual 
con¬fidence if progress in arms control and 
disarmament is to be realized. It showed that a 
better under¬standing leading to an improvement 
in relations between East and West, essentially 
between the superpowers, is imperative if there 
is to be any significant progress in disarmament 
and, indeed, in other issues of strategic and 
political concern.
123. I conclude by returning to the earlier theme 
of the role and promise of the United Nations. 
State¬ments made in this debate already indicate 
a sense of failure, frustration or disappointment 
felt by many about the United Nations during the 
course of the year. While it may be argued that 
publicly held expectations of progress had been 
too high, it is undeniable that a serious crisis 
of pubic confidence now exists about the capacity 
of the United Nations to carry out some of its 
most central) responsibilities.
126.	Yet we must not turn away from the United 
Nations in frustration. Each nation must actively 
look for ways in which to strengthen public faith 
in the Organization and its potential capacity 
for negotiation and conciliation. We need less 
debate, less rhetoric and fewer resolutions; and 
more constructive effort, more effective action 
to resolve the major issues, including those of 
disarmament and development, which face us all. I 
hope that the Secretary-General's important and 
courageous comments will help to change the 
attitude of Member States towards adopting more 
responsible, more rational and more moderate 
approaches to the world community's problems. 
Australia is ready to play its part.
127.	We are a growing middle Power. White our 
historical links are with Europe, we are situated 
in the South-East Asian and South Pacific region. 
We are thus a country with interests spanning 
both the developing and the developed worlds. We 
see our role as one of exercising a reasoned, 
responsible and steady influence in the world 
community. We have a strong and abiding belief in 
the essential validity of the United Nations. The 
Secretary-General can count on Australia's 
support.
"
4110,37,1982,NZL,"Sir, I congratulate you on your election to the 
high office of the presidency. A heavy 
responsibility rests on your shoulders. This has 
been a turbulent year in international affairs. 
The shocks of the past 12 months are reflected in 
the agenda. This has been a testing time also for 
the new Secretary-General. He faces more hard 
tasks ahead.
43.	We have endured a year of crisis in the 
world economy. The international monetary system 
has teetered on the brink of catastrophe. The 
twin evils of inflation and unemployment have 
ranged throughout the world; growth has slowed 
almost to a halt.
44.	Nor has the world become a more peaceful 
and secure place. On the contrary. The Middle 
East has been a cockpit of war. We have just seen 
a massacre of unarmed civilians in Lebanon on a 
scale we find hard to believe. Afghanistan is 
still occupied and tyrannized by the Soviet 
Union. Vietnamese troops still hold Kampuchea. A 
totally avoidable war has been fought over some 
remote islands in the South Atlantic. Great-Power 
relationships have deteriorated. There has been 
no progress towards disarmament.
45.	I want to say a little more about the 
world economic situation. As a small trading 
nation, New Zealand is acutely sensitive to 
fluctuations in the health of our major trading 
partners. New Zealand is classed as a developed 
country, but we share many of the problems of 
developing countries. Our prosperity depends on 
the export of a relatively few primary products. 
In the current world situation, terms of trade 
run against us. When the economic giants sneeze, 
we do not catch cold; we catch pneumonia.
46.	It is not surprising therefore that my 
Government has taken a leading role in recent 
months in advocating a revitalization of the 
international economic and financial 
institutions. The system established at Bretton 
Woods 38 years ago served reasonably well during 
a long period of economic growth in the 1930s and 
1960s. There is a widespread agreement that it 
needs to be improved and strengthened, not tom 
down. There is no consensus yet as to how that 
can be achieved.
47.	At international meetings of Finance 
Ministers in recent weeks, the New Zealand Prime 
Minister has advocated an international 
conference to re-examine the role and adequacy of 
the international institutions established at 
Bretton Woods. Such a conference would require 
detailed groundwork and preparation. It is, 
perhaps, too early to spell out the agenda. What 
must first be demonstrated is the political will 
to undertake the task. My Government believes 
that that will exists in many countries, but some 
of the largest and most powerful Members of the 
Organi-zationóthose with the greatest economic 
cloutóhave still to be convinced.
48.	One thing is clear. The efforts that have 
been made in the Organization to effect progress 
through a North-South dialogue have reached 
stalemate. The very term  North-South  polarizes 
attitudes. Doctrinaire argument will get us 
nowhere. Nor will a retreat into policies of 
economic isolationism. The growth of 
protectionism is one of the most disturbing 
by-products of economic recession. It will not 
help growth in the powerful economies of the 
major industrialized countries, and its effects 
on the vulnerable economies of the developing 
countries can only be disastrous.
49.	Let me emphasize again the constructive 
purpose of my Government's call for a review of 
the international economic institutions. We wish 
to see them strengthened and, if necessary, 
supplemented. They may need new powers. They 
should be more responsive to genuine needs. In 
the financial field, they should be more flexible 
in the conditions they impose for lending. There 
should be a large increase in quotas to 
strengthen the position of the International 
Monetary Fund [IMF]. There is a need for 
discipline to apply to those countries which 
accumulate large surpluses in their balance of 
payments, as well as to tht.se which are forced 
into large deficits. This is sometimes called 
symmetrical surveillance. Greater regulatory 
powers than exist at present may be required. IMF is 
no longer facing cyclical downturns in member 
nations but long-term structural imbalances. Its 
rules must be adapted for longer-term lending and 
easier conditionality. A decision on these 
matters at a special meeting of the world 
community would make the political decision, 
country by country, to accept such changes much 
more easily.
50.	But these are only suggestions on our 
part. I repeat that what is needed is a clear 
demonstration of political will to embark on a 
new program designed to restore confidence in 
the world economic system. Only thus can we look 
for the world consensus required to implement 
such a program. May I say that we look to the 
major economic Powers to display both more 
determined leadership and a greater 
understanding of the problems faced by smaller 
and weaker economies than they have so far.
51.	Although far removed from the Middle 
East, New Zealand is closely concerned with what 
goes on there. We have friendly relations with 
all Middle East countries and important trading 
relations with an increasing number of them. The 
United Nations has an important role to play in 
maintaining peace in that area and it must 
continue to play that role despite the 
frustrations it faces. For many years New Zealand 
has contributed observers to the United Nations 
Truce Supervision Organization. We welcomed the 
restoration of peace between Egypt and Israel. 
We wanted to see a peace-keeping force 
established in the Sinai under United Nations 
auspices but, since that was not possible, we 
agreed to contribute to a force that was 
acceptable to both Egypt and Israel. In that way, 
we hope we have made an appropriate contribution 
not only to the peace-keeping but to the 
peace-making process.
52.	It is a matter of great concern to us 
that L at process has not continued as intended. 
New Zealand has consistently supported Security 
Council resolution 242 (1967). We believe that 
Israel is entitled to exist in peace behind 
secure borders. Equally, we believe that the 
Palestinian people are entitled to determine 
their own futures: and to establish their own 
State, if that is what they wish, following the 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied 
territories. We believe also that all foreign 
combat troops should be withdrawn from Lebanon. 
The innocent civilian population in that war-torn 
country has suffered long enough, if necessary, 
after the present temporary three-nation force is 
withdrawn from Beirut, the role ol' the United 
Nations peace keeping force should be expanded to 
stabilize the situation in Lebanon for as long as 
may be necessary.
53.	In his report on the work of the 
Organization the Secretary-General has commented 
with admirable frankness on the shortcomings of 
the United Nations in carrying out its primary 
task of preserving international peace and 
security. He has suggested ways in which the 
Security Council might operate with more 
authority. We support those suggestions. We 
believe that a greater willingness on the part of 
the great Powers to work together rather than 
against one another is the key to a more 
effective Security Council. Nevertheless, the 
non-permanent members also have an important part 
to play. We take seriously the obligation 
conferred by the Charter on the Members of the 
United Nations to make their own contribution to 
the maintenance of international peace and 
security. It is with that obligation very much in 
mind that New Zealand has presented its 
candidature for membership of the Council at the 
forthcoming elections.
54.	The situation in Kampuchea also remains 
of deep concern, h undermines the stability of 
Southeast Asia and adversely affects the security 
of our close friends in the Association of 
South-East Asian Nations. If unresolved, it 
carries the potential, by reviving great-Power 
rivalry in the area, to threaten the security of 
the wider Asia-Pacific region. More immediately 
the situation prolongs the human misery and 
suiting that have been a tragic fact of life m 
Kampuchea for too long.
55.	New Zealand firmly believes that any 
lasting solution to the situation in Kampuchea 
will have to take into account their legitimate 
interests of all the parties concerned. We hope 
that the year ahead will see some progress. The 
formation of the coalition Government in 
Kampuchea is a step in the right direction. We 
have never condoned the crimes and atrocities of 
Pol Pot and his associates and we welcome the 
broader representation of the Kampuchean people 
in the Government of Democratic Kampuchea.
56.	There is an important role for the United 
Nations in working out a settlement. We welcome 
the efforts of the Chairman of the /i J Hot 
Committee of the International Conference on 
Kampuchea as part of it.
57.	Another year has passed without progress 
in relations between North and South Korea. 
Tension remains high in the peninsula and the 
diversion of resources to military purposes 
continues. Families are still separated and a 
unique and ancient society remains divided. New 
Zealand does not believe that this situation need 
or should continue. My Government's view is that 
the way forward is through negotiations between 
the Korean peoples themselves. We exhort the 
North Korean authorities to respond positively to 
South Korea's various proposals for steps towards 
national reconciliation.
58.	With regard to Africa, my Government has 
followed closely the efforts of the five-member 
contact group to negotiate the withdrawal of 
South Africa from Namibia and permit the people 
of that country freely to exercise their right to 
self-determination and independence. Following 
the emergence of a Government in Zimbabwe 
reflecting the wishes of the majority, we 
expected to see more rapid progress towards the 
freeing of Namibia from illegal occupation. We 
hope that the situation will now be peacefully 
and speedily remedied and that the people of 
Namibia will very soon be able to decide their 
own future in free and fair elections. It is long 
since time Namibia took its rightful seat in the 
Organization.
59.	New Zealand maintains its steadfast 
opposition to the system of institutionalized 
racism imposed by a minority Government in South 
Africa on the vast majority of its people. New 
Zealand has no diplomatic or consular 
representative in that country. For many years we 
have embargoed the export of arms to South 
Africa. In accordance with its obligations, as a 
member of the Commonwealth, under the Gleneagles 
Agreement my Government has consistently sought 
to discourage sporting contacts with South 
Africa. The great majority of New Zealand sport 
organizations, including the Olympic and 
Commonwealth Games Association have steadfastly 
refrained from such contacts.
60.	It is time that the disgrace of apartheid 
was ended. It is an affront to human dignity. 
Tragically, the South African Government has 
ignored the calls of its own people and of the 
world that it dismantles the apartheid system and 
introduces one which upholds racial equality and 
respect for human rights and basic freedoms. Only 
then can South Africa resume a normal 
relationship with the rest of the world and play 
its proper role in a continent which has 
desperate need of its technology and resources.
61.	I should like to end by saying something 
about the small island countries of the South 
Pacific and their problems. These are, after all, 
New Zealand's closest neighbors and friends. We 
have with them strong ties of history and 
culture. Many of their people have migrated to 
New Zealand but retain close links with their 
island homes. New Zealand's overseas aid program 
is increasingly concentrated in these countries. 
We welcome the fact that the great majority of 
the island countries have now achieved 
independence or an advanced stage of 
self-government. Some of them now speak with a 
distinctive South Pacific voice in the 
Organization.
62.	it is good that self-determination in the 
South Pacific has been achieved peacefully. The 
process is, however, not yet complete. We welcome 
the progress that has taken place towards 
self-determination in the Trust Territory of 
Micronesia. We welcome also the program of reform 
which has been instituted by the French Government 
in New Caledonia. In common with our fellow 
members of the South Pacific Forum, we hope for 
quick progress towards the goal of 
self-determination for this Territory. We are 
actively promoting political development in the 
small island Territory of Tokelau and have 
welcomed visits by United Nations Missions to 
monitor its progress.
63.	The fragile economies of small island 
States pose enormous problems for their 
development. The United Nations criteria for 
least-developed States take insufficient account 
of the problems of minute size, lack of resources 
and extreme isolation, which are common to many 
of these island States. New Zealand has sought to 
help overcome these problems by lowering trade 
barriers, promoting private investment and 
helping to develop regional shipping services. We 
have welcomed the increased involvement of the 
United Nations in the South Pacific area. But 
more outside help is needed, and the small size 
of the recipient countries should not deter the 
appropriate international agencies from making a 
more effective contribution than they have up to 
now.
64.	One of the few significant resources 
which the South Pacific countries can export is 
fish. The most important part of this resource 
consists of the highly migratory species such as 
tuna. The establishment of the 200-mile economic 
zone under the United Nations Convention on the 
Law of the Sea offers the island countries the 
opportunity to exploit this resource for their 
own benefit. It is for that reason, among others, 
that New Zealand and other South Pacific 
countries are strong supporters of that 
Convention and look forward to its early entry 
into force. My Government will continue to urge 
the major industrialized countries to accept and 
become parties to the Convention. All South 
Pacific countries are naturally sensitive to the 
possibility of pollution of the surrounding 
ocean, for example by the dumping of nuclear 
waste. We are also strong advocates of the 
complete cessation of nuclear-weapons testing, 
especially in the Pacific. It is a matter of 
great regret and concern that the negotiation of 
a comprehensive test-ban treaty has virtually 
come to a halt.
65.	New Zealand and its South Pacific 
neighbors will continue to press for the 
conclusion of a test-ban treaty. Such a treaty 
not only will remove a possible environmental 
threat from our own backyard, but will be an 
important step towards nuclear disarmament, which 
has seen no progress in the past year but becomes 
more urgent day by day.
"
4115,37,1982,PNG,"Mr. President, I join the previous speakers in extending to you, on 
behalf of my Government, our congratulations on your election as 
President of the thirty seventh session of the General Assembly. My 
congratulations also go to your predecessor for the exemplary manner 
in which he conducted the proceedings of the last session. This 
session of the General Assembly is convening at a time when the very 
foundations of international peace, stability and prosperity are 
being assailed by global disharmony and serious economic crisis. 
Hardly a day goes by without our attention being drawn to a new and 
terrible flashpoint where reason and negotiation yield to rash and 
precipitous conflicts under arms. Border wars rage, and nations parry 
and thrust over the negotiating table with all too little concern for 
the consequences of their inability to compromise. On a different 
plane, where the stakes are much higher and the destructive 
capabilities terrifyingly lethal the super Powers have yet again 
failed to secure any meaningful agreement on nuclear arms limitation. 
The impunity with which nations flout the Charter, too, gives rise to 
our fears that true and lasting peace Is an impossible dream. As a 
small country, far removed from these areas of conflict, Papua New 
Guinea has no illusions about its position in the scheme of things. 
However, we feel obligated to draw the Assembly's attention to the 
perspective we hold of the deterioration of relations between 
countries. Our concern also extends to the growing disparity between 
the industrial and non industrial countries. We are therefore 
compelled to express our concern at the indifference shown by 
industrial countries in procrastinating in the implementation of 
successive economic summits dealing with the world economic order.
423
Papua New Guinea believes that removing the threat of armed conflict 
and establishing procedures designed to assist the economic 
improvement of poor nations are the two issues requiring the urgent 
attention of the General Assembly. These are not new issues in the 
General Assembly's agenda. They have in fact been debated many times 
both here and in other international to rums. Regrettably, on each 
occasion, no satisfactory solution has been reached. My Government 
believes that the time is now overdue for all of us to make some real 
progress on these crucial issues. Instituting reforms to correct 
these anomalies will require a degree of strength and unity of 
purpose which has so far eluded the Assembly. My Government therefore 
hopes that at this session the Assembly will distinguish itself by 
finding common ground where these and other issues of global concern 
can be resolved. I now wish to address myself to those specific 
issues that my Government considers appropriate for debate in this 
forum. My Government continues to consider colonialism an anachronism 
of our times. We fully share the view that dependent and Non Self 
Governing Territories must be given the opportunity to exercise their 
inalienable right to self determination and independence as 
stipulated in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. Papua 
New Guinea, like other independent Pacific island countries, is 
particularly concerned with the remaining dependent Territories of 
the Pacific region. Since Papua New Guinea became independent seven 
years ago, we have been obliged to support independence for our 
Pacific island neighbors. Our resolve in this respect today is 
undiminished. We shall continue to ensure that the colonial era in 
the Pacific region comes to an end. We note with satisfaction the 
recent developments within New Caledonia resulting in greater 
participation of the Melanesian people in the Council of Government. 
We commend the French Government on the reforms which are aimed at 
achieving greater political, economic and social benefits for the 
indigenous Melanesian population. We trust that this is an integral 
part of an evolutionary process which will eventually lead New 
Caledonia to plan its own destiny towards independence. Hence, 
pleased as we are at the progress made so far, we cannot be fully 
content until we see the emergence of an independent New Caledonia. 
These views were echoed at the South Pacific Forum meeting in August. 
We urged the French Government to work closely with the Kanak people 
of New Caledonia in formulating a political programme for a peaceful 
transition to independence. We also hope that other French 
Territories in the Pacific are given equal opportunities to determine 
their own future.

I also wish to state that Papua New Guinea cannot be indifferent if 
the Micronesian people of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands 
are denied their right to decide their own future. We acknowledge the 
efforts that are being made by the United States Government to place 
before the people of Micronesia a range of options which will include 
a plebiscite to enable them to determine their own future. To deny 
them these options would be contrary to the principles of the Charter 
of the United Nations and the spirit of the Trusteeship. Who is 
better able to decide whether the Micronesian people are ready for 
self determination than the Micronesians themselves? Over the past 
few years we have witnessed the resurgence of a particularly 
deplorable world wide phenomenon. I speak here of the tendency of 
countries in recent times totally to disregard the principles of 
sovereignty and independence of other States by pursuing blatant acts 
of aggression and interference. It is indeed disheartening to note 
that those same States, which have representatives at the Assembly, 
freely abuse the principles of the Charter. The use of superior 
economic and military strength to invade small countries for the 
purpose of securing spheres of influence is a matter of the utmost 
concern to my Government.
A prime example was Viet Nam's invasion of Kampuchea in late 1978, 
and its installation of a puppet regime. The Kampuchean people have 
suffered intolerably; thousands have been killed and others have fled 
to neighboring and far away countries to seek sanctuary. Together 
with other concerned countries, Papua New Guinea supported 
initiatives to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of 
Kampuchea. We actively participated in the International Conference 
on Kampuchea held here last year. 13. Last year Papua New Guinea, 
along with the Association of South East Asian Nations and many 
States Members of the United Nations, adopted a declaration which 
advocated a negotiated settlement of the problem of Kampuchea. Viet 
Nam's continued rejection of these calls has necessitated the recent 
formation of a Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. We 
consider this development a positive move and therefore pledge our 
support, together with the member States of ASEAN, in welcoming the 
formation of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. The 
Afghanistan issue is somewhat analogous to the Kampuchea issue. Papua 
New Guinea has opposed and will continue to oppose the foreign 
occupation of Afghanistan. We note with regret that the Soviet Union 
has not responded to Genera! Assembly resolution 36/34, calling for 
the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops 
from Afghanistan. We believe that the situation in Afghanistan cannot 
be normalized as long as foreign troops are present in that country.

While taking note of the second special session of the General 
Assembly devoted to disarmament this year, we are dismayed that there 
has been no real effort to reduce the manufacturing and stockpiling 
of trade in both conventional and nuclear weapons. My Government, 
nevertheless, commends the efforts of the Committee on Disarmament to 
curb the arms race. While we have not succeeded in effecting a 
comprehensive reduction in arms, the fact that both bilateral and 
multilateral disarmament measures exist in the form of treaties and 
conventions provides some hope for optimism. There is, however, a 
great danger in the belief that armaments are causes of war. Arms do 
not decide to go to war; it is human decisions that put them to war. 
Arms control alone cannot remove the possibility of war, but arms 
control backed by political will can prevent war and contribute to 
peace and security. Another alarming aspect of the arms race is the 
expansion in nuclear weaponry. For a number of years now one of the 
major tasks of the United Nations has been to promote the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy while attempting to deter its military 
application. In spite of those efforts, however, nations still find 
reason to develop nuclear weapons. Like our neighbors in the South 
Pacific, we are increasingly alarmed at the continued testing of 
nuclear weapons in the region by outside Powers. At this year's 
meeting of the South Pacific Forum, the Pacific island leaders again 
strongly condemned France for its nuclear activities in our region 
and called for an immediate halt to them. Furthermore, the Forum 
called on those States with nuclear capability not to store or dump 
nuclear wastes in the Pacific. We object to the long  term effects of 
nuclear experimentation, which could adversely affect the lives and 
the welfare of our people. It is against this background that Papua 
New Guinea is totally opposed to nuclear testing and to the dumping 
of nuclear wastes in the region. For many sessions now the Assembly 
has adopted resolutions condemning South Africa and seeking to 
eliminate its abhorrent policy of Papua New Guinea finds it difficult 
to understand why some members of this body continue to condone the 
actions of a regime which has persistently spumed United Nations 
resolutions and yet continue to support South Africa indirectly 
through trade and other relations. I make particular reference here 
to those countries which saw fit to veto a Security Council draft 
resolution in April 1981 requesting Members of the United Nations to 
impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa. 
Their actions in this respect are indicative of the indifference of 
some Members of this world body who profess to be guardians of the 
rights and dignity of mankind. It is this kind of hypocrisy that 
provides reason for the Pretoria Government to continue pursuing its 
repugnant racist policies. The attitude so far displayed by these 
countries evokes no optimism concerning the total abolition. My 
delegation looks forward to the time when all Members of the 
Organization can sincerely and effectively impose trade and economic 
sanctions against South Africa. When that time comes, and my 
Government hopes it will come soon, it will be a triumphant 
vindication of the human values which have been totally repudiated by 
the South African Government.

It would be remiss of me to bypass Namibia at this juncture. Papua 
New Guinea has supported and will continue to support United Nations 
efforts to accord Namibia the right to free itself from its 
subservient role to South Africa. We shall continue to press for an 
early and peaceful settlement to this long standing question, as 
provided for in Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 439 
(1978). We find consolation in the efforts of the contact group of 
Western States. However, we strongly urge all concerned speedily to 
facilitate a durable solution for Namibia's independence. The Middle 
East issue will continue to be of grave concern if the recent and 
unfortunate events in Lebanon are not properly resolved. These events 
have surely undermined the efforts of the parties concerned to find a 
lasting solution to the problems of the sovereign State of Lebanon. 
We are particularly concerned that Israel's action has led to the 
massacre and undue suffering of hundreds of innocent Lebanese 
civilians and Palestinian refugees in west Beirut. We abhor such 
action, irrespective of whoever is responsible. Although we 
acknowledge Israel's right to exist and thus to defend its political 
and territorial integrity, Papua New Guinea also firmly believes that 
this longstanding crisis can never be resolved without acknowledging 
the Palestinians' right to have their own State. Papua New Guinea 
recognizes that right and will support any initiatives that are aimed 
at convening a conference on Palestine as a means to finding a 
lasting settlement to the Middle East situation. After many years of 
protracted negotiations, my Government was happy to welcome the 
adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 
April this year. We, however, remain disappointed that certain 
countries sought to alter some fundamental provisions of the 
Convention. I feel obliged to remind those countries that the 
provisions in question are there for the benefit of mankind. My 
Government is especially concerned that the United States has decided 
not to become a party to the Convention when it is opened for 
signature. Papua New Guinea's concern stems from the fact that key 
provisions within the Convention relating to sea bed mining may not 
be effectively implemented, white some industrial countries 
possessing sea bed mining technology fail to support the Convention. 
Papua New Guinea trusts and urges other industrial States to support 
the Convention as the principal treaty governing the exploitation of 
resources of the world's oceans. The single most important issue 
facing the world community today is the current global economic 
recession, especially the adverse impact it has had on the economic 
and social well being of all nations. Against the background of the 
current world economic crisis, Papua New Guinea joins other nations 
in recognizing that co operation at the international level is 
urgently requested in order to arrest and improve the deteriorating 
economic situation. We are aware that the world economy has suffered 
over the past decade from problems arising from inflation, high 
interest rates, exchange rate instability, deteriorating terms of 
trade in commodities, rising unemployment, slow growth and 
protectionism. Because of the general downturn in economic growth, 
industrial countries have had to apply so called safeguard measures 
in order to cope with their own domestic pressures. Thus we have seen 
substantial falls in the industrial countries' demands for non 
industrial country products, the proliferation of tariff and non 
tariff barriers and a general drift towards protectionism. In 
addition there has been, a substantial reduction m the flow of 
official aid and development finance to developing countries. Trade 
barriers in various forms have effectively curtailed markets for non 
industrial country exports Most of the restrictions have been 
concentrated on manufactured products, although agricultural products 
have been subjected to similar restrictions as well. As most of the 
barriers to trade exist outside international rules, efforts to limit 
their restrictive and trade distorting effects have never been 
successful. We in the Pacific have suffered because of a serious drop 
in the demand for those agricultural commodities upon which we are so 
dependent, such as copra, cocoa, palm oil, fish and timber. Our. 
small Pacific economies often rely for survival on the income from 
just one or two of these primary products Marginal changes in the 
volume and price of agricultural imports from industrial countries 
result in plummeting prices for non industrial countries like ours. 
At this point I must pay a tribute to the efforts of the European 
Economic Community to compensate its associated African, Caribbean 
and Pacific countries for drops m export earnings. Papua New Guinea 
has recently benefited from this STABEX scheme, Stabilization System 
for Export Earnings, and is due to receive additional loan and grant 
finance. This assistance is certainly appreciated, but let us all not 
forget that relatively small loans can only be partial compensation 
for the much larger drops in export earnings we have been forced to 
bear. STABEX though welcome, is merely a palliative. We must all 
still strive for a new international economic order in which the 
small producers are not forced to bear a disproportionate share of 
the sacrifices all have to make during times of economic recession. 
Papua New Guinea, like many other countries, is experiencing dramatic 
falls in foreign exchange earnings. Consequently, like other 
countries, it has been forced with very serious balance of payments 
difficulties and problems of debt servicing. Both industrial and non 
industrial countries have a responsibility to help revitalize and 
rearrange the current economic order. Economic recovery depends upon 
a number of factors, such as the elimination of trade barriers and 
the elimination of other barriers that restrict trade growth. In 
this' regard, we urge GATT at the next ministerial meeting and UNCTAD 
at the sixth session to establish effective proposals for economic 
recovery. There is one other area of concern to my Government. This 
is in regard to the way in which quotas are distributed under current 
international commodity agreements. During the recent meetings of the 
International Coffee Organization in London, for example, it was 
quite evident that the major coffee producing nations used their 
economic power to increase. their quotas, to the detriment of smaller 
producers like my own country. Papua New Guinea would like to see a 
fairer, a more equitable distribution of quotas so that justice not 
only is done but is seen to be done. There are many problems that 
beset our world today. Although I have only touched on some of them, 
a!! of them need to be solved, and solve them we must. To do this, 
however, we need one another's shoulders to carry the burden jointly. 
But to do this effectively we need the political will to do it, a 
factor which is required if most of our collective endeavors are to 
succeed now and in the future. My delegation Relieves that it is 
pointless discussing what can be done unless we first establish that 
there is a collective will to do it. Only then can we hope to create 
a world order in which States can strive to live together in peace, 
stability and prosperity.
"
4157,53,1998,VUT,"On behalf of the people
and the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu, I wish
to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Didier
Opertti on his election to this high and important post.
His unanimous election as President of the General
Assembly at its fifty-third session shows the esteem in
which the international community holds both him
personally and his country, Uruguay. The Republic of
Vanuatu and its delegation are confident he will guide
this fifty-third session of the General Assembly to a
successful conclusion.
May I also take this opportunity to express my
delegation?s sincere appreciation to his predecessor,
Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship
in facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the
24


General Assembly. I also wish to commend our Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise leadership and his
dedication to the reform and restructuring of our
Organization. We ask the President to assure him of our
total support.
Three years ago, we all gathered here to celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary of our Organization and, in particular,
to renew our commitment to the fundamental principles that
created it in 1945.
We also made a strong commitment to further
strengthen our genuine, collaborative efforts to ensure that
this Organization continues to promote global peace, justice
and a healthy environment, as well as to support the
process of sustainable development of its Member nations,
in particular the small island least developed countries such
as those in the Pacific region, including the Republic of
Vanuatu.
The current international political and economic
situation has grown ever more complex and makes
increasing demands on our own resources and on the
support available from our development partners.
We are deeply concerned by the continuing escalation
of such international crimes as drug-trafficking, money-
laundering, terrorism, organized crime and other similar
activities which have the potential to place the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of small island States at great risk.
The international community must show its genuine
collaboration in combating these criminal phenomena if the
new philosophy of globalization is to progress in a positive
manner.
We do not believe that the world is doing justice to its
people and to the fundamental principles of peace and
economic prosperity as enshrined in the Charter of the
United Nations if we do not observe our joint call for the
disarmament of nuclear weapons and other weapons of
mass destruction. International security cannot be
guaranteed if we fail to accord priority attention and
resources to the education and health of humankind and its
survival into the next millennium.
The momentum of the fiftieth anniversary of our
Organization, the lessons we have learned from past
mistakes and our renewed commitment must guide us in
our pursuit of a better world where, through this
Organization, a renewed sense of mutual trust and genuine
dialogue can be achieved to ease political tensions and
economic crises in all regions and subregions of the planet.
In our part of the world, these new developments
constitute a real threat to the already vulnerable
environment of our island economies and populations.
Confronted with these challenges, many countries in the
Pacific region, including the Republic of Vanuatu, do not
have much choice, at the end of this century, but to
embark on difficult programmes of reform both within
their respective Governments and within their societies.
Last year, my predecessor, The Honourable Serge
Vohor, advised this Assembly that Vanuatu had initiated
a comprehensive reform programme, with the support of
both multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and
countries. He also made an appeal to this Assembly,
explaining that in order for the reform programme to be
successful and responsive to the needs of the national
population, 80 per cent of whom live from subsistence
farming in rural areas, Vanuatu would continue to need
the special support accorded to it as a least developed
country.
The role of Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko and the
Secretary-General in subsequently facilitating a
constructive dialogue and a comprehensive appreciation
of the economic hardships of Vanuatu must be
commended.
In this regard, the Government and the people of
Vanuatu warmly welcome the recent decision of the
Economic and Social Council of the United Nations to
defer consideration of Vanuatu?s graduation from least
developed country status, pending full assessment of the
usefulness of the vulnerability index and ecological
fragility as criteria for least developed country
designation. We would like to register our most sincere
appreciation and recognition to each and every country
and group of countries for their support.
One of the commitments we all made during the
fiftieth anniversary celebrations in 1995 was to reform our
Organization so that it could be effective in addressing
the problems and needs of its Member States, both
individually and as a group.
From our perspective — and we have no doubt that
others share it — the United Nations must include in its
reform agenda a full assessment and recognition of the
inherent particularities of small island States such as the
Republic of Vanuatu, and the impact of the international
economic crisis on their economic performance and the
sustainability of their political stability.
25


The impact of the Asian economic situation and such
recurrent national disasters as tropical cyclones, tidal waves
and global warming on our island economies has yet to be
fully appraised. This warrants the urgent and dedicated
attention of our Organization.
With particular regard to the environment, the first
chapter of the Barbados Programme of Action for the
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States
clearly states that small island States are particularly
vulnerable to global climate change and rising sea levels.
We would therefore like to suggest, in the spirit of
reform, that the current scope of development-related
indicators being used by the United Nations to designate the
status of each Member State be thoroughly reviewed in
close consultation with the Member States and other
regional and multilateral organizations, such as the South
Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth.
This is an important exercise at a time when we must
adjust our national administrative structures, policy
directives and legal framework to gradually accommodate
the requirements of globalization. It would be unfair and
unrealistic to expect small island least developed countries
to satisfy all the administrative, financial and legal
requirements of the World Trade Organization, for instance,
within the same time-frame as the developed countries. An
effective sequencing of the accession process is needed,
taking into account the capacity of each country?s political
and economic system or structure to adjust without
affecting social cohesion.
The Republic of Vanuatu is committed to the principle
of global trade liberalization. The current reform
programme reflects this. We are asking the international
community to recognize that we should be allowed to be
integrated on a gradual basis, taking into account our
capacity to administer the process and to adjust to the new
environment.
It is in this same spirit that the Government of the
Republic of Vanuatu welcomes the decision of the fifty-
second session of the General Assembly to convene the
Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed
Countries in the year 2001.
It is still in this spirit that the Government of the
Republic of Vanuatu endorses the Declaration of the eighth
annual meeting of ministers from least developed countries,
adopted on 28 September 1998.
The Republic of Vanuatu is proud to be associated
this year with the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of
the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.
I am pleased to advise this Assembly that the current
reform programme of the Republic of Vanuatu has taken
full account of the above principles and the Government?s
commitment in this regard.
An example of this commitment is our wider
recognition of the rights and the role of women in our
society through the establishment, within the Prime
Minister?s portfolio, of a more systematic mechanism of
constructive dialogue between the Government on the one
hand, and the National Council of Women and other non-
governmental organizations on the other hand. The recent
enactment of a first ever leadership code for Vanuatu is
another example in this regard. This will not only ensure
good governance, transparency and the rule of law, but
will also act as an effective deterrent to corruption and
abuse of power by national leaders in political circles, in
public service and in the religious community, as well as
in traditional society.
The pursuit and promotion of a free and responsible
press and the protection of individual rights are matters
which are receiving more attention under the reform
programme. These are real challenges to Vanuatu today,
but they are challenges which we are confident that we
can successfully address over time with the necessary
support of the international community.
The right to self-determination must also continue to
occupy our agenda. The United Nations, as mandated by
its Charter, must be seen to encourage and support
dialogue at appropriate political levels in the regions and
countries where human sufferings and social disorder
continue as a direct result of conflict of opinions on the
issue of self-determination. In the Pacific region, we
warmly welcomed the signing earlier this year of the
Noumea Accord between the French Government and the
major political parties in New Caledonia. We believe that
this new agreement marks a stronger commitment by all
parties to work together to support an irreversible trend
for the future political status of New Caledonia.
As I said earlier, the world and our Organization will
be going through very challenging times as we are set to
turn the page of this century and start a new one. The
credibility of the United Nations in the next millennium
will be measured in terms of its effectiveness in
26


responding to the real situations prevailing in its Member
States, especially in small island States. It is therefore vital
that we all support and supplement the process of reform
spearheaded by the Secretary-General and aimed at
streamlining and strengthening the Organization.





"
4187,53,1998,AUS,"On behalf of the Foreign
Minister of Australia, Mr. Alexander Downer, who is
unable to be here because of our national election next
23


week, I would like to extend warm congratulations to you,
Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly
at its fifty-third session. Your country, Uruguay, has given
consistent and strong support to the United Nations, and
your own expertise and contribution to the development of
international law in particular is widely recognized. We
know that we are in good hands, just as we were last year
with your predecessor, Hennadiy Udovenko. Like him, you
may count on Australiaâs support as you carry out your
responsibilities and work to guide us towards constructive
and worthwhile outcomes.
As was very clear from the range of issues addressed
on the first day and again this morning in the general
debate, you take up the presidency, Sir, at a time when the
agenda before the United Nations is more challenging than
it has ever been. Australia is very concerned about many of
those challenges and issues. But today I want to focus
particularly on the subject of non-proliferation and
disarmament, where recent events have brought us to a
crossroads in our attempts to steer the world away from the
threat of weapons of mass destruction.
Although we heard some pessimistic perspectives
yesterday, in Australiaâs view the progress that the
international community has made in the field of arms
control and disarmament over recent decades has, in fact,
been remarkable â€” a trend to which the end of the cold
war lent added impetus. Many bilateral, regional and
international agreements have been concluded, all making
a contribution to making our world more secure. Those
achievements were driven by the realization that we must
work with determination towards a situation where the right
to self-defence of all nations, which is, after all, enshrined
in the United Nations Charter, must be ensured at the
lowest possible level of conventional armament and without
recourse at all to weapons of mass destruction. Events
which have moved against the tide of this progress have
been relatively rare, but when they have occurred they have
stood in stark contrast to the preferred direction of the
international community.
A survey of the progress made to date in the field of
arms control and disarmament points to two key
conclusions. The first is self-evident: there is more work to
be done. The second is perhaps easier to overlook. In the
face of periodic setbacks and challenges, it is vitally
important, and in the security interests of all countries, that
we stay the course on arms control and disarmament, that
we not underestimate or take for granted the value of what
has been achieved to date, and that we maintain the broad-
based political commitment to the norms and institutions
that we have put in place or have yet to build.
A stock-take of progress in arms control and
disarmament over recent decades leaves no doubt about
the positive direction in which the community is moving
in building a global security architecture. In addition to
agreements on conventional arms limitation and
transparency measures, the balance sheet for weapons of
mass destruction is particularly impressive.
A Treaty banning an entire category of weapons of
mass destruction â€” the Chemical Weapons
Convention â€” was successfully negotiated and has
attracted widespread support, and efforts are under way to
strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention.
A milestone Treaty now exists â€” the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) â€”
which bans all nuclear-weapon test explosions and all
other nuclear explosions.
Long called-for by political leaders from across all
regions, hard-negotiated in the Conference on
Disarmament and finally adopted by the Assembly by an
overwhelming majority two years ago, the CTBT has now
attracted the adherence of over 150 States, and its
institutional fabric is being steadily established.
The cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation
regime â€” the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT) â€” has been extended indefinitely and
has achieved near-universal membership, and agreement
has been reached to commence negotiations to ban the
production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons.
In another area, under the strategic arms reductions
process, or START, and consistent with article VI of the
NPT, deep cuts have been made in the cold-war arsenals
of the two largest possessors of nuclear weapons, bringing
closer the day when plurilateral and multilateral phases of
nuclear disarmament can realistically be envisaged.
With START I almost fully implemented, the United
States and the Russian Federation, from which we have
just heard, have more than halved their holdings of
strategic nuclear warheads over the past decade. START
III will bring those same arsenals down to some 80 per
cent below cold-war peaks. It is clearly very important for
START II to enter into force quickly so that planning for
implementation can begin, ensuring there is no
interruption to the nuclear disarmament process.
The international nuclear safeguards systems have
also been strengthened, enhancing international confidence
in the integrity of this regime and its ability to detect and
24


deter non-compliance with non-proliferation obligations.
And finally, a treaty banning landmines â€” what some have
called weapons of mass destruction in slow motion â€” has
been concluded.
On the other side of the ledger, the non-proliferation
and disarmament regimes have had to withstand serious
challenges from the Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea
and from Iraq, and the progress towards a universal no-
nuclear-testing norm has been seriously jolted by sporadic
outbreaks of testing, most recently by India and Pakistan.
Unresolved regional tensions in South Asia and the Middle
East continue to bedevil and to thwart the attainment of the
goal of universal membership of the NPT. While being
justifiably dismayed at the disdain of the few for the clearly
expressed will of the international community, we can also
draw encouragement from the strength of our national and
collective responses to these challenges and the resilience
of the regimes when so challenged.
It is vitally important that we stay the course, that we
ensure that such events amount to no more than temporary
deviations from the near-universally accepted norm against
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We
believe that this is in Australiaâs national interest and in the
interest of international and regional security to uphold the
nuclear and other non-proliferation regimes and to continue
to do our utmost to pursue effective measures to reduce and
eliminate the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.
In a strange way, the periodic setbacks to these efforts
serve to underscore the value of the progress made to date.
The very existence of the NPT, and its near-universal
membership, highlights the unacceptability of embarking
upon a nuclear-weapon programme in todayâs world.
Similarly, it is the very existence of the CTBT, and the
near-universal point of view it represents â€” namely, that
nuclear testing should be a thing of the past â€” that
rendered more powerful the widespread disapproval of the
spate of nuclear tests earlier this year. The new ratifications
which the CTBT attracted following the South Asian
nuclear tests were eloquent testimony to the confidence of
the international community in and its commitment to the
no-testing norm.
Australia would like to take this public opportunity to
congratulate Brazil and to welcome it as the most recent
member of the family of NPT nations. We call on that
handful of States remaining outside the NPT to reflect on
the possibility that the 187 countries which have decided
that the NPT provides greater security than the nuclear-
weapons option might be right, and that they â€” the
outsiders â€” might be wrong. Australia also calls on them
to consider how much more seriously their national
security interests would be degraded in a world where the
overwhelming majority of States had not embraced the
nuclear non-proliferation norm.
My country, as I think is well known, has long been
a very firm supporter of universal adherence to treaties on
international weapons of mass destruction. We have
signed all 13 multilateral arms control and disarmament
treaties and ratified all of these bar one; ratification of the
Ottawa Convention on landmines, I am happy to say, is
in progress. Only four other countries can match this
record. We remain committed to making a difference
where and when we can in building consensus on the way
forward, and we will continue to be as diligent and as
creative as possible across the full range of arms-control
and disarmament issues.
Our focus, for those who know us well, is always on
results rather than rhetoric and on making pragmatic
contributions where we can, illustrated by the sort of
contributions that we have made to helping to negotiate
the key Conventions to which I have referred and by our
support for building and strengthening the institutions
which work in various ways to support international arms-
control and disarmament goals â€” institutions such as the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the
Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO), the Association of South-East Asian Nations
(ASEAN) Regional Forum and the nuclear safeguards
system.
Experience has shown that these regimes cannot be
taken for granted. The existing regimes need continual
care, maintenance and vigilance to ensure that they
remain effective and that political and financial
commitment to them remains strong.
In the NPT area, for example, further work is needed
to maintain the strength of the Treaty and to go on to
achieve its full implementation and universality. The sixth
Review Conference, in the year 2000, following on the
recent serious challenges to the non-proliferation norm, to
which I have referred, will be one of the most significant
in the history of the Treaty. But even if we have a
distance to go in terms of the Treatyâs value, surely no
one would argue that the world would be a safer place
without it. Nor could it be argued that the negotiation of
the Treaty back in the late 1960s, and the maintenance
and strengthening of the Treaty ever since, has not been
worth the effort.
25


And to those few who persist with the tired refrain
that the NPT is a discriminatory Treaty, we say â€œYes, it isâ€,
and for one excellent reason: the NPT allows a temporary
state of discrimination between the nuclear-weapon States
and the rest of us because, quite simply, the alternative was,
and still is, too horrible to contemplate. We might lament
that because of the cold war the state of discrimination
lasted far too long, but we surely cannot argue that the
alternative scenario would have made the world a safer
place than it is today. For it was a commonplace of
political forecasts in the 1960s, when nuclear weapons were
a legitimate security option for any State, that over 20
States, including my own, Australia, would likely choose to
exercise that option.
And it is surely perverse, when the titanic arsenals of
nuclear weapons accumulated during the cold war are at
last being drastically cut, to act against the tide of
disarmament by pursuing the nuclear option.
Similarly, no one could argue that we would be better
off without a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Its
conclusion, its signature by the five nuclear-weapon States
and its ratification to date by two are major
achievements â€” all the more reason to press ahead with
the establishment of the Treatyâs implementation and
verification structures.
A strong start has been made in implementing the
Chemical Weapons Convention. Its effectiveness is already
amply demonstrated, but we need continued political will
and financial commitment, as well as the additional
ratifications and accessions, for the full security benefits of
the Convention to be realized.
Similarly, the Biological Weapons Convention is
weakened by its lack of verification and compliance
provisions. Work is now under way in the Ad Hoc Group
negotiations to rectify this deficiency. We strongly support
this Ad Hoc Group and are working together with others to
produce an effective and workable protocol to strengthen
the Biological Weapons Convention.
One of the things that we have been doing â€” and
people may have seen the reference to a meeting about this
in todayâs Journal â€” has been to work collaboratively with
many other countries to convene an informal meeting of
Foreign Ministers. This informal meeting is going to be
held tomorrow, here in New York, and it represents the
determination of many countries, at high political levels, to
work together to bring us closer to the goal of an early
conclusion of an effective protocol to strengthen the
Biological Weapons Convention.
In conjunction with the international communityâs
efforts to achieve full implementation and universality of
existing regimes, we also need new, reinforcing and
complementary steps to achieve our overall arms control
and disarmament goals.
Commencement of negotiations for a fissile material
cut-off treaty is an excellent example of how we should
be moving forward in this respect. We see it as the next
logical step after the CTBT, and it is one to which we
hope the Assembly will lend unequivocal support and
encouragement. The recent agreement in the Conference
on Disarmament in Geneva to commence negotiations on
a cut-off treaty demonstrates, we believe, the resilience of
the non-proliferation regime under pressure. It gives the
lie to those who recently pronounced it dead. It is a sign
of the international community reaffirming its faith in the
non-proliferation principle to which it has been committed
for the past 30 years.
I want to refer very briefly to three more subjects:
United Nations reform, human rights and peacekeeping.
Like most other Member States, we want this
Organization to work better. Some progress has been
made. We welcomed the agreement reached on key
elements of the Secretary-Generalâs reform package.
Indeed, we worked hard and quietly to help bring this
about. But it is now very important to ensure that what
has been agreed is effectively implemented â€” that the
task force and the reviews of specific aspects of United
Nations organizations all actually produce concrete
outcomes and that real change does in fact occur.
Critical to the achievement of real reform will be the
resolution of the ongoing problem of non-payment of
arrears in financial contributions. The failure of many
Member States, including the major contributor, to
address this situation hinders all our efforts to strengthen
this Organization.
Also, much of the reform process to us appears to
have been focused on rationalizing and refining structures
and mechanisms and on administrative measures. We
think that the next phase of the reform process has to give
much more structured thought â€” and I believe that this
is what the Secretary-General has in mind in his
presentations to date on the Millennium Assembly â€” to
the kind of United Nations we expect and want in the
decades to come. A thorough review of priorities is
overdue. Although the lofty ideals enshrined in the United
Nations Charter remain as valid as ever, we need to give
serious thought to modernizing the ways in which we
26


give effect to those objectives in terms of operational
activities.
Australia is concerned, like so many others who have
spoken in the general debate to date, that the debate on
Security Council reform has stalled. We have had an
exhaustive â€” but, regrettably, inconclusive â€” discussion
over the last year. It is time now to move beyond general
discussion to serious negotiation of a reform package, one
which will usher in a remodelled Council that is more
representative, transparent and suited to the new
millennium. This will require serious engagement and
flexibility from all involved. My Government remains
committed to finding ways to move the debate forward.
Those of you who were here at last yearâs session of
the General Assembly may recall that Foreign Minister
Downer raised the issue of electoral groups. We continue
to assert that this is an important element in the reform
debate. It is over 30 years since the last significant change
was made to the regional groups. The drawbacks of the
present configuration are becoming more and more obvious:
substantial disparities in the size of the various groups and
an inadequate level of representation available to many
subregions, including Australiaâs own geographical area of
East Asia and the Pacific. We have noted that there is
gathering interest among Member States in this subject, and
we think it is time that we recognized it as an element of
reform which needs to be addressed. Changing the groups
to reflect better contemporary realities and the interests of
the current membership will, we recognize, require careful
thought and patient discussion, and it is simply far too early
to put forward any particular formula. But we suggest we
could begin by discussing the principles on which a new
system could be built and by exchanging views in a
thoughtful and non-acrimonious way on how we might take
the process forward.
The year 1998 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and also 50 years
of United Nations peacekeeping. Australiaâs commitment to
upholding the fundamental human rights enshrined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains as strong
now as it was in 1948, when the Declaration was
proclaimed. Members may not know that Australia was one
of the eight countries tasked with the drafting of the
Declaration and that we also played an important role in
ensuring that human rights provisions were included in the
United Nations Charter. Fifty years ago, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights represented a common
statement of goals and aspirations, a vision of the world as
the international community would want it to become.
We still believe in that vision and we see the fiftieth
anniversary as a time for the international community to
reaffirm its commitment to this powerful document.
Similarly, the 50 years of United Nations peacekeeping
gives us an opportunity to recognize how far the
institution of peacekeeping has come, to take stock of the
lessons we have learnt from the past and, perhaps most
importantly, to pay tribute to over 1,500 peacekeepers
who have made the ultimate sacrifice for a safer and
more peaceful world.
Whether we are talking of old problems or new
ones, whether we are analysing setbacks or successes, or
marking anniversaries, the annual stocktake which this
general debate represents offers the opportunity not for a
series of set speeches unrelated to each other and ticking
off a lot of subjects, but rather a chance to remind
ourselves of what the United Nations stands for, to
recognize what has been achieved to date, and to
recommit ourselves for the future to protecting and
advancing those achievements.
I have focused today on disarmament not only as an
area of the utmost priority for Australia and Australians,
but also as one where we believe we can add value. But
the parallels and lessons of disarmament and non-
proliferation hold good for other areas of the United
Nations activities.
I said at the very outset that the international
community was at a crossroads in our attempts to build
an international dispensation in which the threat of mass
destruction had no place. The achievements of the last 30
years in setting in place treaties, institutions and norms to
ensure that we move in that direction are impressive. But
they are not invulnerable. Inadequate verification, non-
compliance, aberrant behaviour, budget fatigue, reform
fatigue failure of political will â€” all of these things have
the potential to unravel and to undermine what we have
built together. Effective arms control, disarmament and
non-proliferation â€” like all the other subjects that are
being addressed from this rostrum â€” require large
investments of political and economic capital. It might be
natural at times, particularly challenging and worrying
times such as we are currently experiencing, to wonder if
it is worth the cost. Brief consideration of the alternatives
is surely enough to convince us that the answer is
undoubtedly â€œyesâ€.
To do otherwise would be to betray not only the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights which we are
commemorating, but also the very principles of the
United Nations Charter.






"
4213,53,1998,NZL,"May I start, Sir, by
congratulating Mr. Opertti on his election as President of
this great Assembly, and wishing him well as he guides
its deliberations. I was privileged to visit his country,
Uruguay, earlier this year, and appreciated the warmth
and hospitality on that occasion.
I would also like to express our thanks to his
predecessor, Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, who, with
considerable commitment, presided over the introduction
of many important reform measures during the past
session.
Each year this debate provides an opportunity to take
a longer perspective on the United Nations — to look
back and, of course, to look ahead. We have
achievements to acknowledge and challenges for the
future to consider. In doing so, our view is informed by
present-day conditions. We are living in very difficult
times. The economic events that have unfolded over the
last year, initially in Asia, now show signs of having a
global impact. They will affect developed and developing
countries alike across most regions of the world. The
problems that face us demand a calm and steady response
if financial troubles are not to spill over into wider
instability. This presents a direct challenge to us all, and
a test of the component parts of the multilateral system.
This year we mark 50-year milestones in two major
areas of United Nations work, two areas that distinguish
this half-century from earlier times: international
peacekeeping and the development of international human
rights law. Both have a part to play in responding to the
challenges of the present day. Both typify the unique
contribution of the United Nations system. It is in this
global setting that universal international norms can be
established. The international rule of law gives us a
framework with which to deal confidently with the
7


problems that confront us. And it is through collective
security that the countries of the world can work together
to promote and reinforce peace and stability.
New Zealand, as a small country, has from the outset
valued the opportunities for global debate and collective
action provided by the United Nations. We are committed
to the strengthening of that system. We believe its effective
operation is essential to the well-being of our world.
We are, of course, as many are, conscious of the
criticisms that have been levelled at the United Nations in
recent years. Ten years ago the United Nations stock was
very high. The end of the cold war was seen as heralding
a new age. In 1988 the United Nations peacekeeping forces
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At the turn of the
decade there was talk of a new world order.
But the world community?s expectations of what could
be achieved sometimes exceeded Member States? own
political will to deliver. And the United Nations machinery,
which had grown and expanded to meet world expectations,
proved too cumbersome — and often very costly — to
respond effectively.
Euphoria about the United Nations began to give way
to cynicism. One editorial writer this year referred to the
United Nations as “a busted flush”. But when we take a
longer view it is clear that neither euphoria nor cynicism is
the appropriate reaction.
Since the end of the cold war the United Nations
peacekeeping machinery has been used as never before.
There have been some marked successes and, regrettably,
some failures. Much has been learned. Future peacekeeping
mandates must reflect the lessons learned.
The need for the United Nations to be able to carry
out its peacekeeping role remains. Its successes point to
what it can achieve. But today fewer troops are wearing the
blue beret, and troop-contributing countries do not receive
timely reimbursement.
The largest contributor?s arrears in peacekeeping and
the regular budget cast a long shadow over the
Organization. Dues outstanding at present have reached
alarming proportions. This affects all — large nations and
small nations.
We cannot afford to have the capacity of the United
Nations restricted by this constant budget uncertainty.
In my own area of the South Pacific we developed
a regional response to a regional problem. I am referring
to the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, an
island which was ravaged by civil war for nine years but
has enjoyed peace for the last 12 months. It was the
Governments of the region that set out to help the
Government of Papua New Guinea and representatives of
the Bougainville people to bring this horror to an end.
The contributions of Australia, Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon
Islands and my own country have played a valuable and
significant role, and there is now growing hope and
confidence on Bougainville — rare commodities for
almost a decade. The Lincoln Agreement, signed in
Christchurch, New Zealand, in January, while formalizing
the ceasefire, paved the way also for United Nations
participation. We welcomed the United Nations decision
to set up a small political office on the island. This
commitment by the United Nations will help strengthen
the peace process there.
Today the world faces uncertainty caused by the
financial turmoil which began in Asia. It is affecting the
Russian Federation, is putting many countries in Latin
America under pressure and is now touching just about
everybody. The sudden plunge in investor confidence and
the reversal of developing markets? short capital flows has
dramatically changed economic and social prospects.
World economic growth this year will be significantly
reduced.
This most serious economic situation in many years
has the potential to intrude upon all of our lives. We must
cooperate to turn this crisis around. And at the national
level we must take the actions required, not just for our
own sakes but in the interests of the broader international
community. This includes refraining from protectionist
reactions, which could only exacerbate it, and pushing
ahead with liberalization of markets wherever possible.
A serious challenge is to ensure that economic
insecurity does not threaten political and social stability.
We must resist pressures to take political actions that we
would normally avoid. The best way to achieve this is
through a collective approach to the problems that
confront us; to strengthen our multilateral institutions in
the United Nations system and elsewhere and build
confidence in our joint ability to work through difficult
times.
I was particularly struck by the comments of the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on these matters in
his statement on Monday. His characterization of the
8


crisis — that it is not just financial or economic or social
or political, but all of these things at once — is exactly
right. I thoroughly endorse the Secretary-General?s
conclusion that we must address the crisis on all these
fronts.
As a forum for debate, and as a body capable of
taking global action, the United Nations, together with its
specialized agencies, has an important role to play in
building capacity and providing social support where it is
needed. Much of what the United Nations has achieved
provides the norms and mechanisms to help us through
difficult times of the sort we are facing right now. The
challenge for the Organization is to act decisively to tackle
the problems that have the potential to undermine our
security, problems that have their greatest impact on
ordinary people in developing countries. Now is not the
time to go backwards.
Recent tragic events in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
have underlined that the fight against terrorism is far from
over. The response to terrorism must be decisive and
unequivocal. The international community has a duty to
ensure that there are no safe havens for terrorist groups.
Universal commitment to the network of anti-terrorist
instruments must be a fundamental objective of all
Members of this Organization.
War crimes and crimes against humanity have seen a
resurgence in this last part of the twentieth century. New
Zealand supports the work of the ad hoc war crimes
Tribunals in bringing criminals to justice. But this is not
enough. New Zealand has long called for an international
criminal court that would have jurisdiction over such
crimes. We commend the effort of those who, through
much hard work, dedication and compromise, enabled the
Statute for the International Criminal Court to be adopted.
It is our expectation that, with the support of the
international community, the Court will prove an effective
tool in the fight against those who carry out appalling
atrocities.
Nowhere is the need for multilateral action more
clearly obvious than in our efforts to halt environmental
degradation and promote sustainable development.
New Zealand is honoured to have our own
Environment Minister, the Honourable Simon Upton, chair
the Commission on Sustainable Development for its seventh
session. It is our strong hope that this session will see us
advance Agenda 21, and take further steps towards
achieving the goals set at the Rio Earth Summit six years
ago. It is appropriate that in the United Nations Year of
the Ocean the session?s themes will include oceans and
seas and the review of the Barbados Programme of
Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States in preparation for next year?s special
session of the General Assembly.
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted last
December was a positive first step in dealing with this
quintessentially global problem. There remain some
important implementation issues to be resolved. The
Fourth Congress of the parties in Buenos Aires will
provide an opportunity to make further progress.
Thanks to the commitment of the Secretary-General,
we now have an Organization that is efficient and
effective. There is more to be done if this great
Organization is to meet the challenges of the present day:
changes that make it possible to redirect efforts from the
administration of the Organization to its front-line work
in development and confronting global problems.
New Zealand looks forward to continuing the
dialogue on financing for development. Through our
current membership of the Economic and Social Council
we have followed closely the evolving debate on this very
important issue. We very much welcome the initiatives
taken by the Organization towards closer linkages with
the Bretton Woods Institutions. Those institutions are
themselves at the forefront of the effort to tackle the
present economic crisis, probably the greatest challenge
they have ever had. However, we must decide whether in
their present form they are appropriate for the twenty-first
century.
This Organization, too, like any other, needs to
respond to changing circumstances, and be flexible
enough to meet new challenges. It must reflect the world
of today, not stay fixed in the patterns of earlier times.
The East-West conflict is well behind us. We now need
to address anew the divide between North and South. The
United Nations development role is crucial. Once again I
believe the Secretary-General hit the nail on the head
when he described in his statement on Monday the need
to restore development to its proper place in global
economic strategy. Also essential are measures to free up
trade and investment flows, and promote access to
information and technology. All of these are tools with
which to fight the economic downturn which is
confronting us.
9


The United Nations clearly has the leading role to play
in development. Other international institutions play a
complementary part. I am personally conscious of the
particular contribution made by the Commonwealth through
the recent Commonwealth Small States Mission. That
Mission highlighted the special vulnerability of small
States, which has led to the establishment of the
Commonwealth/World Bank task force on the issue which
will have relevance to the work of the Economic and Social
Council and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) on the question of vulnerability.
Within the United Nations we need to correct the
North-South imbalance to which I referred through reform
of the Security Council. More equitable representation on
the Council would better reflect the world as it is and
today?s United Nations. Expansion is proving a complex
issue, but there has been some good progress this year in
the equally important area of reforming the Council?s
working methods. Altogether, these are matters which
require careful consideration and negotiation. Setting
artificial deadlines ahead of general agreement on a reform
package would not be helpful and could in fact prove
damaging to the Organization. Any reforms must enjoy the
support of the greatest possible number of Member States.
I should add that regional groups in the United
Nations still reflect an earlier era. New Zealand is certainly
open to new ideas on how groupings can be reorganized to
create a more equitable distribution of electoral
opportunities and to recognize modern-day political and
economic linkages.
In the field of disarmament and arms control, it is
timely to consider how far we have come and what we
have achieved. The adoption of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996 certainly promised the end
of nuclear testing. But the global non-proliferation norm
was shattered by the nuclear testing in South Asia, raising
grave fears of a potential arms race. New Zealand has taken
some encouragement from statements made in this Hall in
recent days, and hopes that 1999 will be the year in which
all countries that have not yet done so will sign up
unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty.
The Conference on Disarmament has now agreed to
proceed with negotiations on a fissile material cut-off
treaty. New Zealand wants to see those negotiations
concluded as soon as possible. There must be no stepping
back from the objective of complete disarmament, including
the elimination of nuclear weapons. New Zealand?s
commitment to this objective was reiterated in the
declaration which I, together with the Foreign Ministers
of seven other countries, issued on 9 June. New Zealand
is now working with those countries on a draft resolution
based on the concerns outlined in the declaration.
One achievement which I personally see as a top
priority for 1999 is the conclusion of a verification
protocol to the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
Their Destruction. Following a very successful initiative
from Australia, I was pleased to chair a group of
ministers who this week issued a statement urging
Governments to commit themselves to completing this
task.
New Zealand supports the actions of the United
Nations to ensure the elimination of Iraq?s stockpiles of
weapons of mass destruction and the threat they pose to
the security of the region. We urge the Government of
Iraq to resume cooperation with the United Nations
Special Commission so that the elimination of these
dreadful weapons can be confirmed. Then the Security
Council can once more address the question of lifting
sanctions.
In the 50 years since Member States adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the significance
of the Declaration has been demonstrated time and time
again. Yet there remains much to be done before the
vision in the Charter and in the Declaration can be
realized for all. We are confident that, under the
leadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
we will continue to make good progress towards the
realization of that vision.
The United Nations can add value in promoting and
protecting fundamental human rights standards,
emphasizing practical capacity-building efforts. We have
been supporting the High Commissioner?s efforts in this
area, and we will continue to do so.
We see countries in all regions of the world seeking
the international community?s support as they build
structures to provide good governance and deliver hope
and greater well-being to their people. In particular, I am
encouraged by developments in Nigeria and in Sierra
Leone in this regard.
As the last 50 years have demonstrated, this
Organization has added a whole new dimension to
10


cooperation among nations. No lesser body could have
achieved so much. In the longer perspective of history it
will be the dramatic development of the international rule
of law and the evolution of collective approaches to
security, both political and economic, which will
characterize our era. In other words, that really is the work
of the United Nations.
Now, with the challenge of the economic problems
that face us, we nations of the world are more dependent
than ever on solving our shared problems together. New
Zealand therefore rededicates itself to the United Nations
and to the ideals that this Organization stands for.









"
4264,53,1998,PNG,"On behalf of the
people and the Government of Papua New Guinea, I wish
to join previous speakers in congratulating you,
Mr. President, on your election to your important post.
Your unanimous election as President of the General
Assembly shows the esteem in which the international
community holds both you, personally, and your country,
Uruguay. The Papua New Guinea delegation is confident
that you will guide this fifty-third session of the General
Assembly to a successful conclusion.
May I also take this opportunity, through you, to
express my delegationâs sincere appreciation to your
predecessor, the former Foreign Minister of Ukraine,
Mr. Hennadiy Udovenko, for his outstanding stewardship
in facilitating the work of the fifty-second session of the
General Assembly.
We would also like to place on record our
appreciation to the Secretary-General and the Secretariat
staff for the care they put into the planning of the affairs
of our Organization.
This is the first occasion on which I have addressed
the General Assembly. The year since I was elected
Prime Minister has been a year of great challenge in
which my Government has been confronted with
problems associated with natural disasters and those that
have resulted from many years of neglect.
The realities of life in the rapidly shrinking world
mean that a partnership must, in practice, be turned into
something practical and viewed in a much broader global
perspective as an element of a worldwide partnership in
managing and, where possible, directing change.
The point is brought home by a series of natural
disasters which have affected Papua New Guinea over the
past year. First came the drought caused by the El NiÃ±o
effect, and then followed frosts, which led to severe food
shortages in many different parts of the country. Then
came the tsunami which completely destroyed villages in
the Aitape area of the Sandaun province on the north
coast of the mainland, killing more than 2,100 people,
mainly children and women, and injuring many more. In
between came floods and landslides, which caused death
and destruction in several places. Meanwhile, people
11


around Rabaul continue to cope with the effects and try to
rebuild in the aftermath of the 1994 volcanic eruptions.
The drought, in particular, showed that people and
States throughout the world have to be partners in dealing
with the causes of disasters arising from climatic or other
forms of environmental change. The prompt and generous
response to the series of natural disasters by our neighbours
and friends in many different countries showed that they
are truly our partners in dealing with the effects of such
changes.
Like other developing countries, Papua New Guinea
faces the challenge of providing its people with
opportunities to improve both the material standard of
living and the quality of life. My Government has had to
address these multiple changes while dealing with natural
disasters and carrying out a comprehensive programme of
structural adjustment.
In doing so, we are working hard to make sure that
private initiative contributes to public welfare and national
development, as it can and should, by focusing on trimming
the public sector so that State resources are used where
they can be most effective.
The result has been a stable economy with continuing
economic growth. It has been achieved and is being
maintained despite the negative impact on trade and
investment prospects arising from the economic crisis
affecting so many of our East Asian neighbours.
The lesson we draw from the experience is that the
world is truly becoming a global community. The challenge
we face is to develop a global partnership â€” strong,
focused, and determined enough to manage and, where
possible, to direct change. The lesson has obvious
implications for a world in which some countries
experience â€œaid fatigueâ€, while increasing numbers of
people elsewhere fall and remain below the poverty line,
where survival itself is the most pressing issue.
I know that with its small, open economy, my
countryâs development is directly influenced by
developments in world markets for our products. Currently,
my country is suffering from the economic crisis
experienced by our major trading partners, in which we are
forced to undertake significant reform programmes to
protect our economy and our people.
In this regard, we turn our attention to international
financial institutions to help us restructure our economy.
Unfortunately, we have had mixed reactions from them.
Some of them, including the International Monetary Fund
and the Asian Development Bank, have been very
positive in their discussions with us, while others appear
to be slow in responding. This leads me to think that
sometimes some of these organizations are insensitive and
do not appreciate the difficulties and hardships faced by
our people without their help.
This year, despite the El NiÃ±o drought and other
natural disasters that devastated my country, Papua New
Guinea, we have continued to become more vigilant to
these challenges and to take remedial measures.
Notwithstanding the hardship our economy is
experiencing because of the international economic crisis,
the value of our currency has consistently been
recovering. For Papua New Guinea to realize and sustain
its current reform programmes, it has to secure external
financial support.
The challenge is to forge a new global partnership
for change â€” a partnership in which both developed and
developing countries join together to address the issues
that the global community will face in the twenty-first
century. This partnership will be necessary if the shared
hopes of humanity for peace, justice and a better way of
life are to progress.
I see my Governmentâs foreign policy of partnership
in the Asia-Pacific as a building block for the global
partnership on which the future depends. For developing
countries in particular, there is really no alternative way.
In facing the challenge of improving both the
material standards of living and the quality of life of our
people, we are carrying out comprehensive programmes
of structural adjustment and changing our focus so that
both private and State resources can be directed to social
welfare and national development. Despite the negative
effects of the current global crisis, we are achieving a
stable economy, stabilizing our currency and attracting
investments.
When my Government came into office in July
1997, my priority was the resolution of the nine-year-old
Bougainville conflict, which had caused terrible suffering
and the loss of lives and property. Three factors â€” the
desire of the men and especially the women of
Bougainville to end the fighting, my desire for a
consensus resolution and the moral and practical support
of Australia and New Zealand â€” led to a meeting in
12


Burnham, New Zealand, in October 1997 where a truce was
signed.
As an integral part of the truce, my Government
approached our friends in the region to form an unarmed
and neutral regional Truce Monitoring Group. The
Government of the Solomon Islands â€” which played a
very constructive role in the processes â€” New Zealand,
Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu provided personnel to the Truce
Monitoring Group, and its presence helped mutual
confidence-building and made people feel safe.
The peace monitoring group that took over on 1 May
this year continues to provide a positive role in maintaining
and consolidating peace. In March this year, I met in
Lincoln, New Zealand, with the main Bougainvillean parties
involved in the conflict, and we agreed that a permanent
and irrevocable ceasefire should take effect from 30 April
1998. Proceeding on a bipartisan-national basis and in close
consultation with all of the major Bougainville parties, I
agreed that the State would approach the Security Council
to endorse the Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and
Development on Bougainville. I also requested that the
Council send a small observer mission to monitor and
report on developments.
As the internationally recognized representatives of all
of the people of Papua New Guinea and being proud of
Papua New Guineaâs independence and sovereignty, we
made these requests with mixed feelings, but with
determination made strong by our faith in the cause of
peace.
I am pleased to report that the Security Council
responded positively to our request, and, through the efforts
of other South Pacific Forum missions in New York and
others in close cooperation with the Secretary-General, the
Observer Mission is now on Bougainville, operating side by
side with the personnel of the peacekeeping mission.
As I speak, my Government is making arrangements
for a Bougainville restoration Government to take office
within the framework of our Constitution before the end of
this year. At the same time, the people and leaders of
Bougainville are performing the traditional ceremonies of
reconciliation.
Our partners from Australia, New Zealand, the
European Union, Japan and the United Nations
Development Programme are providing resources for
restoration and development. A number of non-
governmental organizations, including churches, the Red
Cross and Doctors Without Frontiers are also active. My
Government is taking practical steps to strengthen civil
authority by training Bougainvillean policemen to work in
Bougainville.
Having begun the processes of peace in
Bougainville, we must now do everything we can to make
peace work through peaceful means. While the peace
process on Bougainville is still fragile, my Government is
confident that with the support of all Papua New
Guineans and of our neighbours and friends in the
international community, it will continue to gain strength.
As it gains strength, we expect direct international
involvement to become of less importance, decreasing by
agreement as mutual confidence and trust consolidates.
The Bougainville peace process has shown in a practical
and constructive manner how people can seek
reconciliation and forgiveness.
The Security Council, together with the Secretary-
General, have given both moral, and through the Observer
Mission, visible and practical support.
On a separate though broadly related matter, Papua
New Guinea commends the United Nations on 50 years
of cooperation in international peacekeeping and reaffirms
its commitment to these processes. Papua New Guinea
makes a resolute commitment to the principles and
purposes of the United Nations Charter. In doing so, we
recognize that like any other institution, the United
Nations has limitations. Consistent with our view of the
United Nations as a means of promoting global
cooperation and partnership to meet the challenges of
change in the twenty-first century, Papua New Guinea
continues in its strong belief that its moral values and
organizations offer hope to humanity.
Consistent with our commitment to the United
Nations, my Government is actively engaged in bringing
our national laws, policies and practices into line with the
important declarations and plans of action produced by
the United Nations. We give priority to implementing
United Nations declarations and plans of action to
advance the rights of women and the elimination of child
abuse.
In common with the other Member countries, we
believe that it is timely to bring the United Nations
Charter into line with contemporary reality by eliminating
references to â€œenemy Statesâ€. Papua New Guinea strongly
supports calls for a new Security Council for the new
millennium.
13


As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, we
endorse the Declaration issued by its thirteenth Summit,
held in Durban, South Africa.
The Security Council should be reformed and
expanded. An effective Security Council should be of a size
and composition which matches the enhanced role that the
world expects it to play in coordinating global approaches
and actions directed to deal with the issues we will all face
in the twenty-first century. Consistent with the mutual
respect and equity on which partnership must be based,
Papua New Guinea believes that all permanent members of
the Security Council should have similar privileges and
rights.
Changing the world from a system of relations
between imperial Powers to a partnership between
sovereign States through decolonization is among the
United Nations greatest achievements. The process will not
be completed, as it must be, until the remaining 17
dependent territories have exercised their inalienable right
to self-determination. Neither small size nor remoteness
should be allowed to qualify or limit their rights. The
recently concluded South Pacific Forum, held in Pohnpei in
the Federated States of Micronesia, has confirmed its
support for that right.
As one of the States which has always taken a close
interest in the situation and in the rights of the indigenous
Kanaks of New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea is pleased
to note the progress made in implementing the Matignon
Accords, culminating in the recent Agreement to the
Noumea Accord.
The Noumea Accord will, we believe, provide a sound
basis for the future fulfilment of all legitimate political
aspirations. We urge all parties to honour both its letter and
its spirit. The United Nations should continue to monitor
developments in New Caledonia until implementation is
complete and self-determination has been achieved.
More than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans live in
rural villages, where they depend directly on the land,
rivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood. Our national
Constitution commits us to use and develop the rich variety
of the countryâs natural resources for the common good and
the benefit of future generations. In doing so, it upholds the
most up-to-date principles of international environmental
law. The same provisions also provide a sound basis for
domestic policy and law-making.
Papua New Guinea has spoken out strongly and
worked actively on a wide range of environmental issues.
Consistent with our record and ongoing commitment, my
Government will shortly be signing and then ratifying the
Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. In line with the
importance we attach to such matters, Papua New Guinea
is party to conventions arising out of the Rio Summit on
environment and development and Agenda 21. My
Government will continue to follow and support the
future work of the Commission, including efforts to
translate and integrate internationally agreed objectives
and standards into domestic laws and programmes of
action.
Like other members of the South Pacific Forum,
Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to the Barbados
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of
Small Island States. We strongly urge its full
implementation. Together with other States in the region,
we have joined as partners with distant-water-fishing
nations to develop a programme to manage the
sustainable use of tuna stocks in the western and central
Pacific.
The worldâs leading scientists have concluded that
the rise in global temperatures poses serious threats, such
as sea-level rise and an increase in natural catastrophes,
such as the El NiÃ±o phenomenon.
Papua New Guinea, together with the small island
States in the Pacific, will continue to stress the urgency
for developed countries to take a strong lead in the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
The Kyoto Protocol has paved the way for annex I
countries to fulfil their commitments under the
Convention on Climate Change and the Protocol itself.
We urge those parties to translate their legally binding
targets for the reduction of their emissions into concrete
action. While it is our firm conviction that there must be
a global approach, we cannot support shifting the burden
to developing countries as a precondition for the
ratification of the Protocol.
At the recent South Pacific Forum meeting, our
Government, together with other heads of the South
Pacific region, confirmed our support for the South
Pacific Environmental Programme and the Forum
Fisheries Agency (FFA) as a key sector. The FFA
programme will ensure the maintenance of sustainable
fisheries in the region as well as enhance the economic
14


security of coastal States, particularly those economies
which are highly dependent on this one resource.
This is the International Year of the Ocean. Papua
New Guinea will work actively with other South Pacific
Missions in New York to commemorate this Year, with
particular emphasis on the sustainable use of resources
derived from the oceans.
With its recent share of national disasters, some of
which have taken the ultimate human toll, Papua New
Guinea is concerned about climate change, rising sea levels
and the urgent need to reduce carbon and other emissions
in the atmosphere. Having experienced natural disasters at
first hand, I would say that the greatest challenge for the
United Nations is to strengthen the global communityâs
capacity to respond promptly and effectively to natural
disasters. I am sure that my friends from China and
Bangladesh, where large areas have recently been
devastated by floods, would agree. Papua New Guinea
strongly supports the renewal of the International Decade
for Natural Disaster Reduction and preparedness and the
Yokohama Strategy adopted in 1993.
Consistent with our shared commitment to a stable,
peaceful and environmentally safe world, my Government
supports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We support efforts to ban
transboundary movements of radioactive and other
hazardous wastes in and through our region and to ensure
that damage arising from nuclear explosions is adequately
compensated.
Together with our partners in the South Pacific Forum,
we recently reaffirmed our determination to maintain the
South Pacific as a nuclear-free zone. We also expressed our
support for the other regional nuclear-free zones, in Africa,
South-East Asia and the Latin American and Caribbean
region, and the proposed new initiative in Central and
South Asia. Like people and Governments throughout the
world, we in the South Pacific were seriously concerned
about the series of nuclear weapons tests conducted by
India and Pakistan. The best course of action would be not
only to stop testing now but also to destroy all nuclear
weapons. Papua New Guinea believes that the same should
apply to all weapons of mass destruction in other parts of
the world.
Encouraged at the positive signs of progress towards
resolving conflicts and securing peace in several areas of
tension and concern in Asia and Africa, Papua New Guinea
nonetheless remains anxious over recent developments
affecting Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We are heartened by the
efforts made by the Organization of African Unity to
restore peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.
Also, we support the initiative of President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa to revive a common vision for
peace in Africa.
Consistent with our commitment to peaceful
dialogue between nations, Papua New Guinea condemns
those who employ terrorism against innocent people,
including women and children. Diplomacy is the means
by which States join together as partners and cooperate in
bringing about changes to promote peace, development
and justice for people both in principle and, even more
importantly, in practice. It is therefore vital that diplomats
be able to live and work safely, free from the threat of
terrorism, such as that practised against American
diplomats in Africa.
In this connection, following recent events on our
common border with Indonesia, my Government would
like to make clear its strong and consistent recognition of
the sovereignty of Indonesia, including Irian Jaya, and the
continuing mutual respect in all aspects of our
relationship.
In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Papua New
Guineaâs commitments to the United Nations Charter; to
the inalienable rights of the independent territories to self-
determination, noting the Matignon and Noumea accords
for the Kanak people of New Caledonia; the declaration
to advance the rights of women and eliminate child abuse;
to our determination to maintain global natural disaster
preparedness; to work actively in commemorating the
Year of the Ocean; to the ratification of the Kyoto
Protocol on global warming; and to the Barbados
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of
Small Island States.
Partnership in promoting change is the key to
addressing the challenges that the world will face in the
twenty-first century. I believe the challenge for the
Member States is to join together to change this
Organization for the better so that it will serve as an
effective basis for partnership, to address and resolve the
issues that lie ahead.

















"
4320,58,2003,PNG,"﻿Let
me from the outset congratulate the President of this
fifty-eighth General Assembly on his election. I have
no doubt that his election by the international
community is a recognition of his vast diplomatic skills
and leadership qualities. His election is also
recognition of the coming of age of small island States.
I also wish to thank his predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan for
his stewardship of the work of the fifty-seventh
General Assembly.
16

Please allow me also to pay tribute to the United
Nations Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan and his
staff for their dedication and commitment in dealing
with many pressing international issues that confront
us today.
I join others delegations in expressing our
Government’s sincere condolences to the families of
the United Nations staff, including the late Sergio
Vieira de Mello, the former United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, who lost their lives
in Baghdad on 16 August 2003.
The attacks were barbaric and against the
principles of freedom, democracy and peace as
enshrined in the United Nations Charter. They must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
In pursuit of our commitments to combat
international terrorism, I am happy to report that Papua
New Guinea has substantially complied with United
Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).
Our Parliament recently ratified many of the
conventions and protocols to combat global terrorism.
Yesterday, I personally deposited four conventions with
the Office of the United Nations Secretary-General.
Having fulfilled these requirements, Papua New
Guinea is now faced with resource constraints and
other challenges to implementing the treaty
obligations. This situation is further exacerbated by
other threats, such as illicit drug trafficking,
proliferation of small arms and light weapons,
smuggling of humans and money-laundering.
In the Pacific Islands region, we have taken
positive initiatives to collectively deal with these
threats. The Nasonini and Biketawa Declarations
agreed to by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders provide
the framework for cooperation in dealing with these
threats.
In the wider Asia/Pacific Region, the Southwest
Pacific Dialogue has met twice, in addition to the
annual Bali security meetings, to discuss political and
security issues facing the region. The Dialogue partners
include Indonesia, the Philippines, New Zealand,
Australia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea.
Whilst issues of greater political and security
risks are of concern to us, the real threat at this stage is
the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.
Small arms and light weapons have not only
destabilized regions, sparked, fuelled and prolonged
conflicts but also obstructed relief programmes,
undermined peace initiatives, exacerbated human rights
abuses, hampered development and fostered a culture
of violence. There are no international treaties or other
legal instruments for dealing effectively with this
category of weapons.
In this context, Papua New Guinea welcomes the
call for the immediate and full implementation of the
2001 Plan of Action on small arms aimed at curbing
and eradicating the flow of small arms and light
weapons.
Let me place this in the context of the crisis in
our province of Bougainville where the proliferation of
small arms and light weapons contributed to the
prolonging of the conflict in the province.
With regard to progress in Bougainville, we have
completed the second stage of the arms disposal
programme, which has been verified by the United
Nations. The regional Peace Monitoring Group (PMG)
has now been wound down and replaced by the
Bougainville Transition Team (BTT). With the help of
the United Nations the Team will maintain logistical
support for the peace process and assist in other
operational areas.
I would also like to inform this Assembly that the
peace process under the Bougainville Agreement has
reached the crucial third stage under the constitutional
amendments agreed to by the Papua New Guinea
National Parliament. While there are delays, every
necessary step is being taken by all parties concerned
to ensure that the momentum built to date is not being
unduly hampered.
My Government therefore seeks the
understanding of the international community,
especially the members of the Security Council, to help
us fully achieve all tasks agreed to under the
Bougainville Peace Agreement. This will signal a win-
win story for all, the United Nations, our Government
and the people of Bougainville.
I express our Government’s profound
appreciation to the Secretary-General for the invaluable
efforts of the United Nations Political Office in
Bougainville (UNPOB), including those of
Ambassador Noel Sinclair.
I also acknowledge and thank our regional
neighbours — Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Solomon
17

Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, for their immense
contribution to the peace process.
With regard to the conflict in the Solomon
Islands, the package of assistance developed and
agreed to by the Pacific Islands foreign ministers and
later adopted at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders
meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, last month has
helped restore peace and normalcy in that country. It
was undertaken at the request of the Government of the
Solomon Islands under the Biketawa Declaration.
The Australian-led operation includes the
deployment of both civilian police and armed
peacekeepers from many of the Pacific island member
States, including my own. The cooperation among
member States underlines the strength of regional
peacekeeping, if done properly.
On the Israeli and Palestinian issue, we were
encouraged by the general positive signs of progress
towards resolving and securing peace based on the
United States-led road map. However, this has
deteriorated in recent weeks. We call upon all parties
involved to exercise maximum restraint and work
towards the peaceful settlement of this crisis.
We are pleased that the Quartet has recently
convened in New York to review the road map. We
look forward to their strong leadership in assisting to
resolve this long outstanding issue. Fighting and
violence will not resolve the conflict. We join the
international community’s call for both the Israeli and
Palestinian leadership to make renewed efforts at the
negotiating table, to cease all hostilities by both sides
and to find a permanent solution to the problem.
Our belief is that diplomacy is the only means by
which States may join as partners and co-operate in
bringing about changes which promote peace,
economic and social progress for all people, both in
principle and, more importantly, in practice.
We believe that this too should apply to the
situation in Iraq. We support the work being done in
the Security Council to adopt a new resolution on a
role of the United Nations that would provide a
framework for the widest possible participation of
United Nations Member States in the reconstruction of
Iraq.
Regarding United Nations reforms, Papua New
Guinea commends the leadership demonstrated by the
Secretary-General in the current work being done to
reform the main organs of the United Nations, the
General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies and the
Security Council.
We support the expansion of the Security Council
in both permanent and non-permanent membership
categories. Reforms should take into account the
interests of both developed and developing countries.
All permanent members in an expanded Council
should have similar rights and privileges. However, the
use of the veto power should be curtailed and applied
only to Chapter VII issues. In doing so, we must move
swiftly to complete the reforms of the United Nations
system — including the Security Council — so we can
restore the capacity of the multilateral system to better
serve us all.
Papua New Guinea fully endorses the recent
Declarations and Plans of Action of the Doha,
Monterrey and Johannesburg Conferences. We are
resolved to meet the challenges of poverty eradication;
hunger; illiteracy; environmental degradation; climate
change; and HIV/AIDS, malaria and other preventable
diseases. We are also committed to addressing issues of
good governance. It is the desire of the Government of
Papua New Guinea to incorporate the Millennium
Development Goals into our national development
priorities. We are in the process of adopting the
medium-term development strategy, which is aimed at
redirecting development to the rural areas where the
majority of our people live. We encourage the
international community — including all stakeholders
in developed and developing countries — to continue
to make resources available to fully implement those
Declarations and Plans of Action.
Like other developing member States of the
Pacific Islands Forum, Papua New Guinea is firmly
committed to the Barbados Programme of Action for
the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States. We fully support its 10-year review
process, which will take place at the international
meeting to be held in Mauritius in August 2004. We
call upon our regional and international development
partners to support the review process, as was the case
with the recent conferences of the least developed and
landlocked developing countries.
The recent breakdown in the World Trade
Organization negotiations in Cancún is of great
concern to us all. However, that should not be a barrier
to further negotiations to arrive at a fair and equitable
18

arrangement that provides for the interests of all
nations.
On a more targeted front, the African, Caribbean
and Pacific (ACP) group of countries — of which
Papua New Guinea is a member — are now negotiating
with the European Union for a possible economic
partnership agreement. It is important that the main
objective be the eradication of poverty, and therefore
that trade preferences enjoyed by ACP countries under
successive Lomé Conventions and under the current
Cotonou Agreements not be eroded.
The small island developing States of the Pacific
region are among the custodians of the largest ocean
space. The Pacific Ocean is rich in natural marine
resources. The recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders
Meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, again reaffirmed
the Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy, which aims
to ensure the future sustainable use of our oceans and
their resources by our island communities, in close
cooperation with our development partners.
The countries of the region, however, have
limited human, financial and technological capacities
to control, manage and secure those resources for the
benefit of our current and future generations. In
protecting our vast marine resources, the Pacific
Islands Forum leaders reiterate their serious concerns
about the shipment of radioactive materials through the
region. They also call upon States engaged in those
activities to accept full responsibility and liability for
compensation for any damage that may result, directly
or indirectly, from the transportation of radioactive
material through the region. The two accidents that
happened in the Atlantic Ocean last year underline the
reality of our concerns.
Papua New Guinea, together with other small
island developing States, continues to express deep
concerns about the adverse impact of climate change,
climate variability and sea-level rise, particularly on
the small, low-lying islands that are already
experiencing extreme hardships. We will continue to
stress the urgent need for developed countries to exert
strong leadership in the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions.
Papua New Guinea has signed and ratified both
the United Nations Climate Change Convention and the
Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol paves the way
forward for developed countries to fulfil their
obligations under the Climate Change Convention. We
believe that the larger developing countries also have
an obligation to take concrete actions in reducing their
gas emissions. We welcome the support of Japan, the
European Community and China for the Kyoto
Protocol. We urge the United States, the Russian
Federation and Australia to join the global efforts
aimed at addressing that issue, including ratification of
the Kyoto Protocol.
Papua New Guinea is also not immune to the
HIV/AIDS pandemic. Tuberculosis and malaria are
again on the rise, so there is an urgent need to find
preventive measures for those diseases. I am, however,
pleased to report that the Papua New Guinea
Parliament this year enacted legislation aimed at
dealing with the scourge by assisting with prevention
and awareness programmes to reduce and limit the
spread of HIV/AIDS, which threatens the lives of our
people, particularly mothers and children. In that
regard, we thank Australia for its substantial assistance.
We also acknowledge continuing support from other
development partners, including the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health
Organization.
We also support the work of the United Nations
in relation to the protection and advancement of the
rights of women and children. While we have ratified
the appropriate conventions, we realize that we must do
more. We acknowledge the support being provided by
our development partners, including United Nations
agencies such as the United Nations Development
Programme and UNICEF.
Papua New Guinea fully concurs with the calls by
the international community to reform and restructure
the charters and mandates of the two Bretton Woods
institutions. Their lending policies should be made
more lenient and flexible with regard to assisting
developing countries in their developmental efforts.
Among the greatest achievements of the United
Nations is the process of decolonization. But that
process will not be completed — as it must be — until
the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories have
exercised their inalienable right to self-determination.
The United Nations should continue to monitor
developments in New Caledonia, Tokelau and the other
14 Non-Self-Governing Territories on the United
Nations decolonization list on a case-by-case basis.
Neither size, remoteness nor population density should
19

be allowed to limit the exercise of this inalienable
right. The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting held
in Auckland last month once again reaffirmed its
support for that principle.
In conclusion, I want to reaffirm Papua New
Guinea’s firm commitment to the timeless principles
enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We also
strongly advocate that it is Papua New Guinea’s
position that diplomacy, through positive dialogue, is
the key to addressing these challenges.
Finally, Papua New Guinea believes that a greater
challenge for all United Nations Member States is to
work together as genuine partners. That will serve as
an effective tool for implementing our collective goal:
to create a better and more secure world, both today
and for future generations.





"
4364,58,2003,NRU,"﻿It gives me great
pleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of His
Excellency Rene Harris, President and Minister for
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nauru, who had to
cancel his trip to New York at the last minute due to
pressing matters at home. President Harris has asked
me to convey to Mr. Julian Hunte warmest
congratulations on his assumption of the stewardship of
the Assembly. As a small island developing State,
Nauru is extremely proud to be associated with the
Caribbean Community on Mr. Hunte’s marvellous
achievement, which gives us hope that we in the
Pacific will also have the opportunity to preside over
the Assembly.
My delegation would like, through him, to
commend His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, President of
the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, for
his excellent leadership and the great efforts that he
made, particularly in tackling the difficult issues that
have plagued the revitalization of the General
Assembly as the premier organ of the United Nations.
The President has pledged to continue the good work
that has been done in these areas, and he can count on
Nauru’s full cooperation.
Peace and security — or, more correctly, the lack
of it — is still the main focus of the United Nations 58
years after its inception. In the past 24 months, we have
seen the internationalization of terrorism manifest itself
out of a cocktail of hatred, desperation and fanaticism
that has spread its tentacles from the Middle East into
the international arena. It is unconventional,
clandestine, and indiscriminate with respect to its
victims. We are also seeing an increase in the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction after a
period of relative calm, and this is further exacerbating
the situation.
The sum of these two nightmarish threats is a
cause for concern, and States that feel uniquely
vulnerable to terrorist acts are considering the real
possibility of terrorists gaining access to weapons of
mass destruction. That scenario has forced such States
to develop the antidote of unilateral action primed with
a pre-emptive strike policy.
We saw it in action in Afghanistan and, six
months ago in Iraq, just as President Bush said we
would if the Security Council failed to walk the talk of
resolution 1441 (2002), which called for the
disarmament by Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction. Nauru is disappointed that President Bush
did not refer in his statement last week to the status of
the coalition’s search for stockpiles of these weapons,
and we are puzzled as to why it is hard to find them
when intelligence indicated that the Iraqis could arm
and unleash them so as to hit the United Kingdom
within 45 minutes.
My delegation considers the antidote to which I
referred to be the catalyst in the new wave of nuclear
weapons proliferation, and it is not a coincidence that
the countries singled out as part of the “axis of evil”
are being accused of developing nuclear weapons.
Nauru joins the appeal to the countries concerned to
observe their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to allow the
International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out
inspections and verify that nuclear weapons are not
being developed.
In all of this, we are certain of one thing: that the
major casualty of the current state of affairs is the
innocence of the United Nations, which was mortally
wounded in Baghdad when the lives of 22 dedicated
United Nations servants were lost, including that of the
22

revered Sergio Vieira de Mello, and more than 100
were injured.
The people of Nauru join the United Nations
family in mourning the victims of that tragedy, and our
heartfelt condolences go to the bereaved families. That
despicable act of terror has cast a shadow over the
safety and security of United Nations personnel
everywhere. The clarity of its emblem, which stood for
tolerance, hope and impartiality and which had acted as
a shield against attack, may have been blurred by its
subservient role to the administering force in Iraq.
In the light of the facts before us, Nauru fully
agrees with the assessment made by the Secretary-
General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in his bold and gutsy
statement that the Organization has “come to a fork in
the road” and that we are in a moment of time that is
“no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United
Nations was founded.” (A/58/PV.7, p. 3)
Nauru fully supports the proposal to establish a
high-level panel of eminent personalities to review
threats to peace and security and other global
challenges insofar as these may influence or be
connected with such threats. Nauru strongly believes in
multilateralism as a key tool in resolving contemporary
problems in all of their complexity.
The Security Council should be at the centre of
our collective efforts in maintaining peace and
resolving conflict. At the same time, the Council must
have at its disposal the means of making evaluations
and taking collective action. Most importantly, it must
have the will to act quickly and decisively, not only to
threats to peace and security, but to genocide and other
massive violations of human rights.
Nauru is pleased to see the rapid progression
towards making the International Criminal Court
operational since its Statute came into force in July
2001. We believe that the objectives of the Court make
it a useful addition to the international tool kit for the
preservation of peace, as perpetrators of atrocious acts
in armed conflict have been put on notice that they will
be held accountable for their acts or omissions.
As a small island developing State in the Pacific
Ocean, Nauru aligns itself with the statements of the
leaders of the Pacific nations who have spoken before
me on the concerns and challenges that we, the small-
island-big-ocean developing States are facing, now and
in the future. Nauru bears all the unique characteristics
of a small island State, given our small size, in terms of
both land area and population, our remoteness and our
vulnerability to exogenous forces, be they man-made or
natural.
In 1994, the world community agreed that small
island developing States warranted special
consideration with regard to their economic and social
development because of the unique set of
characteristics that are inherent in each island country,
and it was to address those unique problems that the
Barbados Plan of Action was created.
As His Royal Highness the Prime Minister of
Tonga stated in his intervention, the road to sustainable
development for small island developing States is
posted with signs of undertakings, as we marched from
Barbados in 1994 to New York in 1999 for the five-
year review, then on to Monterrey in 2002 for the
International Conference on Financing for
Development, where more signs were posted saying
that internal self-help, good governance and trade were
the key to poverty alleviation, and that subscription to
those cures would provide the way for developed
countries to come in and help. Most, if not all, of the
small island developing States have been taking this
medicine for a long time, and we have yet to see the
doctor. In Johannesburg, a whole chapter was devoted
to the cause of the small island developing States. In
April of this year, the Commission on Sustainable
Development paved the way for an international
meeting to be held in Mauritius in 2004.
Yet despite all these signs of good intentions, the
reality is that, when small island developing States try
to see that these decisions or undertakings are reflected
in other international forums, our proposals in most
cases are either rejected or rendered impotent after
intense and difficult negotiations. The Cancún meeting
is a good example, as is the recent meeting of
Convention bodies such as the Eighth Conference of
the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change in New Delhi in 2002,
and the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, held in
Havana recently. This undesirable situation needs to be
addressed if small island developing States are to
benefit from the positive outcomes of international
meetings or review conferences.
23

As we march towards Mauritius, small island
developing States will have to endure due process in
the Second Committee and at the twelfth session of the
Commission on Sustainable Development in order to
establish administrative and financial norms for the
international meeting. My delegation suspects that
there will be many bumps and detours on the way, but
our hope is that, at the end of the road, the outcome
will focus on what needs to be done — when and by
whom — to overcome impediments in the
implementation of the Programme of Action.
It is not sufficient to rely solely on the Barbados
Programme of Action to address all the development
problems of small island developing States. To that
end, Nauru sees the Millennium Development Goals as
supplementing the Programme of Action by adding the
human development dimension to the scope of issues
that should be addressed and by offering partnership to
drive the process.
However, for small island States like Nauru, the
complex reporting requirement of the Goals is adding
to the burden of reports that we are required to prepare,
and therefore it is the considered view of my
delegation that the United Nations Development
Programme should tailor the questionnaire to suit a
group of clients rather than use a one-size-fits-all
approach. Assistance also should be provided to
countries such as Nauru to collect and process the raw
data required for the report.
Nauru, like other low-lying small island States,
sees the Kyoto Protocol as its salvation from sea-level
rise and climate change, which would devastate our
already fragile ecological system, which is essential to
our livelihood and culture. My delegation understands
that the Russian Federation now stands between the
Kyoto Protocol’s coming into force and its continuing
to languish. If that is the case, then Nauru calls on the
Russian Federation to do what is universally right and
just by ratifying the protocol before the meeting of the
Ninth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held
in Italy in December this year.
A healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable use
of its natural resources, including highly migratory fish
stocks, are also critical to our livelihood. We in the
Pacific have walked the talk on these issues through
the development of an ocean policy to guide us in the
management of our part of the Pacific Ocean and to
form the framework for future regional ocean-related
initiatives.
Secondly, we have adopted a Convention on the
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory
Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean,
which provides a comprehensive regime for the
management of the region’s highly migratory fish
stocks, both in our exclusive economic zone and in the
high seas.
The trans-shipment of nuclear waste through our
waters is of great concern to many island countries
because of the damage it could cause.
My delegation has stated during previous debates
that it agrees fully with the proposal to reform the
Security Council to bring it into tune with the realities
of today’s world order. We are disappointed that, after
10 years of debate, there is still no convergence of
views between the two camps on how to move forward.
To try to address the expansion along with the
question of the veto would be like riding a dead
horse — we would not go anywhere, which is exactly
the situation we are in.
Furthermore, my delegation believes that we have
done all we can do at the representative level, and that
the only way we can make progress is to take it to a
higher level, so that our political leaders can review
what we have done and make a decision on how to
move forward.
On the question of reforms to operational policies
and administrative structures, including budgetary
aspects of the United Nations, my delegation fully
supports the actions taken by the Secretary-General in
this regard, but it appears that much more has to be
done. The areas of review have to be enlarged and
intensified, if indeed the prediction that the regular
budget is going to exceed the $3 billion mark is
correct.
Finally, concerning reform, my delegation fully
supports the view expressed by Australia that the group
system needs modernization. Most of the Pacific small
island countries are buried in the Asian group, which
extends from the Pacific Ocean to the Suez Canal,
while our big brothers, Australia and New Zealand, are
“Others” in the Western European group. Outside the
United Nations system, the Pacific is usually grouped
with East Asia, in both economic and geopolitical
zoning. We see no reason why this cannot be the case
24

at the United Nations, considering that the divide
between Eastern and Western Europe will become
meaningless as the two converge.
Nauru, because of biased and incorrect media
reports over the last five years, now carries a stigma as
a haven for money-laundering through offshore banks
registered in Nauru. There have also been reports that
our Citizen Investment Programme is aiding and
abetting criminals and terrorists, allowing them free
movement by making possible the acquisition of
Nauruan passports.
The reluctance of foreign authorities to provide
proof of allegations of criminal activities by banks
registered in Nauru prevented the Government from
initiating the mechanism provided for in our legislation
to release information on offshore banks to foreign
authorities. This has put us on a collision course.
Nauru was not surprised when, in 2000, the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) listed it along with others as a
non-cooperating country. The following year, Nauru’s
status was further downgraded, and it was put on the
list for “countermeasures” by members of FATF, not
because our laws were insufficient, but because the
goalposts were shifted and our failure involved a lack
of capacity and capability to supervise the offshore
banks registered in Nauru.
In December 2002, the United States
Government, in taking up FATF’s call to apply
countermeasures against Nauru, announced that Nauru
would be designated a “money-laundering” country
under the provisions of the Patriotic Act. The highest
level of sanctions would be applied, which would
prohibit all commercial and financial transactions
between any Nauru-registered financial institution and
the United States. In May 2003 Nauru was accordingly
informed and was given 30 days to show cause as to
why the sanction should not be applied.
Nauru submitted its comments, passed new laws
in March of this year repealing the registration of
offshore banks, and included a sunset clause
terminating the licenses that would come into effect 30
to 180 days — as the case may be — from 27 March
2003, when the law came into force. The Government
has also suspended the Citizen Investment Programme
while it reviews the law, in order to address the
concerns expressed by the United States Department of
State.
A new anti-money-laundering law was passed in
March, and work is in progress on omnibus legislation
that would address the financing of terrorism,
transnational organized crime and money-laundering.
Nauru also signed an article 98 agreement with the
United States.
In the process, Nauru has lost close to $2 million,
if not more, in revenue, which is a drop in the ocean to
OECD members but real money to us, considering that
it is equivalent to 5 per cent of the Government’s
annual budget. We are now waiting to learn our fate —
awaiting the judgement of the United States and the
FATF, as the two are interlinked.
To conclude, Nauru, small as it is, believes that
power consists in a nation’s capacity to link its will
with the purpose of others, to lead by reason and give
the gift of cooperation.









"
4373,58,2003,PLW,"﻿I bring to the
Assembly greetings and good wishes from the
President of the Republic of Palau, Tommy E.
Remengesau, Jr., and from the people and the
Government of the Republic of Palau.
Nearly 60 years ago, in his final inaugural
address, United States President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt reflected on the lessons of the first half of
the twentieth century. He said:
“We have learned that we cannot live alone,
at peace; that our own well-being is dependent on
the well-being of other nations far away. ... We
have learned to be citizens of the world, members
of the human community.”
Those words have more resonance today than ever
before as Palau and the rest of the world enter into the
twenty-first century. The Republic of Palau is enjoying
rapid development, which came with its independence
on 1 October nine years ago. However, at a time of
rapid globalization, when events halfway around the
world — and most recently in our own backyard — can
profoundly affect our safety and prosperity, Palau
realizes that it must join the international community in
this new challenge to protect our people at home and
our way of life.
To that end, the Republic of Palau reaffirms its
unwavering support for the war led by the United
States against terrorism. We all benefit when nations
12

come together to deter aggression and terrorism, to
resolve conflicts, to prevent the spread of diseases and
the spread of dangerous weapons, to promote
democracy and human rights, to open markets and to
create economic and financial stability, to raise living
standards and to protect the environment — to face
those myriad challenges that no nation can meet alone.
Globalization, however, also brings about risks.
Outlaw States and ethnic conflicts threaten regional
stability and progress in many important areas of the
world. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, drug
trafficking and other international crimes are global
concerns that transcend national borders. Other
problems originating overseas — such as the depletion
of resources, rapid population growth, environmental
damage, new infectious diseases such as severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), pervasive corruption
and uncontrolled refugee migration — have
increasingly significant implications for every nation’s
security. National economies will suffer if the global
economy is unstable or if markets collapse, and the
highest environmental standards — such as those set
out in the Kyoto Protocol — will not protect small,
struggling island countries like Palau if other countries
do not join the global effort to bring about peace and
stability.
Protection of the environment is a major concern
to us. Decisions made today regarding the environment
and natural resources can affect every nation’s security
for generations. Environmental threats do not respect
national borders, but they can pose long-term dangers
for every nation’s security and well-being. Scarcity and
depletion of natural resources can trigger and
exacerbate conflict. Environmental threats — such as
climate change, the depletion of stratospheric ozone,
the introduction of nuisance plant and animal species,
the overharvesting of fish and of other living natural
resources, and the transnational movement of
hazardous chemicals and waste — directly threaten the
health and economic well-being of every people of the
world. For Palau, the immediate danger is the rise in
sea level.
Another issue that we wish to address is that of
the cloning of human beings. We believe that any
global and comprehensive ban on human cloning must
include a ban on the cloning of human embryos for
research purposes. While the goal of finding cures to
chronic illnesses is laudable, progress and economic
gain achieved by creating and destroying human life
come at too high a price. We believe that adult-stem-
cell research is a promising field of study that can
provide an ethical source of stem cells for scientific
investigation. The international community must not
allow human life to be devalued in any way, and we
encourage all States to adopt such measures as may be
necessary to prohibit techniques of genetic engineering
that may have adverse consequences on respect for
human dignity.
In public health, we note that many peoples
around the world are suffering and dying each day
from the scourges of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria,
cancer, polio and similar diseases. Combined
international support for public health beyond the
clinic walls must be advocated and put into practice if
we are to eliminate some of those challenges to quality
human life.
Such international support and collaborative
efforts were recently manifested during the spread of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). I also urge
all members of this body to support and ratify the
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted by
the World Health Assembly this year. More
importantly, we should combine our efforts to
implement the mission of the Convention to control
tobacco use, which contributes to diseases and death
throughout the world.
The United Nations is to truly represent all
peoples, with discrimination and exclusion eliminated
from its operational practice. To be effective at
ensuring international peace and security, all nations,
large and small, must be represented in the United
Nations. The Republic of China on Taiwan can no
longer be kept on the sidelines of the most important
international Organization and the leading forum for
international dialogue. Over the past half-century, the
hard-working people of Taiwan have transformed their
country into the world’ s seventeenth largest economy
and a vibrant democracy. In 1996, Taiwan had its first
direct presidential election and, in 2000, accomplished
its first peaceful transfer of executive powers. Since
then Taiwan’s popularly-elected Government has acted
in accordance with United Nations resolutions to
combat international terrorism and to support
humanitarian relief in countries throughout the world,
and yet it is still excluded from the process. Our
experience with SARS has shown us that exclusion can
bring no benefits to anyone. The 23 million Taiwanese
people have an equal right to a voice in the United
13

Nations and should be welcomed by all members of
this body.
The central purpose of the United Nations is the
preservation and advancement of world peace. It
accomplishes its peacemaking and humanitarian
assistance efforts through international cooperation. Its
191 Member States, large and small, rich and poor, and
with different political views, strive collectively to
address global challenges and advance world peace.
Together, they consider and decide on the world’s most
pressing problems. Thus, in this regard I ask the world
here today, at the fifty-eighth session of the General
Assembly, to study and discuss the roots of terrorism
and possible solutions, including inter-religious
intervention; to promote conservation standards to
protect our Earth’s environment; to promote world
public health; to protect the human dignity by banning
the cloning of human embryos; and to continue our
quest for peace and security for all peoples of the
world.













"
4387,58,2003,MHL,"﻿I am honoured to
address the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth
session, on behalf of His Excellency President Kessai
H. Note and the people of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands.
Allow me to extend my sincere congratulations to
you, Mr. President, on your election to your high
office. At the outset, I would like to take this
opportunity to express our deepest condolences to the
bereaved families that lost loved ones in the recent
bombing attack on the United Nations offices in
Baghdad. That tragic event was also a great loss to the
international community. Such horrific acts of
terrorism are utterly condemnable, and those
responsible should be swiftly brought to justice.
My delegation is especially pleased that this
session of the General Assembly will be presided over
by the representative of a fellow member of the
Alliance of Small Island States, and we wish you well,
Sir, in your endeavours throughout the session. We are
hopeful that your presidency will help to highlight the
special needs of small island developing States. It has
long been recognized that such States suffer particular
disadvantages in terms of both environment and
development. This was recently reaffirmed by the
World Summit on Sustainable Development, which
called for a full and comprehensive review of the
Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable
Development of Small Island Developing States.
The coming year will be a particularly important
one for the Marshall Islands and for all small island
developing States as we prepare for the 2004
International Meeting in Mauritius to review the
implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.
In preparation for that Meeting, the Marshall Islands is
currently completing an assessment of the
implementation of the Programme of Action at the
national level. I would like to take this opportunity to
encourage the international donor and development
community to engage with the small island developing
States in the preparatory process and to actively
participate in the International Meeting so that it can
produce successful and practical outcomes for all such
States.
The Marshall Islands is faced with challenges
shared by many small island States. Our land
comprises small, scattered islands and atolls, spread
over vast areas of ocean. Our unique environment is
fragile and highly vulnerable to the threats posed by
global warming and environmental pollution and
degradation. Our natural resource base is extremely
narrow, our economy very small and we are
disadvantaged by our remoteness from world markets.
Given these factors, in our interactions within the
international community, the Marshall Islands is
particularly concerned about the following issues. The
first issue is sustainable development. Pursuing the
three pillars of sustainable development — economic,
social and environmental — poses many challenges for
small island States. During last year’s general debate,
we introduced our national blueprint for sustainable
development. This document forms the basis of our
long-term sustainable development plans, which we are
currently working hard to implement.
In this context, and in the follow-up to the World
Summit on Sustainable Development, we continue to
seek opportunities to form partnerships that will assist
us in the practical implementation of projects under the
Pacific’s 14 Type II Umbrella Initiatives. Areas of
particular importance for our people include the need
for greater access to fresh water, the availability of
affordable, renewable and environmentally sound
energy sources and the development of waste
management systems that minimize hazardous impacts
on society and the environment.
Also in this regard, we welcome the new work
programme of the Commission on Sustainable
Development. We are particularly pleased that small
island developing countries will be considered as a
cross-cutting issue in relation to the themes of each
two-year work cycle, and that the theme of the 2014-
2015 work cycle will focus on small island developing
States issues.
Our second main area of concern is the
environment, and in particular the threats posed by
global climate change and sea level rise. These threats
23

are felt most acutely by low-lying island and atoll
countries such as the Marshall Islands and many of our
Pacific neighbours.
I am pleased to announce that the Marshall
Islands has recently completed its ratification process
for the Kyoto Protocol. I take this opportunity to
commend those States that have ratified the Protocol,
and I urge remaining States to do so without delay.
This matter is surely the most urgent facing the
international community today. If we fail to act now,
the future will see the complete disappearance of many
small island nations.
In relation to environmental matters, the Marshall
Islands is particularly concerned about the state of the
world’s oceans and fisheries. As a nation whose very
livelihood depends on the resources of the sea, the
Marshall Islands Government reaffirms its unwavering
support for the regime established under the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I am also
pleased to state that the Marshall Islands is now a party
to the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.
The Marshall Islands is seriously concerned about
instances of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing
within its exclusive economic zone. Such fishing
gravely undermines the livelihood of our people that
depend on these resources as their primary means of
survival. Regional and international cooperation must
focus on addressing this issue.
Within our region, we are pleased to note the
recent progress of the Convention on the Conservation
and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in
the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. We are also
particularly pleased with the development of the
Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy and we look
forward to broad participation in the upcoming Pacific
Islands Regional Ocean Forum.
An ongoing issue of major concern for the
Marshall Islands is that of nuclear weapons testing.
The people and the environment of the Marshall
Islands continue to suffer as a consequence of the
nuclear weapons tests that were conducted in our
territory between 1946 and 1958.
As we continue to seek resolution of this issue
our people continue to suffer from ongoing health
effects, the food chain still contains dangerously high
radiation levels and our development capacity is
restrained by an inability to use contaminated islands
and atolls.
I have briefly addressed a few issues of major
concern to the Marshall Islands. There are, of course,
many other significant issues to be addressed during
the upcoming session.
One of the most important challenges facing the
international community is the need for a
comprehensive, unified response to combat acts of
international terrorism. I am pleased to be able to say
that the Marshall Islands has ratified all 12 of the core
Conventions against terrorism. We are continually
working to implement the provisions of Security
Council resolution 1373 (2001), and we have taken
many steps at the national level to combat money
laundering and terrorist financing. We reiterate our
solidarity with all Member States that are working to
eliminate terrorism in all its forms.
Another important issue facing this body is the
continued exclusion of the Republic of China on
Taiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall Islands
Government reiterates its concern that the exclusion of
a nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is not
consistent with the inclusive ideal of the United
Nations. I therefore strongly urge every Member State
to reconsider this matter.
The Marshall Islands welcomes the progress
achieved by the International Criminal Court over the
past year. Many positive developments have taken
place, not the least of these being the election of a
prominent panel of judges and the chief prosecutor. We
look forward to the Court becoming fully operational
and we are confident that the Court will prove to be a
valuable mechanism in the administration of justice at
the international level.
Finally, in terms of the need for further United
Nations reform, the Marshall Islands Government
wishes to reiterate its support for the expansion of the
Security Council. We believe that the number of both
permanent and non-permanent members should be
increased, and that such expansion should include
members from both developed and developing
countries. This expansion is urgently needed to
increase the representative base of the Council and to
enhance its legitimacy in the light of the geographic
and political realities of the world today. We also wish
to emphasize the need for further streamlining of the
work of the General Assembly and its six Main
24

Committees in order to enhance the efficiency and
effectiveness of the Organization."
4434,58,2003,VUT,"﻿Allow
me to convey to this Assembly the heartfelt greetings
of the Government and people of the Republic of
Vanuatu. I should like first of all to sincerely
congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
Presidency of the fifty-eight session of the General
Assembly. You have assumed the Presidency at an
extremely difficult, unsettled and complex time. A
series of regrettable events have imperilled the political
and ideological authority which is the universal
foundation of the United Nations ability to work for the
maintenance of peace and security in the world. Given
the enormity of the challenges that now face us, my
delegation — and I personally — would like to
solemnly assure you of our support and full
cooperation.
The job of the Secretary-General is one of the
most difficult jobs, in particular when the very
founding principles of the Organization are being
compromised or simply discarded in favour of the
interest of some Members. The Government of Vanuatu
admires the outstanding authority and clear-sightedness
as well as the diplomatic qualities of Mr. Kofi Annan,
the Secretary-General of the United Nations. His
wisdom and his persistence have enabled Member
States to step up their efforts to make the work of the
United Nations more effective and better adapted to the
maintenance of peace throughout the world, while
keeping the focus on development priorities such as, in
particular, the small economies of island States such as
Vanuatu.
Quite frankly, we are participating in this meeting
somewhat confused about the future of our
Organization, since a minority of Powers are
influencing the system to advance their own interests
and to the detriment of the principles and mandates
which are the prerogatives of the United Nations. The
United Nations mission, inter alia, is to work for
peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations. But
the United Nations is being thwarted because of the
unilateral initiatives of certain Powers. This is the
responsibility of its Members, and this situation has to
be addressed in order to restore the central role of the
United Nations in conflict settlement.
We cannot conceive of any unilateral action in the
future without the risk of paralysing the Organization
itself. The decline of order and justice and the various
conflicts that are occurring throughout the world are
particularly disquieting. If the international system
continues to be influenced by certain Powers, the
future will remain uncertain, notwithstanding the
individual efforts made by Member States and despite
the countless resolutions adopted by this Assembly.
In recent years, the international geopolitical
environment has been dramatically shaken.
Irresponsible actions have unleashed much hatred and
4

bitterness, which jeopardizes world peace and
harmony. The fundamental principles that justified the
existence of the United Nations are now being called
into question and we are duty-bound explicitly and
clearly to redefine the new objectives and to strengthen
the founding principles of the United Nations.
Many tragic events have occurred and countless
innocent lives have been destroyed. These are the facts
of the world today. I would like to take this opportunity
to pay tribute to the members of the Secretariat who
tragically lost their lives in the line of duty and to
convey condolences to the United Nations Secretariat
as well as to the families of the victims of that brutal
and horrendous act. That barbaric and inhuman act of
violence saddens us all. I join with previous speakers
in condemning that brutal act.
Unfortunately, some of us have contributed to the
current situation. A brief overview of past events
definitely shows that various world conflicts, wars,
famines, droughts, epidemics, poverty and
environmental degradation are on the increase. Many
developing countries are facing a variety of
development difficulties, such as the increase in
unemployment that contributes to the degradation of
societies. In many cases, the destruction of social and
cultural progress, caused by globalization and
modernization, has increased feelings of hatred and
bitterness. The main outlines for future development
have been mapped out but the success of the
implementation of this remains dependant on political
will, particularly the financial commitments of the
industrialized countries. However, I am still optimistic
and I trust in your wisdom, Mr. President, to guide us
to a better future.
While counter-terrorism and normalization in
some countries are on the agenda, we should not divert
our attention from the development issues that can
undermine the future of developing countries.
Considerable resources will be devoted to security
questions, when only a tiny share of this amount would
be enough to meet the needs of the developing
countries.
The environment is another area of concern. We
support previous statements by representatives of the
island States of the Pacific, and we continue to
encourage countries that have not yet done so to ratify
the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.
How can we explain to our peoples that certain
international obligations are priorities only for the
small States, whereas the super-Powers seem hardly to
be concerned about them, or are even hostile to them,
and yet do not hesitate to impose a series of conditions
which contribute to the underdevelopment of small
States and which we could describe as political and
economic interference?
The unilateral imposition and maintenance of the
ban on the sale of products containing kava in Europe
is an example of this discriminatory attitude. The
European countries involved do not seem to take
account of the scientific studies establishing the
absence of any link between kava and kidney disease, a
link suggested by the health authorities of some
European countries.
The threat of economic sanctions by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) against tax havens in the
Pacific, while excepting European jurisdictions, leaves
no alternative than to accept the conditions imposed
without any consideration of the economies concerned.
Since our acceptance in principle of the OECD
conditions we have received no indication from that
organization of any quid pro quo that it can provide in
the case of economic loss.
Despite the opposition of the Pacific region to the
transportation of nuclear waste in the waters of our
region, certain Powers show a complete lack of respect
for the sovereignty of the small islands States of the
Pacific. It is not only a question of the environment and
of protecting our natural resources against any disaster;
it is much more a question of ethics. In other words, we
regret the complete lack of respect for the small island
States of the Pacific as fully fledged members of the
international community.
It is generally recognized today that trade is the
engine of development. However, like other countries
of similar size, Vanuatu is facing certain tariff and non-
tariff restrictions which are causing our agricultural
products to be inaccessible to, in particular, markets
that are often described as free.
Bringing national laws into line with international
conventions carries costs that are often
disproportionate for the small countries. In almost all
cases, national resource constraints, financial as well as
technical, are ignored, whereas they must be taken into
5

account for the success of any programme of action
resulting from international commitments.
We must not lose sight of the basic principle of
the right to self-determination. We reiterate that the
credibility of the United Nations rests on following up
the implementation of any reform aimed at recognizing
the right of peoples to self-determination, in the
context of respect for others and for the United Nations
Charter. We therefore applaud the efforts by the
Government of Indonesia to open and maintain
dialogue with the various social and minority
constituents, as well as those in West Papua, in respect
for human rights and freedom of expression.
We welcome the positive role and efforts of
Australia and New Zealand, after an unprecedented
decision by the countries of the region, to restore and
maintain order, security and peace in the region, and in
particular in the Solomon Islands.
We applaud the French President, Mr. Jacques
Chirac, for having initiated a summit meeting of heads
of State and Government of the South Pacific region,
held last July, in order to strengthen our cooperation.
I trust in your wisdom, Mr. President, to make
sure that all the theories expounded in the Assembly
are followed by concrete, practical action. We have a
duty to work collectively through the multilateral
institutions to help resolve and overcome the
difficulties and challenges that face us. In order to do
that, we need to constantly review the very structure of
the United Nations. The various unilateral initiatives
have highlighted the limits of the current structure
which have caused a weakening of the multilateral
approach. Many super-Powers are unwilling to share
even a part of their authority within the United Nations
and seem to prefer the status quo. The principles of
democratization and transparency advocated by most
Members must be taken into account in the
reorganization and in the Organization’s decision-
making process.
My delegation supports changing the permanent
membership of the Security Council to include Japan
and a representative of the African continent, of the
Middle East and of the Alliance of Small Island States.
This reform would give the Organization greater
transparency, restore confidence in it and improve
international cooperation. My delegation strongly
supports the proposals made, and in particular the
nomination of a group of leaders representing the
various regions and the main categories of economies
in order to launch this important proposal. This long
awaited review will finally come about.
We need to take this great opportunity to renew
and strengthen the United Nations in order to give it
the qualities it needs to meet the challenges of our
time. Strengthening the cohesion and unity of our great
community of nations will be a daunting challenge, one
which we are prepared to meet, while offering our
complete and unconditional support.
We have aired our concerns in order to stress the
injustices and contradictions in the current situation,
but we assure the Organization of our support and our
commitment to seeing the Organization revitalized,
capable of meeting the aspirations of all its Members,
whether large or small, rich or poor, strong or weak.
The contradictions of principle, mounting
terrorism, human suffering, and the emergence of
conflicts in regions that are normally peaceful,
combined with the injustices of globalization, are all
ingredients for a future catastrophe.
In conclusion, my delegation remains convinced
that only a reinvigorated United Nations can contribute
in a lasting manner to world peace and security.



"
4445,58,2003,AUS,"﻿To stand again at this
podium today, representing Australia as its Foreign
Minister, entering into the great conversation of
nations, is an unsettling experience. Seldom has this
31

forum been confronted with so many dimensions of
uncertainty, so many challenges to global peace,
security and orderly economic reform. Seldom has its
own capacity for regeneration to deal with them been
so insistently put to the test.
Conor Cruise O’Brien, one of Ireland’s finest
writers, an official and later ambassador here, famously
remarked:
“The cynicism necessary in the approach to
the United Nations must at some point be made to
yield to reverence: the reverence which is
appropriate to ... an institution which is
humanity’s prayer to itself to be saved from
itself.”
Recently one of Australia’s foremost novelists,
Frank Moorhouse, wrote a meditative essay on this
theme. In it he discerned a new pair of parallel world
orders:
“For the first time in our lives, there are two
very powerful agents in world affairs … the
United Nations Security Council … and the
United States.”
He noted that “for all the cynicism about the
futility of international intervention, pragmatically,
people are being helped daily by the United Nations”
and that “visionary and innovative international
missions” continue to be conceived and achieved
within it.
Moorhouse’s estimation of the significance of the
United Nations is debatable. But a combination of
pragmatism, vision and reforming innovation is
necessary if, as I have already warned, this
Organization is to avoid frittering away its credibility
and influence by failing to exercise its power
effectively.
In the words of Secretary-General Annan, we
should not shy away from the need to improve and,
where necessary, change the structure and function of
the United Nations and other international institutions
to make sure they remain effective in promoting
security and peace.
I alluded to the global challenges which confront
us. First among them is the emergence of the “age of
terror”. Where once it was possible to view terrorism
as the lamentable legacy of a few unsafe regions, today
almost no country has been left untouched. Despite the
war on terror — a war we are winning — terrorism
continues to be a scourge to which neither age,
nationality, religion or political affiliation provides
immunity. It takes a considerable act of imaginative
engagement to see these new forms of nihilism for
what they really are. They are a negation of civilization
and of the discourse that sustains it.
I referred earlier to the visionary and innovative
work which sometimes only the United Nations can do.
In that context, I want to pause to pay tribute to the
Secretary-General’s senior representative in Baghdad,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, well known to many of you
here. That such a man, engaged in such vital tasks —
along with so many of his colleagues — should have
been swept by a terrorist bomb into the silent
democracy of death epitomizes the struggle between
civilization and the unthinkable alternative.
We cannot allow terrorists to succeed in
determining the course of world events. We must
overwhelm their efforts to disrupt global security and
prosperity, to undermine democratic countries or
destabilize nation-building.
Terrorism has also created a new urgency in
solving a more familiar problem — the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction. Efforts by rogue States to
develop and traffic in weapons of mass destruction
materials underpin the priority we give to non-
proliferation. The possibility that weapons of mass
destruction might fall into the hands of terrorists makes
it an absolute imperative. Terrorism and proliferation
do not occur in a vacuum — except, of course, a moral
vacuum. It is no longer open to us to ignore the failed
States which have become their incubators or the
transnational crime on which they depend. The
promotion of good governance and democratization are
imperatives both morally and pragmatically. They have
become preconditions for international security.
Good governance serves both global and national
interests, as improved governance will fortify the
United Nations itself. Without it, developing States will
never be able fully to realize the opportunities that
globalization presents: chiefly, the potential to erase
divisions between themselves and the developed world.
That can occur only if we are all prepared to accept the
disciplines that global trade liberalization imposes.
While the prospects, post-Cancún, do not seem
particularly favourable, pursuing the Doha objectives
32

remains the best way to alleviate poverty and its
attendant ills in the developing world.
In confronting these challenges — such as
security, governance, poverty, terrorism and
pandemics — collective action is likely to yield the
best results, since not even the most powerful among
us can bear the burden alone. Effective regional action
also remains important. Australia has built, with its
neighbours, a network of bilateral counter-terrorism
arrangements. These enhance practical, operational-
level liaison among regional security, intelligence and
law enforcement agencies that have seen terror attacks
prevented, networks disrupted and terrorists arrested.
Similarly, we are developing regional approaches
to confront the dangers of State failure. Together with
our Pacific Island Forum partners, we are restoring
hope for a better future to the people of Solomon
Islands. This Regional Assistance Mission has already
made excellent progress in its efforts to restore law and
order and to rebuild the institutions of governance.
Requested by the Government of Solomon Islands and
supported and implemented by Pacific island nations,
the Mission is consistent with the United Nations
Charter’s original vision of strong regional efforts to
maintain international peace and security. Indeed, we
will continue to concentrate on improved standards of
governance, which are central to our assistance in our
own region. The Pacific Island Forum leaders recently
endorsed efforts to promote more effective regional
institutions and, where appropriate, the pooling of
resources to ensure that services are both deliverable
and sustainable.
The virtues of collective action are self-evident.
But collectivity ought not serve as a mantra which is an
obstacle to effective action. Sometimes the most
effective means of preserving security — and indeed
international law — occur alongside the traditional
mechanisms of multilateral diplomacy. Australia is a
strong supporter of multilateral institutions and
processes, but only insofar as they are a means to an
effective end.
The major global disarmament and non-
proliferation treaties remain critical to setting norms of
international order. But ultimately, those instruments
must be enforced. States are not merely entitled, but
obliged, to take action to uphold those norms,
especially when the transfer of weapons of mass
destruction outside internationally agreed frameworks
is involved. The conviction that States must uphold
international norms — particularly in relation to
weapons of mass destruction — led Australia to join
the coalition to disarm Iraq, and, in the same way, we
recently joined with others in what is known as the
Proliferation Security Initiative.
Australia believes the United Nations has a
critical role in promoting international peace and
security. First-hand experience in East Timor reminds
us of that fact, and we look to the United Nations for
continuing contributions to ensuring its stability.
Australia also appreciates the work of the United
Nations in rebuilding civil society in Iraq. Of the $100
million Australia has committed to humanitarian and
reconstruction assistance in Iraq, much has been
directed through United Nations agencies. Those are
two examples in which the United Nations is playing a
positive role.
Nevertheless, the role of the United Nations in
international affairs is under critical scrutiny, and with
good reason. The United Nations, through its Member
States, needs to do much more to adapt to the evolving
global environment. Australia has long been an
advocate of a more focused, efficient United Nations
system. The Secretary-General’s reforms to date — in
particular the Brahimi peacekeeping changes — have
been a valuable start.
Radical and fundamental change is now needed.
The Secretary-General rightly states that the General
Assembly is bogged down with an unwieldy agenda
and repetitive and sterile debates. We need to ask
ourselves, if much of the activity of the General
Assembly — or indeed of the Economic and Social
Council — did not occur, what practical difference
would it make, and would anyone notice?
Again, as Australia has long argued, the
composition of the Security Council is out of step with
geopolitical realities. The permanent membership of
the Security Council should be expanded to reflect the
current realities — with the addition of countries such
as Japan, India, Brazil, Indonesia and an African
nation.
We support an overhaul of the United Nations
architecture, particularly in the light of new security
threats. The functioning of all the major United
Nations organs needs to be re-examined, as does the
inter-relationship among them. Old shibboleths — such
as the excessive homage to sovereignty, even at the
33

expense of the preservation of humanity and human
values — should not constrain us. We must end absurd
duplication of effort. We should refocus the United
Nations on areas where it can and should make a very
real difference. But we must be imaginative and bold.
The group system, for example, needs
modernization. Australia could become part of an East
Asia and Pacific grouping, and the old divide of
Eastern and Western Europe should be dispensed with
to reflect the new, converging European reality. That
would form the basis for greater regional cooperation
within the United Nations system, for greater
engagement and problem-solving on a regional scale.
In short, we must work urgently on a bold
blueprint for revitalization, which we should consider
by the summer of next year. That is why we welcome
the Secretary-General’s proposal for a high-level
review panel. Real commitment to change — which
can be endorsed at a second San Francisco
Conference — will be necessary if the United Nations
is to rediscover its credibility and its promise."
4471,58,2003,NZL,"﻿The General Assembly
is meeting in the shadow of the tragedy last month in
which United Nations staff were killed or injured in
Baghdad. New Zealand unreservedly condemns such
brutal and calculated acts of terror. The United Nations,
after all, was in Iraq to improve the conditions of Iraqi
people and to assist the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.
We mourn the loss of all those who perished. In
particular, I pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello, who
worked so effectively in the world’s trouble spots,
including Timor-Leste, where New Zealand worked
alongside him and developed huge admiration for his
ability and determination.
This was not the first occasion on which the
employees of the international community have been
targeted, although it was the worst. History suggests
that it will not be the last.
To do its work effectively, the United Nations
must interact with local communities, not operate from
behind barbed wire and concrete barriers. Its
employees are mainly unarmed civilians. We, the States
Members of the United Nations, must do more to
protect those whom we employ to work on our behalf.
Nine years ago New Zealand was at the forefront
in creating the Convention for the Safety of United
7

Nations and Associated Personnel. It was opened for
signature in 1995. Regrettably, only one third of the
membership has since become a party to it. We urge all
countries to do so now.
New Zealand believes that the Convention should
be widened to cover all situations where United
Nations and other associated personnel are engaged in
peacekeeping, humanitarian and other assistance-
related activities.
Over the last year we have witnessed terrorist
attacks, including in Casablanca, Riyadh and Jakarta,
as well as in Baghdad.
Next month is the first anniversary of the terrorist
attack in Bali, in which more than 200 people lost their
lives. And two years ago this city itself was the victim
of the 9/11 attacks, which took 3,000 lives.
International terrorism remains the primary threat to
the security and well-being of people across the world.
If we are to defeat terrorism, regional cooperation
is imperative. In the Asia Pacific region, a concerted
response to terrorism is now at the centre of the
Association of South-east Asian Nations Regional
Forum agenda and is becoming increasingly important
in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
The Pacific Islands Forum is responding
collectively to security challenges, including terrorism,
transnational crimes and challenges to national
integrity and independence.
An effective campaign against terrorism requires
international collaboration on intelligence, military,
social and economic measures.
New Zealand is aware that while we focus on the
symptoms of terrorism, the international community
must work together to tackle the conditions that foster
it. We welcome the Norwegian initiative to strengthen
analysis of the causes of terrorism. There are simply no
ends that can justify the death and the maiming of
vulnerable and innocent people.
New Zealand has, since 1972, supported the
development of a comprehensive international regime to
outlaw terrorism. I hope that the General Assembly will
be able to move forward on this issue and conclude the
comprehensive and nuclear terrorism conventions.
In combating terrorism, however, we should
avoid undermining the very values we are seeking to
uphold. The fight against terrorism should not become
an excuse to justify actions that do not conform to
international standards of humanity.
New Zealand is the current Chair of the Pacific
Islands Forum, which it hosted last month. Leaders
strongly endorsed the Regional Assistance Mission to
the Solomon Islands — a concrete example of the
region working together to assist one of its members to
restore security, stability and progress to its people.
New Zealand joined with the other members of
the Pacific Islands Forum in responding to a request
from the Solomon Islands Government for police and
military assistance to end the actions of armed
criminals responsible for the deterioration in the social
and economic conditions in the Solomon Islands. A
police-led operation has been working successfully to
restore the rule of law and economic stability.
In failed or weak States, Governments often lack the
capacity or will to exercise territorial control. That can
create a power vacuum for terrorist organizations and
criminals to exploit and maintain safe havens, training
facilities and bases for launching terrorist operations.
The Regional Assistance Mission has gone
exceptionally well to date and has received strong
support from the people of the Solomon Islands. It is a
Pacific solution to a Pacific problem. Cooperation and
commitment by Pacific States to respond to regional
security needs, under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands
Forum, is a model that other regions could adopt.
The statements of support from the Secretary-
General and the Security Council for this regional
action, taken in accordance with the Charter, are
welcome. We would urge the United Nations to assist
where it can the process of rebuilding the social
structure and the economy of that country.
New Zealand is working to enhance and
complement existing security capabilities within the
Pacific region. We are engaged in a number of
activities, including establishing border security
systems and drafting model legislation to address
terrorism and transnational organized crime.
The international community must retain an
ongoing commitment to Afghanistan, where President
Karzai’s Government continues to face significant
challenges. Improving security outside Kabul will be a
crucial element in bringing political stability to
Afghanistan.
8

It is in the interests of us all to assist in the
restoration of Afghanistan — not only for the well-
being of the Afghan people, but also so that terrorists
cannot operate freely within its borders.
Earlier this week, New Zealand assumed
leadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in
Bamian Province. I am pleased that we could
demonstrate support for the Afghanistan Transitional
Government in this way.
The shared nightmare of all States is that
weapons of mass destruction or the materials from
which they can be constructed will find their way into
the terrorist arsenal. The possibility of nuclear weapons
in the hands of terrorists is a worst-case scenario with
horrific implications. We must do everything we can to
prevent this from happening.
The possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by
terrorist groups increases as the numbers and types of
these weapons, and the States that possess them,
continue to expand. For these and other reasons the
elimination of these weapons is vital.
New Zealand calls on all countries to commit and
to adhere to multilateral disarmament and arms control
treaties.
North Korea’s proclaimed nuclear weapons
programme is a major concern. We urge North Korea to
resume its cooperation with the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and its commitment to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The current
multilateral dialogue process is a positive way forward.
We commend China for facilitating this.
Iran, too, must heed the strong message of the
international community and take the urgent steps
required to restore confidence that its nuclear
intentions are peaceful.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is equally
about nuclear disarmament. The commitment given by
the nuclear-weapon States to give up their nuclear
weapons, reaffirmed unequivocally at the NPT Review
Conference in 2000, must be honoured.
The nuclear Powers have a particular responsibility
in this respect. They must lead by example against
proliferation. Meaningful steps toward permanent
disarmament would add to their moral authority in
demanding that others must not develop nuclear
weapons capability.
The invasion of Iraq has had a profound impact
on this Organization. We regret that differences of view
could not be resolved in the Security Council.
The reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of its
sovereignty and the rebuilding of political and social
structures to guarantee the Iraqi people a better life are
now the critical issues. We welcome initiatives to push
forward the political and constitutional process.
The passage of Security Council resolutions 1483
(2003) and 1500 (2003) recognizes the vital role of the
United Nations and the need for the international
community to be fully engaged in reconstruction
efforts. While responsibility for security must
inevitably rest with coalition forces, multilateralism
offers the best prospect and the greatest legitimacy for
the process of transition back to Iraqi self-rule.
New Zealand has announced substantial
contributions to reconstruction and humanitarian relief
work. These include the deployment of a New Zealand
Defence Force light engineer group to work on
humanitarian and reconstruction tasks alongside a
United Kingdom engineer regiment in southern Iraq.
We have helped with demining operations and have
made contributions through United Nations agencies,
the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-
governmental organizations.
New Zealand continues to view the United
Nations as the best hope we have to collectively pursue
the principles enshrined in the Charter. The strength of
the United Nation is that it brings all countries of the
world together on an equal footing to address common
problems. Millions of people around the world have had
their lives improved by the actions of the United Nations.
East Timor is but one recent example of its effectiveness
when it is supported by a common will to act.
At the same time, we all recognize the need to
reform the Organization. In opening this session, the
Secretary-General called on us to consider whether the
rules and instruments of this multilateral institution
continue to serve us well. We have been discussing the
reform of the Security Council for more than a decade
now. It is time to make an institution designed in an
earlier age, for a smaller number of nations more
representative and responsive to the 191 current
Members of the United Nations. We welcome the
establishment of a panel to address key issues
fundamental to the Organization’s future role. Member
States will need to put aside self-interest and
9

differences to reach agreement on the panel’s findings
and to translate those into action.
Fifty-eight years ago, the United Nations was
created in the aftermath of the death and devastation
that had resulted from two world wars. The vision of
its founders was that of an organization that would
establish rules to govern international behaviour, with
procedures to enforce them through collective action. The
United Nations was bestowed with a unique legitimacy
and unique authority to resolve conflict. Whatever its
shortcomings, it remains an indispensable organization.
The challenge before us is to create the structures
and provide the political will that will enable it to
deliver the peaceful, just and prosperous world that is
the hope and expectation of humanity.





"
4480,58,2003,KIR,"﻿Allow me at the outset to
offer Mr. Julian Hunte my warm congratulations on his
election as President. We are confident that he will
guide our deliberations during this fifty-eighth session
to a productive conclusion. Let me also express my
deep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan,
for his effective guidance of the work of the Assembly
at its fifty-seventh session.
Four years ago Kiribati joined the United Nations
as one of its youngest Member States. Our membership
of the United Nations was an affirmation of our faith in
and support for the noble principles enshrined in the
United Nations Charter.
Since then, events have occurred to test the
resolve of this Organization. Indeed, the United
Nations has faced many challenges. The recent brutal
and calculated attack on United Nations personnel in
Baghdad, which resulted in a tragic loss of life and
many injuries, are to be condemned. We mourn the loss
of the Secretary-General’s senior representative, Sergio
Vieira de Mello, and the others who perished in the
attacks.
Kiribati commends the Secretary-General for his
unwavering determination to ensure that the United
Nations continues to perform the role we expect of it in
the international arena.
We have followed with increasing alarm the
globalization of terror. No longer can we in the Pacific
claim immunity from terrorism. The consequences of
terrorist acts are abhorrent. Kiribati condemns
terrorism and all acts of terror directed against innocent
people. We cannot condone acts of terror, regardless of
their purported objective.
Even though we have not been, and may never be,
directly subjected to horrors such as that of 11
September 2001 and the terrorist acts in Riyadh,
Jakarta and Baghdad, we realize that terrorism knows
no boundaries or limitations. It is a crime against
humanity and against the international community as a
whole, and we must therefore work collectively to
defeat it. To do so will require an international
response backed by concerted regional and national
efforts.
At the international level, Kiribati fully supports
the relevant Security Council resolutions against
terrorism. The Pacific Islands Forum is actively
addressing security issues at the regional level. Despite
financial constraints, Kiribati is pleased to have
contributed, within the framework of the 2000
Biketawa Declaration, police personnel to the Regional
Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. My
Government decided to contribute to that initiative
because of our firm belief in the strength of regional
cooperation. The Regional Assistance Mission to the
Solomon Islands is a clear demonstration of the ability
of Pacific Island Forum member countries to respond
swiftly and cooperatively to requests from fellow
member countries for support in restoring law and
order.
While Kiribati appreciates the recognition of this
regional initiative by the United Nations, we hope and
urge that further assistance will be forthcoming to
strengthen and ensure the success of this undertaking.
At the national level, Kiribati has introduced
various bills and taken other measures as part of its
effort to address security challenges. This is an
ongoing process that will progress at a pace dictated by
our financial situation, personnel and other constraints.
We are confident that, given our commitment, and with
appropriate assistance from the international
community, we will in time achieve our goals.
Kiribati supports the idea that terrorism must be
eliminated. We must all fight against those who reject
dialogue as a means of securing their objectives and
instead resort to terror. We would like to associate
ourselves with the many speakers who advocate that
18

we exercise restraint. We must ensure that in our fight
against terrorism we continue to uphold the principles
that are the cornerstones of this esteemed body — the
principles that we cherish and in which we firmly
believe.
Kiribati fully supports efforts to address the
security challenges facing the world today. We are,
however, mindful that the magnitude of the security
challenges facing Member States differs.
In the case of Kiribati there are many challenges
and problems that threaten our people and country.
Kiribati is one of the least developed countries and is
also a small island developing State located in the
middle of the Pacific ocean. Our remoteness and
insularity, narrow economic base, small population and
high population growth rate are factors that we have to
accept.
Being a small island developing States poses
many challenges to national efforts in terms of
sustainable development and beneficial integration into
the world economy. These unique characteristics
warrant special consideration for sustained and
enhanced cooperation from development partners.
Kiribati has benefited, and continues to benefit,
from the various programmes offered through the many
United Nations agencies. In acknowledging with
gratitude the support extended by the United Nations in
this regard, I would also like to record our appreciation
to our development partners for their continuing
support for our efforts at increasing and enhancing the
equitable distribution of development benefits to our
peoples.
We realize that a lot more needs to be done.
Kiribati has a vast exclusive economic zone rich in
fisheries and marine resources. We are actively
promoting the sustainable exploitation of these
resources, and consider the establishment of an onshore
fish processing facility to be an appropriate
development.
Kiribati comprises low-lying coral atolls and is
therefore very vulnerable to climate change, climate
variability and sea-level rise. This is an issue of high
priority for us, as it is for other low-lying countries. It
is also an issue that requires an international response.
Political commitment and a high level of cooperation
by the international community are called for in
addressing this challenge.
There is a need for immediate reductions in and
limits on greenhouse gas emissions to bring them into
line with the objective of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. We call
upon the major emitters of greenhouse gases to ratify
the Kyoto Protocol in a timely manner.
We recognize the need to develop and implement
appropriate adaptation response measures, and call for
support in this respect from international sources,
including the Global Environment Facility.
International support will similarly be required in
the joint implementation of the vulnerability and
adaptation Pacific type 2 initiatives, launched last year
at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
We look forward to the 2004 international
meeting to be held in Mauritius. This will provide a
valuable opportunity to the international community to
take stock of what has happened since Rio and
Barbados. We certainly hope that Mauritius will
provide a road map of concrete and practical actions,
which are required to achieve the objectives of the
Programme of Action. While we accept primary
responsibility for our own development, we also realize
that the achievement of such aspirations will be beyond
our reach if we have to work alone. We require the
assistance of our partners in development.
These have been turbulent times for the United
Nations. Recent events have brought to the fore the
need for the United Nations to adapt. The rapidly
changing global environment in which the United
Nations operates demands adaptations if the
Organization is to continue to be of relevance to
Member States.
Kiribati joins previous speakers in welcoming the
reform initiatives outlined by the Secretary-General.
We realize that Member States must direct and actively
support the adaptation process. The direction and
support thus accorded to the United Nations will enable
it to become more responsive to the aspirations of its
Member States and those of the communities and
peoples they represent.
Kiribati fully supports the view that the United
Nations and its major organs should be more
representative and more democratic in order to reflect
the expanded membership of the Organization. The
rules so appropriate to situations in the 1940s cannot be
19

applied practically and effectively in the twenty-first
century.
To conclude, we are faced with new challenges.
We must commit ourselves to tackling these emerging
challenges meaningfully. We must therefore be ready to
introduce and accept changes appropriate to our times.




"
4505,59,2004,PNG,"My
delegation warmly welcomes you to the presidency of
the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and
pledges our support. We acknowledge that you are also
from our Forum of Small States group and therefore
share our common problems and challenges. Please
convey my delegation’s commendation to your
predecessor, the Honourable Julian Hunte, Minister for
Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, for his strong
leadership of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth
session.
Let me also take this opportunity to thank the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and his staff for
the good work they continue to do for our global
community.
We currently live in a changing world, one which
past generations would even be amazed at. One of the
greatest achievements of the United Nations system is
the process of decolonization which has seen more than
70 countries, including my own, take their rightful
place in this Assembly. The process will not be
complete, however, until the remaining 16 Non-Self-
Governing Territories, including New Caledonia and
Tokelau, have exercised their inalienable right to self-
determination.
The world continues to witness great leaps in
technology, but at the same time we have also seen an
increase in some global dilemmas — poverty and
hunger, the ravages of HIV/AIDS, wars, conflicts and
terrorism, among others.
Each of our countries face numerous challenges
in this changing world and many of them are common
to all of us, regardless of our size, location and status
as developed or developing countries. Under the
circumstances, and more than ever before, we need to
work together as a community of nations to help each
other address those challenges. Nowhere is that more
evident than in the domain of international peace and
security. A terrorist act committed in one State today
also affects others elsewhere in the global community.
We condemn the recent tragedy in Beslan, Russia,
the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and
the ongoing terrorist acts in the Middle East, Iraq, and
other parts of the world. We also condemn the recent
22

tragedy in Darfur, the Sudan, and commend Canada
and Japan for their generous assistance.
In circumstances like the foregoing, those most
affected are innocent civilians, especially women and
children. We therefore support the Secretary-General’s
efforts to rally the international community to
subscribe to the treaties on the protection of civilians.
In many cases, terrorists also take the lives of
United Nations and other humanitarian workers who
are doing unselfish and dedicated work under difficult
circumstances to serve our common humanity. In that
regard, we urge all Member States to support the
Convention on the Safety of United Nations and
Associated Personnel.
The situation in the Middle East remains
intractable, requiring constant and deliberate attention
by the United Nations, especially by the Security
Council. Our own experience in the Bougainville
conflict has taught us that there can be peace if all
parties really desire it and are willing to resolve their
differences. We therefore urge all parties to the conflict
in the Middle East — including Israel and Palestine, as
well as the major players, particularly the Quartet — to
formulate a peace plan that is mutually acceptable to
all.
Papua New Guinea concurs with Secretary-
General Kofi Annan’s recent statement to the
Assembly at its 3rd meeting, which highlighted how
important it is for the rule of law to prevail if we are to
achieve peace and security in the world.
Like many other Member States, Papua New
Guinea has acceded to the various counter-terrorism
treaties, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373
(2001). We believe that the reporting obligations under
the provisions of those treaties should be streamlined
to include regional reports, which would solve many
capacity issues for small nations with limited
resources. Because many of our regional legal, military
and law enforcement agencies meet regularly, those
meetings could provide the opportunity to compile
regional reports on our fight against international
terrorism. We believe that there is every desire to fulfil
treaty obligations; but if some of the more onerous
tasks can be lightened for the small countries through
regional reports, bodies like the Counter-Terrorism
Committee, the Security Council, the General
Assembly and other related agencies could be better
served.
The small States are doing their best to fulfil their
obligations. Like many other Members States, we take
seriously our responsibilities and obligations to fight
the scourge of international terrorism and related issues
including the trafficking of people.
The Pacific region advocates that the United
Nations continue to closely and seriously study the
notion of collective security along with collective
action, ideas upon which many of our actions to bring
stability to our region continue to be based.
We are custodians of the biggest ocean and its
resources. Papua New Guinea, in particular, is
endowed with 5 to 7 per cent of the world’s
biodiversity. We therefore share a common
responsibility to ensure the protection and conservation
of those resources which are of vital importance to
humanity.
We encourage sustainable logging practices in
order to avoid the denuding of our vast rainforest
resources. We condemn destructive fishing methods
and urge all Member States to adhere to sustainable
management and conservation regimes in order to meet
future demands.
At the Pacific Islands Forum, our leaders recently
adopted a new vision for the Pacific region in the form
of the Pacific Plan, which embraces four key areas:
economic growth, sustainable development, security
and good governance.
The Pacific Islands Forum will be engaging with
the European Union and other development partners to
advance the interests of the region, especially those of
economic growth and sustainable development.
I share the view enunciated by other speakers that
there can be no security without development, and that
equally, there can be no development without peace
and security. As important links, both need to be
addressed simultaneously if we want peace and
sustainable development to prevail.
We are pleased to see regional solidarity and
assistance in conflict situations bear good results in
Bougainville and in our neighbour, the Solomon
Islands. We also note that other regional actions taken
by our leaders, such as the establishment of the Pacific
Transnational Crime Coordination Centre in Fiji,
enhance law enforcement and intelligence sharing in
the region.
Concerning good governance, our leaders
encouraged Pacific Member Governments to sign and
23

ratify the United Nations Convention against
Corruption in accordance with the spirit of the
Biketawa Declaration.
Over the past several years, Papua New Guinea
has been the beneficiary of regional and international
assistance in the rebuilding and return to normalcy of
the island of Bougainville, after a decade-long conflict.
We thank the members of the Security Council, both
past and present, for their goodwill, patience and
understanding in what has been an extremely painful
experience for us. We have appreciated the support and
counsel of each member of the Council throughout that
important process. The conflict has greatly affected our
nation and we have learned many lessons. We are re-
establishing the rule of law in a profound and thorough
constitutional process which will result in a
democratically elected autonomous government for the
people of Bougainville. While we are close to
achieving that, we are equally mindful that each step
taken now to finalize and consolidate the Bougainville
constitution is critically important for the autonomous
government of Bougainville to be sustained
successfully.
We continue to receive valuable support and
assistance for the peace process from the Secretary-
General as well as from our Pacific neighbours:
Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and the
Solomon Islands. Rebuilding and restoration of
services in Bougainville has been greatly assisted by
our development partners, including the United
Nations Development Programme, the United Nations
Children’s Fund, the European Union, Australia, New
Zealand and Japan, among others. We thank them all
and look forward to their continued support and
cooperation.
We continue to be concerned about the security
and vulnerability of many of our small island States.
As noted and endorsed by Pacific leaders at the recent
Pacific Islands Forum Summit in Samoa, the
forthcoming International Meeting on the 10-year
review of the Barbados Programme of Action, to be
held in Mauritius in 2005, will provide an opportunity
to discuss with our development partners the many
issues which confront small island States, including
those in our subregion.
Development of women and children through
sports must have a special place in our quest to
improve the socio-economic well-being of our people.
We are also working hard to implement the Millennium
Development Goals and the outcomes of the World
Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).
The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to have
devastating consequences in many developing
countries. Our leaders in the Pacific region have
endorsed a regional strategy for HIV/AIDS noting the
need to address the issue urgently.
Small arms and light weapons will always
threaten the stability of many small States. Therefore,
we look forward to the continuing work towards a
United-Nations-supported action plan for dealing with
small arms.
Climate change is a threat to all humankind and
therefore deserves the attention of the international
community, which must work together to address it.
We are appreciative of the position of the United
Kingdom as underlined by Prime Minister, The Right
Honourable Tony Blair, in a recent statement
highlighting the threat of sea level rise and related
issues. I am aware that there are scientific studies
being carried out, but the real issue is that the effects of
climate change and global warming are being felt daily
by many island States. We in Papua New Guinea are no
more immune to climate change and sea level rise than
are many other small island States. The island
communities in Papua New Guinea, like those of our
neighbouring countries in the Pacific, are being
affected adversely by sea level rise. We empathize with
our colleagues from many other island States which
continually suffer from the effects of the problem. Our
plight is further compounded by natural disasters,
including the ravages of hurricanes, cyclones,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods and tsunamis.
In that context, our sympathies go to the peoples
and the Governments of the Caribbean region,
especially those of Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, the
Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, among others,
as well as to the inhabitants of cities and towns of the
southern states of the United States of America, which
have been devastated by the recent hurricanes.
As a global community we must pool our
resources and consider ways of mitigating the adverse
effects of climate change in order to help those States
which are vulnerable. We applaud the intention of the
Russian Federation to consider becoming a party to the
Kyoto Protocol and urge others to recognize their
responsibility to the global community by doing the
same.
24

We look forward to the final report of the High-
level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change
appointed by the Secretary-General, which will form
the basis for high-level discussions on United Nations
reforms, including the expansion and composition of
the Security Council. We believe Council membership
should be expanded in both the permanent and the non-
permanent categories to take into account the lack of
sufficient representation of developing countries in the
Asia-Pacific, African and Latin American regions. We
also believe that Japan and Germany should be
seriously considered for permanent membership, with
equal privileges and obligations. Consideration may be
given to other countries with appropriate qualifications
and integrity, particularly from the developing world.
We also commend the indications from the Panel
that the definition of “hard” versus “soft” threats is no
longer relevant. That will allow a proper and objective
discussion to be held, given that the resonance of
perceived threats can be viewed differently depending
on where the threat is.
That said, Papua New Guinea believes that
reform of the United Nations system should be
comprehensive and that the General Assembly should
regain its pre-eminent role as the principal organ of the
United Nations. That will enable all Member States,
large and small, to engage more meaningfully in
addressing all challenges in an effective way in order
to help the United Nations fulfil its role in the pursuit
of a peaceful, just and prosperous world. That is the
purpose for which the United Nations was established.
As we move towards next year’s review of the
Millennium Development Goals and the sixtieth
anniversary of the United Nations, we should all look
at the dire needs of the majority of humanity. My
delegation believes that the Millennium Development
Goals provide the blueprint for achieving those
objectives.
Finally, let me conclude by reaffirming Papua
New Guinea’s support for the one-China policy, which
provides the sound basis for our bilateral relations with
the People’s Republic of China."
4554,59,2004,NRU,"It gives me great
pleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of His
Excellency Ludwig Scotty, President of the Republic of
Nauru, who had to cancel his trip to New York at the
last minute due to pressing matters at home. President
Scotty has asked that I convey to the Assembly the
warm greetings and good wishes of the people and the
Government of Nauru, and his warmest congratulations
to you, Sir, on your assumption of the stewardship of
the Assembly. We assure you of Nauru’s fullest
cooperation in the deliberations that are ahead of us.
Through you, Mr. President, my delegation joins
previous speakers in congratulating Foreign Minister
Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia for a productive fifty-
eighth session of the General Assembly and for his
exemplary performance. As a member of the Alliance
of Small Island States (AOSIS), Nauru is extremely
proud to be associated with Saint Lucia and the
Caribbean Community, and it just goes to show that, as
is the case of our coconut trees, our potential is great.
However, a lack of resources has limited the capacity
to flourish of many more people like Julian Hunte from
the AOSIS region who are serving or have served in
international office.
We congratulate the Secretary-General for his
continued commitment to multilateralism as a means of
resolving our common problems and for his report on
the work of the Organization (A/59/1) over the past 12
months. However, it is discouraging to note that
peacekeeping activities have had to increase rather than
decrease. Human rights and humanitarian norms
continue to be violated as a result of armed conflict and
terrorism. Atrocious acts of terrorism against innocent
civilians, particularly women and children, continue to
tear the fabric of civility and the moral values on which
each and every society on this planet is founded.
Nauru sympathizes with those countries and
peoples who have suffered loss as a result of conflict
and terrorist acts. Nauru encourages peace in its Asia-
Pacific neighbourhood, and expresses the hope that,
whatever their differences, China and Taiwan can
resolve them peacefully for the sake of the region’s
continued peace, stability and prosperity.
We support the Secretary-General’s bold
statement of position with respect to the mitigation of
armed conflicts generally, and those on the African
continent and in the Middle East in particular. We are
pleased to hear that, for the remainder of his term in
22

office, he will be focusing mainly on strengthening the
rule of law and transitional justice. Nauru supports the
position the Secretary-General set out in his statement
last week at the 3rd meeting, when he said
“It is by reintroducing the rule of law, and
confidence in its impartial application, that we
can hope to resuscitate societies shattered by
conflict. It is the law, including Security Council
resolutions, which offers the best foundation for
resolving prolonged conflicts — in the Middle
East, in Iraq and around the world.”
The democratization of governance, the
application of accountability and transparency and the
protection of minorities and the vulnerable are
complementary elements of ruling under law.
Nauru, like other Member States, looks forward
with anticipation to the report of the Secretary-General
on the findings of the High-level Panel on Threats,
Challenges and Change to be finalized later this year.
The Panel has been charged with the task of reviewing
threats to peace and security, as well as other global
challenges, insofar as they may influence or connect
with those threats. Nauru continues to believe that
multilateralism is the key to resolving contemporary
problems in all of their complexity. Hence, it is
important that the recommendations of the High-level
Panel reinforce that point and that the proposals are
doable and add value to the reform programmes that
are already in the pipeline, including the revitalization
of the General Assembly.
My delegation has stated in previous debates that
it agrees fully with the reform of the Security Council.
The fresh approach initiated by the President of the
General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session has, to
some extent, injected life back into the debate by
focusing on key elements of the reform. It is our hope
that the Bureau will continue the push for the further
convergence of views by refining the choices that we
made during the fifty-eighth session. The formation of
an informal group of countries with aspirations to
permanent seats in an expanded Security Council is
interesting, and could prove to be a catalyst, expediting
the debate on expansion. Nauru can and will support
the aspirations of Germany, Japan and India to a
permanent seat in an expanded Security Council.
It is my delegation’s firm view, however, that
progress is being held hostage by those countries that
insist that the expansion should not be done without
either eliminating or modifying the veto power
accorded to permanent members of the Security
Council. Unless this difference in approach is
reconciled, time and energy spent on other elements of
the reform will be futile.
The revitalization of the General Assembly must
have at its heart the maximization of opportunity for
equitable representation by all Member States in the
major organs of the United Nations and its committees
and to ensure that their programme of work allows for
the full participation of members, particularly the small
States. In that regard, the proposal to split the work of
the Main Committees of the General Assembly into
two segments over a six-month period would allow
small States like Nauru, which has only two diplomatic
staff, to increase its participation. Nauru would
therefore support such a proposal when further
deliberations take place later in the session.
Nauru would note that its position is consistent
with the United Nations core principle of universality,
which calls on us all to be ever-mindful of the views of
those countries seeking expanded responsibilities in
international affairs. Countries that have sterling
records in democracy, human rights, peace and the
principle of freedom should have their achievements,
as well as their capacities, appropriately recognized.
As a small island developing State in the Pacific
Ocean, Nauru aligns itself with the interventions
already made by the leaders of countries of the
Alliance of Small Island States who have spoken
before me on the concerns and challenges that we, the
small-island big-ocean developing States, are facing.
Nauru bears all the unique characteristics of a small
island State: smallness in both land area and
population, lack of resources, remoteness and
vulnerability to exogenous forces, whether man-made
or natural.
The devastation of Niue by Cyclone Heta and the
disastrous hurricane destruction in Caribbean countries
this year are stark reminders of the vulnerability of
island States. Nauru joins others in expressing its
deepest sympathy for the loss of life and property in
the affected countries of the Caribbean and the
southern coastal states of the United States of America.
Against that background, my delegation would
like to focus on what it considers to be a spanner in the
wheel of negotiations on an outcome strategy paper for
the International Meeting to Review the
23

Implementation of the Programme of Action for the
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States, to be held in Mauritius. It appears to us that the
programme for political recognition of the special case
of small island developing States (SIDS), as outlined at
the Barbados Conference in 1994, and reinforced in
New York during the five-year review held in 1999, as
well as in chapter VII of the Johannesburg Plan of
Implementation, has taken a backseat in the
negotiations to generic undertakings made at other
international conferences on development since
1999 — in particular, the Millennium Development
Goals of 2000 and the Monterrey Consensus of 2002.
Benchmarking the SIDS outcome strategy paper to the
latter agreed texts would be hypocrisy of a high order
insofar as political acceptance of SIDS as a special
case is concerned. Indeed, the slow progress in the
implementation by many small island developing
States of the measures called for in those texts is but a
true reflection that our problems are SIDS-specific and
go deeper than the generic issues of development.
Nauru is also concerned that some of the
development partners would skew the review into one
addressing SIDS-Millennium Development Goal
performance instead of SIDS performance on the
Barbados Programme of Action. I believe that our
concern has to an extent been warranted and therefore
my delegation would like to use this opportunity to
remind our partners that the review is about identifying
and solving the failure of small island developing
States to accomplish agreed development programmes
under the Barbados Plan of 1994; and it’s about how
you, our development partners, can help SIDS to attain
those goals. It is therefore our sincere hope that the
third and critical round of negotiations scheduled in
early October will be conducted in the right spirit and
with better understanding.
The Pacific Islands Forum continues to be the
vehicle for regional cooperation and collaboration
among the 16 Pacific Island countries of the Central
and Western Pacific. It approved the terms of reference
for the Pacific plan at the Apia Forum last month to
revitalize the Forum and to make it more effective in
its response to the needs of the peoples of the region.
Issues such as climate change, peace and security, the
economic and social development of our peoples and
the protection and sustainable use of the environment
and our natural resources are still the priorities of the
Forum.
Nauru welcomes the admission of the Kingdom
of Thailand as the thirteenth member of the Forum’s
dialogue partners. That group of countries, along with
the European Union, individual member countries of
the EU and the United Nations specialized agencies
and programmes, are critical to the development of the
region as they provide the necessary financial backing.
During the session, cooperation between the United
Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum will be
considered under item 56 (q) of the General
Assembly’s agenda. The Pacific Island Forum group at
the United Nations looks forward to working closely
with Member States to develop and expand the areas of
its cooperation with them, pursuant to a draft
resolution that will be presented to the Assembly in
due course.
Nauru, like the other low-lying small island
States, sees the Kyoto Protocol as its means of
salvation from the sea-level rise and climate change
that threaten to devastate its already fragile ecosystem,
so essential to the livelihood and culture of its people.
My delegation understands that the Russian Federation
stands between the Kyoto Protocol’s coming into force
and its continuing to linger in the wilderness. Nauru
welcomes the statement by the Foreign Minister of the
Russian Federation that President Putin has ordered
serious consideration of Russia’s ratification of the
Protocol. That is a step forward from last year.
A healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable use
of its natural resources, including the highly migratory
fish stocks, are also critical to our livelihood. We in the
Pacific have “walked the walk” on those issues by the
development of an ocean policy to guide us in the
management of our part of the Pacific Ocean and to
form the framework for future regional ocean-related
initiatives. The Convention on the Conservation and
Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the
Western and Central Pacific Ocean, which provides a
comprehensive regime for the management of the
region’s highly migratory fish stock both in our
exclusive economic zone and on the high seas, has
come into force. In addition, the trans-shipment of
nuclear waste through our waters is of great concern to
many of the island countries because of the damage it
could cause.
One of the positive outcomes of the Pacific
Islands Forum meeting last month was the decision of
the Forum leaders to intervene in the internal economic
crisis in Nauru at the request of our Government and
24

consistent with the terms of reference of the Forum’s
Biketawa Declaration of 2000. Our crisis lies largely in
the fact that two thirds of our workforce are in the
employ of the Government and its agencies. Those
employees have not been paid a regular salary for over
a year now. At irregular intervals either A$ 100 in food
vouchers or A$ 30 to A$ 50 in cash to purchase food
has been paid out, compared with the basic wage of
A$ 350 — or about US$ 250 — per fortnight. The
average family size on Nauru is around six people. A$
50 cash fortnightly is equivalent to US$ 0.42 per
family member per day and is well below the United
Nations-defined abject poverty level of US$ 1 a day.
The fact that many Nauruans can harvest food
from the sea and the land, however limited, coupled
with our culture and tradition of sharing, has meant
that despite the lack of cash our people eat at least once
a day. The real problem concerns the level of daily
nutritional intake, particularly for children, as one
cannot buy imported commodities such as fruits and
vegetables and hygienic supplies. The situation is
exacerbated by the fact that Nauru imports 90 per cent
of all food and other essential items. Accordingly, food
security in the medium to long term is a serious
concern as there is no form of agricultural activity on
Nauru.
Nauru’s recovery cannot be possible without the
establishment of reputable financial institutions on
Nauru and the lifting of the restrictions on financial
transactions between the international community and
Nauru. That will not happen if Nauru continues to be
subjected to countermeasures and blacklisting by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Despite the
outlawing of the registration of foreign banks some 12
months ago, Nauru has not been successful in its
appeal no longer to be the subject of countermeasures
as a first step, although there has been incremental
progress towards that goal over the same period.
Following the visit by the International Monetary Fund
early this year, Nauru has, for the fourth time, passed
an anti-money-laundering law that now supersedes
previous laws. We have participated in FATF regional
reviews but, despite strong support provided by actions
taken on advice, we seem to have failed at the plenary
review.
As I speak, the Parliament of Nauru is
considering the passage of three bills addressing issues
raised by the FATF: the counter-terrorism and
transnational organized crime bill, the proceeds of
crime bill and the mutual assistance in criminal matters
bill. We are confident that the passage of those bills,
the prioritizing of related issues through the
appointment of an anti-money-laundering national
coordinating committee — which also comprises the
Australian official appointed as secretary for
finance — and the coordinating committee’s face-to-
face meeting with FATF’s Asia-Pacific Working Group
in Brunei next week will bring us closer to our
objective of being de-listed. We will persevere, as we
know that, in the end, we will prevail.
The intervention by the Pacific Islands Forum is
seen as pre-empting the possibility of the economic
crisis escalating into a security and safety issue for the
Nauruan people and for the region. Teams of regional
experts representing the Forum and Australia have
visited Nauru on a fact-finding mission, and we will be
reporting to the leaders in due course, which will
include recommendations on the type of assistance and
the manner in which it should be rendered. While the
proposal, which is to be formally known as Pacific
Regional Assistance to Nauru, is being finalized, the
Forum has agreed to provide, in the immediate future,
capacity-building assistance in the justice, judicial,
financial audit and national planning sectors, as well as
transportation for the health and education sectors and
a small cash grant to assist with public-sector wages.
That assistance is complementing the aid
provided separately by Australia, which has deployed
Australian finance and treasury officials to head the
Nauru Department of Finance, and the deployment,
next month, of Australian police to take command of
the Nauru Police Force. Indeed, as I speak, the
Parliament of Nauru is also considering a reform
budget designed with the assistance of Australian
finance and treasury officials. That budget includes
harsh but realistic measures as a preliminary but
decisive step towards stabilizing, and eventually
rebuilding, the economy and society of Nauru.
For the same reasons, the Government of Nauru
wrote to the Secretary-General in August of this year to
alert him of the looming crisis in Nauru and to request
assistance from the United Nations system to help to
alleviate the plight of the Nauruan people. President
Ludwig Scotty and Foreign Minister David Adeang
may be visiting New York in the latter part of October
to meet with the Secretary-General and relevant United
Nations bodies on this matter. My Government looks
forward to receiving a positive response from the
25

United Nations system, in the same manner as it did
from the Pacific Islands Forum.
In conclusion, the fifty-ninth session has critical
work ahead of it, such as the International Meeting for
the 10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of
Action, the introduction and deliberation on the
findings of the High-Level Panel constituted by the
Secretary-General, the review of the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the
preparations for the 5-year review of the Millennium
Declaration and its Goals and the continuation of our
deliberations on the revitalization of the General
Assembly and of the reform of the Security Council, to
name but a few items.
As the Secretary-General has stated, the United
Nations is at a fork in the road in terms of its relevance
as an organization of nations seeking common
solutions to common problems. The next 12 months
will determine whether we, the united nations of the
world, continue on the road where “business as usual”
is the mode of operation or whether we follow the road
of multilateralism as the principal rule of our
engagement. The statements thus far indicate the latter,
but we have heard that before."
4615,59,2004,NZL,"Fifty-nine years ago the
United Nations was established by nations determined
to work collectively to find alternatives to conflict as a
means of resolving disputes and to create a stable,
secure and more just and prosperous world. Devastated
and exhausted by world war for the second time within
25 years, nations put their faith in multilateralism and
in this body in order to avoid future wars. The name
'United Nations' evoked the unity of humankind, in
which our shared needs and common humanity were
more important than our differences.
It is obvious as we consider the world today that
we have achieved that vision only in part. Yes, world
wars have been avoided. International covenants have
set out universally agreed human rights standards
against which the performance of governments can be
measured. International law has been developed and
strengthened. As Kofi Annan emphasized this morning
(see ), putting the rule of law into effect at
home and internationally is essential to achieving a
fair, just and civilized world. Cooperation has achieved
advances in meeting social, economic and
environmental needs.
But much more remains to be done. War, more
often within than across the boundaries of States, has
taken the lives of tens of millions of people since 1945,
most of them civilians. Weapons of mass destruction
have accumulated and access to them has spread to
more countries. New diseases such as HIV/AIDS have
emerged, with devastating consequences. The gap
between rich and poor countries has widened, not
diminished.
This year the Secretary-General's High-Level
Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change will put
forward proposals for reforming and strengthening the
United Nations, aimed at ensuring its relevance and
effectiveness in addressing these issues. It is critical
that we seize this unique opportunity to institute
positive reforms and not squander it by adopting
narrow, self-interested and inflexible responses. Nor
will a lowest-common-denominator approach achieve
what we all require.
Reform is long overdue. The composition of the
Security Council cannot go on reflecting the world as it
was in 1945. An expanded Security Council and reform
of outmoded electoral groupings is necessary for the
Council to be representative of the international
community as it is today. Those changes will
strengthen the Councilís mandate and enhance its
credibility as the pre-eminent organ of the United
Nations. No solution, of course, will satisfy the
viewpoint of every Member nation. A willingness to
compromise on a package of proposals will be
essential. But clearly, enhancing the representation of
areas such as Asia, Latin America and Africa must be
an objective, and account must be taken of the
significant contributions to the United Nations of
nations such as Japan.
While the High-Level Panel will focus on reform
of the United Nations and security considerations,
development goals to create a fairer world and promote
economic and social progress in the developing world
are further vital considerations for the United Nations
in the year ahead. For hundreds of millions of people,
starvation, disease and poverty are more immediate
threats than the concerns others of us have about
terrorism and security.
We are now at a turning point in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals. Improving the quality
and quantity of development assistance is crucial.
However, real and lasting progress to meet
development challenges is also dependent on building
a fairer, more open and equitable global trading
system. Countries of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) spend
$360 billion each year on subsidizing agricultural
47

production in a way that excludes opportunities for the
developing world to export - not only to OECD
countries, but to third markets as well. That sum
dwarfs the amount the OECD countries provide in
development assistance.
New Zealand welcomes the progress made at the
World Trade Organization General Council meeting in
Geneva in July, which put the Doha Development
Agenda back on track. Agriculture is at the heart of the
round; the European Union and United States
agreement to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies
is particularly welcome.
The United Nations must also adapt itself to the
changing nature of security and humanitarian concerns.
The concept of national sovereignty being paramount
and standing in the way of international intervention in
local conflicts cannot be sustained. As the Secretary-
General has challenged us,
'if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an
unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should
we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica - to
gross and systematic violations of human rights
that offend every precept of our common
humanity?' (A/54/2000, para. 217)
The International Commission on Intervention
and State Sovereignty concluded two and a half years
ago that sovereign States have the responsibility to
protect their own citizens from avoidable catastrophe:
from mass murder and rape, from starvation. When
they are unwilling or unable to do so, that
responsibility must be borne by the broader community
of nations.
We are today witnessing a humanitarian and
human rights catastrophe in Darfur. The World Health
Organization reports that up to 10,000 people a month
are dying or being killed. The very young and the
elderly are most vulnerable.
A few days ago, by its resolution 1564 (2004), the
Security Council resolved to support an enlarged
African Union monitoring mission, demanded that all
parties cease all violence and human rights violations
and threatened further steps against the Government of
the Sudan if it fails to disarm the militias and protect
civilians.
Within the General Assembly, countries must
work together in a united and determined way to
enforce those provisions and prevent the tragedy that is
unfolding. History will not forgive those who stand in
the way of protecting 1.5 million refugees in that
region and allowing them to return safely to their
homes. It is also important that those responsible for
the mass murders and the abuse of human rights there
be held to account for their actions. There must be no
impunity for such crimes.
That is true in Darfur, and is also true of those
responsible for the destruction of East Timor and the
murder of people there in 1999. The ad hoc tribunals in
Indonesia have failed to bring to justice those who are
responsible. That failure can only encourage such
people to commit further atrocities, believing that they
will never be held responsible for their actions.
New Zealand welcomes the establishment of the
International Criminal Court and the role that it will
now play in dealing with genocide, war crimes and
crimes against humanity. It urges all countries which
have not yet done so to accede to the convention
establishing that body and to recognize its jurisdiction.
In the area of conflict resolution, we face today
two major challenges: in Afghanistan and in Iraq. New
Zealand has strongly supported efforts to bring security
and stability to Afghanistan. As a small country we
have contributed more than NZ$80 million in military
and development assistance. We welcome progress
towards presidential elections next month and the
essential democratic mandate that they will provide to
the Government.
Strong international support, however, will be
necessary to meet the challenges which lie ahead. That
includes ending the production and trading of drugs.
Afghanistan provides about 75 per cent of the world
trade in opiates. The money derived funds warlords
and organized crime and undermines the ability of the
legitimate Government to function.
New Zealand deplores the violence in Iraq, which
continues to harm or take the lives of so many people,
and the circumstances which have contributed to that
violence. We call on those responsible for taking the
lives of innocent people to end their violence. They
now have access to a political process which they
should use to promote their views and interests. A
credible election process is vital to creating an Iraqi
Government which has a popular mandate. The United
Nations has a key role to play in that process, but
adequate security and a safe environment are first
necessary for that to occur. New Zealand will continue
48

to support the interim Iraqi authority and the United
Nations in their efforts to restore security, peace and
prosperity to the Iraqi people, who have suffered for so
long.
In Iraq and elsewhere, close attention also needs
to be given to the protection of United Nations staff.
The General Assembly this year will consider an
integrated security strategy for the United Nations,
which will incorporate a system-wide review of the
United Nations security apparatus, accountability and
resources. The Convention on the Safety of United
Nations and Associated Personnel must be
strengthened and supported by all States Members of
the United Nations.
New Zealand condemns all acts of terrorism and
will continue to contribute strongly to the campaign
against terrorism. In particular, we condemn the
inhumanity of terrorists in Beslan who sacrificed
children as pawns in pursuit of their political
objectives. However, attempts to suppress terrorism by
force will not by themselves be enough unless we also
address the causes which drive people to support,
finance or be recruited into terrorism.
In that regard, no action will be more important
to the undermining of terrorism today than finding a
just and sustainable solution to the conflict between
Israel and the Palestinian people. The international
community must work with those countries to
overcome the failure of leadership, the lack of resolve
and the cycle of violence and retaliation which stand in
the way of solving that conflict.
Finally, in the Pacific region, New Zealand's own
neighbourhood, we can celebrate the progress which
has been made in Bougainville and in the Solomon
Islands in ending conflict and re-establishing the rule
of law. In both cases, a concerted regional response
with the support of the United Nations has been
effective. In Bougainville, that response created peace
from a situation where a 10-year civil war had resulted
in widespread devastation and the loss of thousands of
lives.
In the Solomon Islands, the intervention of the
Regional Assistance Mission has restored the rule of
law by its elected Government in place of the anarchy
created by armed militias. More than 3,500 weapons
have been collected and destroyed, social services and
a credible budgetary progress restored and militiamen
and corrupt elements from the police and Government
arrested and charged.
Much however, remains to be done to meet the
wide-ranging challenges which confront the Pacific
region, including environmental threats, ethnic
conflict, poor law enforcement and governance and the
threat of disease. Regional solutions are being applied
by the Pacific Islands Forum through greater
collaboration and integration in addressing problems.
International cooperation through processes such as the
10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of Action
set to take place in Mauritius next year will also help.
In conclusion, 59 years from the end of the
Second World War and the establishment of the United
Nations, the world continues to face major challenges
to its security and well-being. The opportunity exists
this year for us to consider and improve the ways by
which the Assembly can address the problems faced by
humanity and make a difference. Success or failure to
do so will be the collective responsibility of all of us."
4626,59,2004,PLW,"This is a momentous
year for our country as we celebrate, on 1 October, the
tenth anniversary of our independence and our
membership in this institution. Palau was the last
country to emerge from the Trusteeship System, having
been administered by the United States under the
supervision of the United Nations longer than any
country in the world. It was the United Nations that
provided Palau with a willing forum in which to
express and ultimately achieve our right to sovereignty,
and for that we are ever thankful. I am also happy to
observe, on this tenth anniversary, that this year we
established, for the first time, a permanent mission in
New York so that we can enhance our ability to meet
our international responsibilities.
It was the United States, through its
administration and willing cooperation during our
peaceful emergence into independence, that assured us
the liberty and the values that guide us today. For that
extraordinary legacy, we today express our deep
gratitude to the United States of America.
This is a good year for Palau to deepen its
involvement, since it coincides with the worldís
preparation for the Mauritius conference and the
increased emphasis at the United Nations on the unique
challenges facing small island developing States.
While images of swaying palm trees and white sand
beaches prevail in the world's imagination, they are
only part of the story. In truth and in fact, the
remoteness and the isolation of Palau make it a very
difficult place to develop a self-reliant economy,
provide medical care and education to its people and
deter aggression and terrorism. Fuel and transportation
prices are among the highest in the world. After four
successive colonial administrations, our infrastructure
is quite incomplete, and our most promising hope for
the development of a sustainable economy, our pristine
environment, is threatened by factors beyond our
control, such as the failure of all industrialized
countries to reach agreement on implementing the
Kyoto Protocol.
We have created a democratic society and
ensured human rights for our people, but without
international focus, we will not be able to provide hope
and opportunity to our children, and we will continue
to watch as they leave their homeland to seek an
education and a career elsewhere. For no matter what
statistics may be advanced, what references to gross
national product may be debated, until we can provide
our children with the incentive to stay and help build
our country, we will have lost. Thus, the Mauritius
process is critical for Palau, and we trust that the
developed countries of the world will embrace it.
21

Similarly, we trust that United Nations agencies
will sharpen their focus on the small island developing
States and correct what we view as a current
imbalance, in support of the fragile small States of the
world. We applaud the recent efforts of the Global
Environmental Facility (GEF) to streamline assistance
to Palau through the creation of an innovative North
Pacific subregional programme that will build our
capacity to protect our environment and create a
sustainable economy.
We are troubled, however, by a growing tendency
in the donor community to demand that small countries
like ours prove our capacity before assistance can be
delivered. This is a catch-22 situation that threatens to
halt our development. The only way we can build our
capacity to execute projects that will save, for example,
our unique biodiversity is to experience the hard work
of completing projects and learning from our
experience.
This observation does not mean that we are
reluctant to accept the obligations and responsibilities
inherent in receiving assistance. We are willing and
eager to be monitored by the international community
in our performance. We firmly believe that we should
be held accountable for the quality and the
transparency of our efforts.
It is ironic that tiny countries such as ours, where
so many of the worldís environmental treasures exist,
are denied the assistance they need due to a perceived
lack of capacity to navigate the unwieldy bureaucracies of
the international organizations charged with protecting
those very treasures.
As already noted, the failure of the world to come
to agreement on implementing the Kyoto Protocol will
contribute to the destruction of our marine and
terrestrial resources. Palau, like many other small
island developing States, is a window on the worldís
future in this regard and must be carefully observed.
We urge the GEF to create real funding opportunities
for adaptation and mitigation measures in a proactive
and streamlined fashion before it is too late.
In a similar vein, we are increasingly aware of the
particularly damaging fishing practice of deep-sea
bottom trawling. Increasingly employed on the high
seas as coastal fisheries are depleted, this technique
entails dragging heavy equipment along the seabed,
completely destroying established coral, sponge and
related communities that have taken centuries to
develop. We are a culture of fishing people and find
this practice unacceptable. As we participated with our
Pacific colleagues in eliminating drift-net fishing some
years ago, we now call upon the world to join us in
declaring a moratorium on deep sea bottom trawling
before this practice does any more irremediable damage.
Last month, Palauís accession to the Group of
Asian States created the largest regional grouping in
the United Nations. Two critical issues involving our
Asian region also have great global significance.
First, for the United Nations to be effective at
ensuring international peace and security, all nations,
large and small, should be represented in its
deliberations. The Republic of China on Taiwan should
no longer be kept on the sidelines of the most
important international Organization. The principle of
universality should be applied so that the 23 million
people of Taiwan can bring their talents, their energy
and their principled democratic positions to the
organizations, bodies, specialized agencies and
programmes of the United Nations, thereby aiding the
rest of the world in pursuing our mutual agenda.
Secondly, and also in pursuit of the most effective
means to strengthen the credibility of the United
Nations, Palau urges the United Nations to reform the
Security Council to reflect the reality of the
international community in the twenty-first century so
that countries that play a major role in the maintenance
of international peace and security always participate
in the decision-making process of the Security Council.
Palau believes that the Security Council should be
expanded to include additional developing and
developed countries as new members, and that Japanís
stellar record of contribution is a solid basis for Japanís
assumption of permanent membership of the Security
Council. Japan has been a leader in international
initiatives for many years, and it is for that reason that
Palau takes this strongly felt position.
Much of my presentation today has focused on
the enormous threats to vulnerable island States like
Palau. We agree with the Secretary-General, who
observed in his opening remarks to the high-level
segment of the twelfth session of the Commission on
Sustainable Development, held at United Nations
Headquarters from 28 to 30 April 2004, that ìhigh-
level political attention has been diverted from
sustainable development by the recent emphasis given
to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and the war
in Iraq. But Palau also understands that the scourge of
global terrorism and its immoral violence against
innocent people must be defeated. We are proud of our
sons and daughters serving in the United States
military. Only last week, one of those sons, a Marine
fighting side by side with Coalition forces in Iraq, paid
the ultimate price, marking the first death of a Palauan
in the struggle with global terrorism. Our forces are
small in number but, like Corporal Ngirmidol, large in
loyalty, commitment and idealism. No one should
make any mistake about that.
Palau is grateful to the United States for allowing
us to achieve our independence and thus to join the
international communityís quest for world peace.
Nonetheless, a balanced international agenda which
includes a determined focus on sustainable development
is required if Palau is to achieve some measure of
economic self-reliance, and if the world as we know it
is to survive."
4635,59,2004,KIR,"It is with great pleasure that I
bring warm greetings from the Government and people
of Kiribati on whose behalf I have the honour to
address the Assembly today.
Before I begin, I would like to extend our
congratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his election to the
presidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General
Assembly. We have every confidence in his able
leadership to guide the work of the Assembly and to
deliver conclusive outcomes. He has our full support
and cooperation in carrying out his work. I wish also to
thank the President’s predecessor for the excellent
work he has done in steering the work of the Assembly
during the past year. My congratulations also go to the
Secretary-General for his sterling leadership of our
Organization during these trying times and for rising
commendably to the challenge.
We gather again this year amidst the reality of
daunting challenges that continue to confront us as
individual nations and as a global community. The
ongoing conflicts in Iraq and other parts of the world,
the scourge of terrorism and the existence of nuclear
arsenals, accelerated environmental degradation and
the threat of global warming and sea-level rise, hunger
and poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other non-
communicable diseases, the marginalization of the
least developed countries within the global economy
and underdevelopment, all continue to pose major
challenges that our Organization must address today.
Those challenges cast a dark shadow over the
commitments made by world leaders at the Millennium
Summit held here in New York four years ago,
pledging to work collectively to maintain peace and
security, to eliminate poverty and to promote
development for the benefit of all mankind in the new
millennium.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons
continue to threaten international security. We must be
unified in our approach and address those challenges
effectively by strengthening multilateral disarmament
and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and
through closer regional and international cooperation.
Kiribati supports all non-proliferation efforts and in
that respect is party to, among others, the Treaty on the
2

Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the
Chemical Weapons Convention.
We commend and support the work of the
international community and efforts taken at the
national, regional and international levels to respond to
the challenges of terrorism, recognizing the need for
international solidarity in addressing that increasing
global threat.
Kiribati is committed to the global fight against
terrorism. Terrorism knows no boundaries and we
cannot claim immunity from it. Indeed, as a small
island developing State we have very little capacity to
develop any effective countermeasures and are
therefore especially vulnerable to terrorism.
We acknowledge the importance of complying
with United Nations resolutions and international
security arrangements that have been adopted in the
fight against terrorism. While we cannot afford to be
complacent in our efforts in that regard, it must be
recognized that the requirements for compliance with
those resolutions and arrangements do pose enormous
challenges for countries such as Kiribati. Our limited
resources and technical capacity are already committed
to providing for the basic and essential social and
economic needs of our rapidly growing population,
thus placing severe constraints on our ability to make
progress in compliance. I would like to note, however,
that, with technical assistance from our development
partners, we have made progress in enacting important
legislation relating to terrorism and transnational
crime. We expect to make further progress on
compliance with the counter-terrorism requirements
shortly.
The progress made so far has revolved primarily
around the introduction of legislation. We recognize
that this is just the beginning of the process. The
implementation and enforcement of the legislation
enacted will pose an immense challenge. In this
respect, we will continue to count on the assistance and
support of the international community.
We note with deep regret and concern the loss of
life and devastation to property caused by the recent
series of hurricanes affecting the Caribbean and the
Atlantic coast of the United States. We offer our deep
sympathy to those affected by those natural disasters.
The adverse impact of climate change and sea-
level rise is, indeed, a critical security issue for the
global community in this new millennium, especially
for low-lying island States like Kiribati. That issue
must take centre stage with other international security
issues. We urge the international community to agree
on a unified global response in order to better protect
the environment, in the same way that the international
community is being encouraged to respond to terrorism
and other threats to global security. Our inability as a
global community to agree on a unified stand on
climate change and sea-level rise is very disappointing
indeed, and we deplore the notion that economic
growth must take precedence over environmental
issues at any cost. Our very existence as a State —
indeed, the existence all States similar to Kiribati — is
at stake if such thinking continues to prevail.
I would like at this juncture to express our
gratitude to the many countries that have ratified the
Kyoto Protocol and to appeal to those that have not to
do so as a matter of urgency. We have demonstrated
remarkable solidarity in the fight against global
terrorism. Can we not demonstrate the same solidarity
in the fight against climate change and sea-level rise?
Regional cooperation has been a very effective
mechanism in addressing the many challenges faced by
countries in our region. Regional cooperation has
enabled many Pacific countries to meet some of the
counter-terrorism requirements. Regional cooperation
has also enabled us to effectively address emerging
issues confronting our region; the outstanding success
of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands
is a clear demonstration of that.
We in the Pacific are confident of our ability to
steer a course for the future. We have approved work to
commence on a Pacific plan that will promote
collective action in the areas of security, good
governance, economic growth and sustainable
development. We envisage that the Pacific plan will
result in the delivery of tangible benefits to our
respective peoples and communities.
We recognize the need for, and welcome,
strengthened cooperation and the development of
closer linkages and partnerships between the United
Nations and its specialized agencies and other
organizations, including the Pacific Islands Forum.
Such linkages and partnerships can only result in the
more effective, coordinated and harmonized delivery of
assistance to member countries.
Making progress with regard to the development
aspirations of our peoples is a high — if not the
highest — priority for many of us who are here today.
Our national policy objective is to achieve the
3

equitable distribution of development benefits to all
our peoples, based on the principles of good
governance. We are committed to the Millennium
Declaration and are on track in our national efforts to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
The Goals have been integrated and
mainstreamed into our national development strategy.
We are committed to pursuing those goals as the basis
of sustainable development. In this connection, I would
like to express our appreciation to all our development
partners, who, over the years, have contributed
meaningfully to the realization of our development
aspirations.
While we are grateful for the assistance extended
by our development partners, there is scope for us to
achieve more for our peoples — and to do so without
development assistance. Kiribati has a large exclusive
economic zone that has an abundant fisheries resource.
Those resources are presently being harvested by
vessels from distant-water fishing nations under license
arrangements. However, the return from these licensing
arrangements is negligible, at only around 5 per cent of
the landed value of the catch.
Naturally, we would like to see greater returns
from that resource. Our ability to achieve sustainable
economic development depends on it. Accordingly, we
urge the flag States of those fishing interests to
encourage their industries to explore the mutual
benefits to be gained from collaboration with resource
owners in establishing on-shore facilities that will add
value to the commodity. We believe that such a model
will also result in easing the pressure on fish stocks
and ensure conservation of the resource for the
sustainable benefit of mankind.
The entry into force in June this year of the
Western and Central Pacific Tuna Convention
represents a major development in the management of
the western and central Pacific tuna fishery.
In this age of rapid globalization, advances in
information technology and trade liberalization, it is
regrettable that, while some are reaping the full
benefits of those advances and developments,
significantly more remain on the fringes. The reality is
that a large proportion of the world’s population, most
of whom live in developing countries, continue to live
in poverty and are marginalized in trading
arrangements and market access opportunities. The
promise of globalization and open trading as a positive
force for economic growth, and social progress
continues to elude the many. Much work needs to be
done to ensure that the many also enjoy the benefits of
globalization.
Kiribati supports the findings of the report of the
World Commission on the Social Dimension of
Globalization. We urge that the findings of the report
be taken into consideration and incorporated into the
work of the Assembly, especially for the 2005 high-
level review of the outcome of the Millennium
Summit.
We welcome the United Nations support for the
convening, early next year in Mauritius, of the
International Meeting for the 10-Year Review of the
Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable
Development of Small Island Developing States. Like
other small island developing States, we attach great
importance to that review. With the continued support
and commitment of our development partners to the
process, we can be assured of important outcomes that
will go a long way in making a real difference to the
quality of life for our peoples.
We share the concerns of the international
community about the spread of HIV/AIDS and its
devastating impact as both a health crisis and a
development concern. We welcome the recent
developments in the search for affordable drugs for
HIV/AIDS victims in developing countries. We
encourage greater collaboration on HIV/AIDS research
and the mobilization of resources for prevention
activities and for better medical care for affected
patients.
We believe in the continuing relevance and
importance of the role of the United Nations and its
ability to respond to the challenges of our
contemporary world. In this regard, Kiribati welcomes
and fully supports the efforts to reform this
Organization to enable it to better respond to the
challenges of this era.
Given the crucial role of the Security Council in
the promotion of international peace and security and
the importance we attach to that issue, we see the
necessity for Security Council reform, including the
expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent
membership of the Council. Expansion is required to
better reflect the realities of our world today. We note
that some countries, including Japan, have consistently
committed substantial resources towards the
maintenance of global peace and security, and we
believe that they should be accorded permanent
membership on the Security Council.
4

We attach great importance to our membership in
this noble Organization, and we reaffirm our
commitment to upholding the noble values and
principles enshrined in the Charter of the United
Nations. The Charter epitomizes our hope for
achieving justice and equality and the safeguarding and
promotion of fundamental human rights of all peoples.
Within that context, we believe that the exclusionary
principles applied to Taiwan in its bid for United
Nations membership go against the very values and
objectives of the Charter that we all strive to uphold. In
this era of tension and conflict we should discard the
present exclusionary practices and adopt a more
embracing environment where all countries willing and
able to contribute to the international community’s
efforts to promote world peace and stability are
welcomed as equal partners. Taiwan has made and
continues to make notable contributions to the
development of many developing countries and has the
capacity to contribute constructively to the good work
of the United Nations. It is therefore regrettable that
the desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to again
become a part of that global community of nations
continues to be rejected.
The challenges that confront us at this point in
time are indeed daunting, but they are not
insurmountable. With renewed commitments and with
a common resolve to work in close cooperation and in
support of each other, we can succeed in creating a
more secure, a more prosperous and a more just world
for all in this millennium."
4653,59,2004,MHL,"I am honoured to address the
General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Allow me to extend my congratulations to you,
Mr. President, on your election, and to wish you well in
your endeavours throughout this session.
This year has seen important landmarks for the
Marshall Islands at the domestic level. On 1 May we
celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption
of our Constitution. The same day also marked the
entry into force of our amended Compact of Free
Association with the United States. The renewal of that
agreement reaffirms the special relationship between
our two countries.
At the regional level, we continue to place great
importance on our membership in the Pacific Islands
Forum. Over the past year, the Forum has conducted a
comprehensive review of existing regional
mechanisms. Last month Pacific leaders met in Samoa,
where they endorsed the terms of reference of a new
Pacific Plan, which will develop a strategy for broader
regional cooperation based on the key goals of
economic growth, sustainable development, good
governance and security.
At the international level, the Marshall Islands
reaffirms its solidarity with the Alliance of Small
Island States (AOSIS), which continues to act as a
powerful voice for small island developing States.
It has long been recognized that small island
developing States suffer from unique vulnerabilities
and disadvantages. In January 2005, the international
community will meet in Mauritius to conduct the
10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action
for the Sustainable Development of Small Island
Developing States. Over the past year, members of
AOSIS have been engaged in a detailed process of
preparation for the international meeting. At an
interregional meeting in January, small island
developing States adopted the AOSIS Strategy for the
Further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of
Action, which addresses critical issues including
climate change and sea-level rise, renewable energy,
trade access and others.
It is vital that we maintain the momentum in the
lead-up to Mauritius in order to ensure a successful
outcome for small island developing States. I
encourage the international community to become
engaged in the ongoing preparatory process and to
participate in the international meeting at the highest
level. It is our fervent hope that the meeting will
produce practical outcomes that will assist small island
developing States in implementing the Programme of
Action to benefit people at the local level.
In this increasingly globalized world, the
Marshall Islands faces challenges shared by many
other small island States. Our environment is extremely
vulnerable to the effects of climate change and natural
disasters; our small population faces the challenge of
managing high levels of major diseases such as
diabetes, and the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases; and our limited
resource base and remoteness restrict our ability to
integrate into the global economy.
With these challenges in mind, the Marshall
Islands is particularly concerned about the following
issues.
First, regarding sustainable development, the
Marshall Islands has developed a national sustainable
development strategy, and we are in the process of
establishing a task force to ensure that the Millennium
Development Goals are fully integrated into our
national strategy. In striving to achieve internationally
agreed development goals, we are severely constrained
by our lack of human and technical resources. Thus we
continue to seek to form partnerships that will assist us
through capacity-building and technology transfer.
We were pleased that the twelfth session of the
Commission on Sustainable Development focused on
water, sanitation and human settlements. We in the
Pacific region are working hard to improve access to
fresh water and to develop environmentally responsible
waste-management systems. We seek the support of the
international community to assist us in the
implementation of regional projects such as the Pacific
Regional Action Plan on Sustainable Water
Management. We look forward to the thirteenth session
of the Commission’s providing further policy guidance
in these areas.
23

An ongoing issue of the utmost concern for the
people of the Marshall Islands is that of nuclear-
weapon testing. Between 1946 and 1958, the United
States conducted a series of nuclear tests in the
Marshall Islands, which included the detonation of 23
atomic and hydrogen bombs. On 1 March this year we
commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Bravo
test at Bikini atoll. The Bravo blast was 1,000 times
more powerful than Hiroshima, and its fallout spread
radioactive debris across the neighbouring islands.
Today, many of our people continue to suffer
from the long-term health effects, while others remain
displaced from their homes because of ongoing
contamination. We urge the United States Government
to fully address the issue of adequate compensation for
populations affected by the nuclear testing programme
and to fulfil its responsibilities regarding the safe
resettlement of displaced populations.
On broader issues of disarmament and non-
proliferation, we urge the international community to
retain a focus on disarmament by the nuclear-weapon
States, as well as on non-proliferation measures. We
look forward to next year’s Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, and we hope that the Conference
will produce substantial progress on the 13 steps
towards complete nuclear disarmament.
I wish to reiterate our critical concern regarding
climate change. Along with other low-lying island
nations, we are most vulnerable to the impacts of
climate change. We are already experiencing these
dramatic effects: sea levels are rising, weather patterns
are changing and coral reef systems are being harmed.
Urgent action is needed at the global level to halt and
ultimately reverse the devastating impact of climate
change. Without such global action, our national efforts
at sustainable development will ultimately be rendered
meaningless.
While we are committed to playing our part,
strong leadership is required by the major
industrialized countries. We renew our support for the
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
Kyoto Protocol, and we call upon all States that have
not yet done so — in particular the major emitters — to
ratify the Protocol without further delay. We also call
upon the international community to assist small island
developing States in developing and implementing
comprehensive adaptation strategies.
As a nation whose livelihood depends on the
resources of the sea, we are becoming increasingly
concerned about the state of the world’s oceans and
fish stocks. At the regional level, we cooperate closely
with other members of the Pacific Islands Forum to
ensure that the oceans and marine resources in our
region are managed in a responsible and sustainable
manner. The Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy,
adopted in 2002, will be implemented throughout the
region under a recently developed framework for
integrated strategic action. Another notable
achievement in the region is the entry into force of the
Convention on the Conservation and Management of
Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and
Central Pacific Ocean.
While such developments are encouraging, we
reiterate our concerns regarding the prevalence of
illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Like many
other small island developing States, we rely on
fisheries resources as a primary means of survival, yet
we lack the capacity to adequately monitor our
exclusive economic zone. Regional and international
cooperation must focus on addressing the problem of
illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and
assisting small island developing States by building
capacity for monitoring and surveillance.
I have briefly mentioned a few of the major
priorities for the Marshall Islands. There are, of course,
many other important issues to be addressed during the
upcoming session.
International terrorism is obviously one of the
biggest challenges facing the global community today.
The reality is that no State or region is immune. All
States must take action at the national level and must
cooperate at the regional and international levels to
ensure that we combat terrorist threats with
comprehensive and unified action. Within the Pacific
region, we continue to cooperate closely to ensure that
effective regional action is taken to combat threats to
peace and security. At the national level, we are in the
process of implementing the 12 core anti-terrorism
conventions and the relevant Security Council
resolutions, and we have taken many steps to combat
money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Marshall Islands, as a State party to the
Rome Statute, welcomes the ongoing progress of the
International Criminal Court. We are pleased that the
Court is now fully operational and has begun its first
24

investigations. We are confident that the Court will
play a valuable role in the administration of justice at
the international level, and we urge those States that
have not yet done so to become parties.
Another issue requiring action by this body is the
continued exclusion of Taiwan from the United
Nations. Taiwan is a peace-loving, sovereign State, and
only its democratically elected Government can be the
legitimate representative of the interests of the people
of Taiwan within the United Nations. The Marshall
Islands reiterates its full support for the ongoing quest
of the people of Taiwan to be granted membership in
this global body and in various other international
organizations.
Finally, the Marshall Islands reiterates its support
for the expansion of the Security Council in both
categories of membership. We support the allocation of
a new permanent seat to Japan, and we believe that the
representation on the Council of developing countries
must be increased. Such expansion is crucial if the
Council is to retain its legitimacy.
My delegation looks forward, Mr. President, to a
productive session under your able leadership."
4655,59,2004,AUS,"Sir, let me begin by
congratulating you on your election as President of the
General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, and let me
20

say how honoured I am to be one of your Vice-
Presidents.
I want to say also how delighted Australia is to
welcome Iraq back to the General Assembly.
We, the nations of the world, gathered here at the
fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly, face
challenges to international security and prosperity that
are very different from those which existed at the birth
of the United Nations. However, the aims of the United
Nations as set out in the Preamble to the Charter
remain as relevant and vital today as they did then:
“to save successive generations from the scourge
of war … to reaffirm faith in fundamental human
rights ... to establish conditions under which
justice and respect for the obligations arising
from treaties and other sources of international
law can be maintained … and to promote social
progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom”.
Today, the menace of terrorism and the dangers of
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
cast their shadow across the globe, threatening not only
our security, but also the development gains and future
prosperity of all nations.
It is this new international environment, this new
reality, to which we must all adjust. The United
Nations is no exception. The United Nations is a vital
institution that does great humanitarian work, but it
must strengthen its capacity to deal effectively with the
problems we now face or risk sliding into irrelevance.
The Secretary-General himself recognized this
last year when he said that we have come to a fork in
the road, a moment no less decisive than in 1945 when
the United Nations was founded. And, again this year,
he stated that if the leaders of the world could not
agree on the way forward, history would take the
decisions. The issue he raises for us all is whether we,
the United Nations membership, can rise to the
challenge and take the steps necessary for the
Organization to fulfil its aims in today’s world.
Australia strongly supported last year the
establishment by the Secretary-General of a High-level
Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and we
stand ready to contribute to ambitious outcomes. I want
to return to the work of the Panel later in this address.
There would be few nations in the room
untouched by terrorism. As the cowardly attacks in
Beslan and at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta
illustrate, terrorism will not simply fade away. In
response, we, the international community, cannot
allow security threats to fester. What is required is new
thinking, practical action, and cooperation between
Governments. Obviously, the United Nations has a
primary role to play. But Governments and regional
organizations must also ensure that their resources and
infrastructure can respond to the current environment.
This is a responsibility Australia has taken very
seriously. On terrorism, we have fully supported the
work of the United Nations, ensuring Jema’ah
Islamiyah was listed as a terrorist organization under
the Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) sanctions
regime and promoting compliance with the United
Nations terrorist asset freezing regime.
We have committed energy and resources to
building counter-terrorism cooperation in our own
region, both bilaterally and through organizations such
as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the
Regional Forum of the Association of South-East
Asian Nations. We are also committed to building
understanding as part of a comprehensive approach.
This is evident in the messages we convey to our
regional partners and to Australians — namely, that our
efforts to stop a minority of extremist Muslim terrorists
is not a war on Islam; that Muslims are as much the
victims of terrorist attacks and must defend
themselves; and that we must all work to defeat
terrorism together.
Our cooperation with regional partners has
delivered results, but as the recent bombing in Jakarta
illustrates, terrorism in our own region is not yet
defeated. While Australia’s embassy in Jakarta may
have been the target of the latest attack, it was as much
an assault on Indonesia as on Australia, and we are
particularly saddened by the loss of innocent
Indonesian lives. Indonesia and Australia are
determined to catch the perpetrators and see justice
done, for the bonds between us cannot be split by
terrorists, but only strengthened.
Australia’s commitment to a stable and secure
region is particularly reflected in our efforts in the
Pacific. Since 11 September 2001, we have come to
appreciate more acutely the dangers weak and failing
States can pose to security. Of course, not all such
21

States are home to terrorists, but where instability and
vulnerabilities exist, so, too, do opportunities for crime
and the potential for human suffering.
When our Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer,
addressed this forum last year, he noted Australia was
developing regional approaches to confront the dangers
of State failure and that with our Pacific Islands Forum
partners we were restoring hope to the people of
Solomon Islands. In just one year, the Regional
Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands has made
excellent progress in restoring stability and law and
consolidating Government finances, and is now
moving into long-term governance reform.
Australia is also working with other States in our
region, notably Papua New Guinea and Nauru, to
address economic management and governance issues.
Regional cooperation is being strengthened through the
Pacific Plan, an initiative of the recent Pacific Islands
Forum meeting in Apia, which seeks to enhance
collaboration in areas of governance. I am delighted to
see among us today the Secretary-General of the
Pacific Islands Forum and welcome him to this Hall.
We would encourage the High-level Panel on
Threats, Challenges and Change to outline ambitious
proposals for effective collective action to address
failed and failing States, including more explicit
provision for action by regional and other plurilateral
arrangements, as set out in Chapter VIII of the Charter.
Iraq is at a critical moment in its political
evolution. A small minority is bent on destruction and
murder and wants to deny the Iraqi people their
opportunity to express their political will through
elections. This minority also attacks those who are
working to rebuild Iraq’s economy and improve Iraqi
lives. Increasingly, Iraqis themselves will be
responsible for doing that work, but success will
depend on the resolute support of the international
community.
We cannot allow terrorists to disrupt the
democratic process in Iraq. Prime Minister Alawi has
emphasized his Government’s determination to hold
elections in January 2005 and the Special
Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq has
told the Security Council that maintaining the election
schedule is his greatest priority. While the difficult
security conditions in Iraq cannot be denied, it is
imperative that the United Nations fulfil its role under
Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) and work with
Iraqis to complete arrangements for the elections on
time.
The size of the United Nations presence in Iraq
must be commensurate with the importance and
urgency of its task. For its part, Australia remains
committed to assisting Iraq transform itself. To this
end, we have committed more than $125 million, much
of it directed through United Nations agencies.
The situation in Darfur is a humanitarian disaster.
Australia is committed to supporting urgent
international efforts to end this horrific crisis. We have
already committed $20 million in emergency assistance
for the people of Darfur. We welcome the adoption of
Security Council resolution 1564 (2004) and applaud
the African Union for agreeing to lead a mission to
Darfur. Let me make this very clear: we stand ready to
offer assistance to this mission. The situation in Darfur
highlights the need for the international community to
develop a better framework for responding to
humanitarian crises, and we hope the High-level Panel
on Threats, Challenges and Change will come up with
clear and workable recommendations on humanitarian
intervention.
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs) is another urgent concern. Unless we act
firmly and with unity, terrorist groups could one day
acquire WMDs with disastrous consequences. As a
threat to international security, the issue of WMD
proliferation falls squarely within the Security
Council’s mandate. We welcome the adoption of
resolution 1540 (2004) as a demonstration of the
Council’s willingness to tackle WMD proliferation,
including the risk of WMD terrorism. We hope that
with the adoption of this resolution, the Council will
take a firmer and more active stance on WMD issues.
As part of our commitment to combating the risk
of nuclear terrorism, Australia will host an Asia-Pacific
ministerial conference in November on nuclear
safeguards and security. In addition, in the First
Committee this year, we, along with Turkey and
Argentina, will introduce a draft resolution on the
prevention of the illicit transfer and unauthorized
access to, and use of, man-portable air defence systems
(MANPADS). We hope for a consensus adoption of
this draft resolution, which encourages States to take
concrete steps to prevent MANPADS from falling into
the hands of non-State end-users.
22

Allow me to return to the subject of the High-
level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change. During
this address, I have referred several times to
it. Australia welcomes the direction of panel
discussions — as far as we understand them — with
respect to both doctrinal and institutional reform. We
have contributed actively to the Panel’s work and we
encourage the Panel, in its remaining deliberations, to
work towards ambitious recommendations on its entire
programme of work, including Security Council
reform, addressing threats from WMDs and terrorism,
humanitarian intervention and effective collective
action.
On the issue of structural reform, we note here
that Australia has advocated expanding the permanent
membership of the Security Council to make it more
compatible with geographical realities, through the
addition of Japan, India, Brazil, an African country and
Indonesia. Whatever the final shape of the Panel’s
report, one thing is clear: high-level political
commitment will be crucial to bringing bold reform
recommendations to fruition. We would encourage all
Member States to give the Secretary-General their full
support in considering the Panel’s recommendations.
One opportunity to do this will be the 2005
United Nations summit of heads of State or
Government. The summit provides an excellent forum,
not only to review implementation of the Millennium
Development Goals, but also to endorse a reformed
United Nations that is better equipped to deal with the
challenges it faces.
Australia has long advocated the need for United
Nations reform. Back in 2000 in this forum, the Prime
Minister warned that,
“In the absence of change and adaptation, the
Organization will wither as the nations of the
world bypass it in favour of ... mechanisms that
are more relevant to their needs” (A/55/PV.20,
p. 25).
Of course, this warning was before 11 September
2001, before coalition action in Afghanistan and Iraq
and before the terrorist bombings in Bali, Jakarta,
Madrid, Istanbul and many other locations. If the need for
reform was pressing then, it is critical now. The High-
level Panel provides the best prospect for repositioning
the United Nations system to meet contemporary
challenges. This is an opportunity we cannot waste if the
United Nations — our Organization — is to retain a
substantial role in maintaining international peace and
security in the twenty-first century."
4688,59,2004,VUT,"I bring to this
gathering a warm greeting from the people of the
Republic of Vanuatu.
Mr. President, at the outset, I take this
opportunity to congratulate you on your assumption of
the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-
ninth session. I also take this occasion to acknowledge
with deep gratitude the contributions of your
predecessor, who so competently steered the work of
the fifty-eighth session to its conclusion.
Here, I must also acknowledge the outstanding
role of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been
resolute in his efforts to revitalize the Organization’s
ability to address global concerns. My delegation
reaffirms its support for Mr. Annan’s profound and
meticulous leadership of the United Nations.
I also take this opportunity to convey the
condolences of my Government and the people of
Vanuatu to the people of the Caribbean nations, in
particular Haiti, for the loss of so many lives and for
the extensive damage caused by the destructive forces
of nature that recently swept through the region. We
offer them our moral support and pray that the affected
peoples will soon recover and that the devastated areas
of their nations will be swiftly rehabilitated and rebuilt.
Those inevitable natural calamities demonstrate once
more the extreme and particular vulnerability of island
States, which seriously affects national economies.
Every year, from this rostrum, we reaffirm our
faith and confidence in upholding the purposes and
principles of the Charter. We entered the new
millennium with much anticipation and hope of
creating a just and better world for all our citizens.
However, global insecurity and the varying dimensions
of serious conflict have created a frightening situation.
It is to be expected that the world will plunge into
further turmoil unless the role of the United Nations —
the only truly global body — is reinvigorated and
recovers its legitimate responsibility of addressing the
causes of conflict and maintaining peace and security. I
come to the Assembly with some trepidation, as I see
our world spiralling out of control unless its Members
uphold the universality of the United Nations decision-
making process in addressing global concerns.
The world is at a crossroads and we meet here at
a critical juncture. Around us, civil strife, wars,
poverty, disease, famine, drought, natural disasters,
terrorism, environmental degradation, depletion of land
and marine resources and other phenomena are
ravaging the world. The displacement of peoples from
their natural habitats and the sacrilege of human
suffering in many parts of the world demonstrate that
25

unless immediate remedial strategies are implemented,
the global situation will continue to deteriorate.
Moreover, the emergence of conflict in areas we
once believed stable, the deterioration of law and order
and the senseless killing of innocent peoples are
painful reminders that we need to rethink our policies
and decisions. Globalization has brought with it both
opportunities and challenges, but for the small island
States the challenges are much more ominous. Those
are the realities.
Those negative developments lead me to
conclude that the United Nations is indispensable and
that we all need to work as friends and equal partners.
Globalization has brought nations together. We are
interlinked and interdependent. That demands global
cooperation and governance from all responsible
Members of the Organization. Understandably, there
are the vested interests of the powerful, but that only
necessitates genuine cooperation and goodwill to
achieve convergence of those interests. The United
Nations role in that regard must remain fundamental in
order to ensure compatibility with the international
legal framework. Maverick policies and decisions will
only create further divisions and hostility.
With that in mind, I believe there is now
consensus on introducing far-reaching reforms that
make the United Nations relevant for all its Members,
with the fundamental objective of preserving
international peace, security and stability.
My Government fully supports efforts to reform
the United Nations system in order to ensure a stronger
and more effective Organization. On that note, my
delegation endorses the view of other delegations on
the need to review the membership of the Security
Council so that it will better reflect geographical
distribution and the underrepresented groups of
Member countries of the United Nations, without
affecting the authority of the Council.
I hope all the rhetoric that has come before the
Assembly can be translated into concrete and practical
action. We must be resolute in our collective desire to
work together as sovereign nations in addressing the
world’s problems through multilateral institutions. The
blueprint for international cooperation has been
established, but reforming certain structures in the
United Nations system must be seen as a prerequisite if
we are serious about moving forward. The Achilles
heel of the current structure is the imbalance of power
in the United Nations system. It has become so chronic
that it has weakened the multilateral focus,
cohesiveness and internationalism of the United
Nations.
The principles of democratization and good
governance so actively advocated and championed by
some Members must be reflected in the reorganization
and decision-making process of the United Nations
system.
It is in this regard that Vanuatu supports the
review of the permanent membership of the Security
Council in order to include Japan and one
representative each from the African continent, the
Middle East and the group of small developing
countries. A more representative Council will bring
about openness and transparency, create confidence
and ameliorate understanding and cooperation. A
restructuring of the membership of the Security
Council is long overdue. Diversity is essential there.
My Government looks forward to the report of
the Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Threats,
Challenges and Threats.
Although the fight against terrorism takes centre
stage, it must not overshadow the socio-economic
development agenda and other serious security
concerns affecting the developing world, and in
particular small island States. Resources will inevitably
be diverted towards combating terrorism in all its
facets, but judicious decisions need to be taken. It is
against that background that our delegation wishes to
associate itself with statements made by other
delegations on the imperativeness of supporting the
development constraints of developing nations, and in
particular the concerns of the small island States on
vulnerability.
At the Millennium Summit leaders adopted the
eight Millennium Development Goals, with targets to
be achieved by 2015. Although commitments have
been made, the lethargic performance of many
countries, including Vanuatu, demonstrate the need for
more international support in assisting countries to
meet those targets.
The global economic situation today
discriminates against many developing economies.
Unfair trading practices and the imposition of intrusive
policies on national economies — including that of
Vanuatu — affect those economies by opening them up
to unfavourable conditions that only favour stronger
nations. The post-Cancún period poses extreme
challenges to the economic survival and socio-
26

economic stability of many small developing nations
like Vanuatu.
My Government’s initial focus is on the social
sector, namely, on health and education. The
Government’s prioritized action agenda, which was
launched last year in consultation with our
development partners, is the catalyst for Vanuatu’s
medium- to long-term strategic planning. This
development policy framework is consistent with
achieving the targets of the Millennium Development
Goals and emphasizes the need to empower our rural
population through infrastructure- and capacity-
building initiatives. We appeal to our development
partners to adequately assist us in its implementation.
On that note, my delegation wishes to express its
gratitude to the United States of America for granting
Vanuatu eligibility to access development funding from
the Millennium Challenge Account.
The primary responsibility for development lies
with a State itself. Yet, external influences and
conditional aid have not adequately corresponded with
Vanuatu’s development priorities and achievements.
The pretext for meting out foreign advice conditioned
with development assistance has been to improve
governance and other sectors considered vital in
establishing a strong economy. In Vanuatu’s case that
line of argument has not produced tangible results,
with restricted progress being reflected in our
continuous struggle with reforms that are more or less
dictated by external forces.
Both the recipient and the external assistance
must be balanced and sensitive to national interests.
Too often, that normal reaction is misunderstood by
some of our development partners. From Vanuatu’s
perspective, externally driven reforms must be
buttressed by an equal partnership that respects local
tradition, culture and the rights of all citizens without
disturbing the essential uniting mechanisms of society
that have successfully held us together over time. An
exploitative agenda can only erode and dismantle those
ingrained mechanisms, leaving us vulnerable to the
rapid changes affecting all of us today. Vanuatu
embraces democracy and the concepts of governance
and transparency, but they must be tailored to suit the
traditional system without affecting the relevance and
significance of those far-reaching principles.
In recent times, the history of the Organization
has been characterized by indecision, which blemishes
the record of the United Nations. I speak about the
longstanding issue of self-determination, and in
particular the case of West Papua, and I do so while
being cognizant of the Charter and while espousing the
principles that continue to guide the Organization’s
efforts in the process of self-determination. The United
Nations must be consistent in its decisions for the
recognition and respect of the fundamental rights to
self-determination for the people of West Papua. The
truth surrounding the so-called Act of Free Choice
must be exposed to the Melanesian sisters and brothers
of West Papua and the rest of the international
community. Saddest of all is General Assembly
resolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969, concerning West
Papua. How can the United Nations continue to ignore
the cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?
As world leaders, we have time and again expressed
serious concerns and dissatisfaction about the fact that
certain decisions and actions by the United Nations or
its bodies were not consistent with the purposes and
intentions of the Charter. However, in the case of West
Papua, absolutely nothing has been done to rectify the
gross violation of internationally accepted practice. It
is therefore our joint responsibility to address this grey
area of history.
The continuing disputes and concerns raised with
regard to the legality of United Nations-endorsed
instruments that have been concluded throughout the
years — such as the New York Agreement of 1962, to
govern the United Nations administration of the so-
called Act of Free Choice in West Papua — is a clear
example challenging the integrity and validity of
United Nations resolutions at that time. In our opinion,
the United Nations-conducted exercises were a total
farce conditioned only to suit the geopolitical climate
of that period. The United Nations cannot, and must
not, continue to turn a blind eye to its own past
failures. It is morally, politically and legally wrong to
do so. The Netherlands in particular, which was the
former colonial authority, should also recognize that it
should shoulder some responsibility in helping to
resolve the unfortunate situation of West Papua in a
peaceful and transparent manner. Why is no one
accountable for those unjust decisions affecting the
lives of millions of people today?
Vanuatu therefore calls for the establishment of a
special commission of inquiry to review the United
Nations conduct in relation to the 1969 Act. We also
call for the United Nations to send a fact-finding
mission to examine the situation in West Papua with
regard to human rights abuses and other related issues.
And we call for the reinscription of West Papua on the
27

list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those are
critically challenging responsibilities.
On a final matter, my delegation strongly
reaffirms its support for resolution 2758 (XXVI),
which was adopted during the twenty-sixth session, in
1971, and which recognized the legal and political
representation of the People’s Republic of China as a
Member of the United Nations. Vanuatu again
reiterates its unwavering support for one China and
urges all members of the United Nations to work in the
interests of world peace and stability in the Asia-
Pacific region.
In conclusion, I must bring to the attention of the
Assembly another priority issue that is of grave
importance to my Government and nation. I would
once again like to raise the matter of the relocation of
the Pacific Operations Centre of the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
from Vanuatu to another location. My Government was
not properly consulted in that regard, and requests that
the decision to relocate the Centre from Vanuatu be
reconsidered. If the Centre’s relevance in the region is
being questioned, then my Government would propose
that a proper review be carried out with a view to
restructuring the ESCAP office in order to relocate the
Pacific Operations Centre to Bangkok. Programmes
and activities under ESCAP responsibility may be
better coordinated through the United Nations
Development Programme activities in the region.
I hope that wisdom will prevail as the debate
continues on our future destiny. Despite all our
differences and diversity, human security for all is our
main goal. That should remain the focus of the United
Nations agenda. The cardinal question is whether
Members will allow the United Nations to undertake
serious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead. The
future remains in our hands."
4736,35,1980,NZL,"﻿Sir, may I congratulate you on your election to the presidency. I know that, like your predecessor, Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania, you will carry out your responsibilities with firmness, courtesy and skill.
74.	As a Commonwealth member, New Zealand welcomes to the Assembly the delegations of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Zimbabwe. They bring, from different parts of the world, special perspectives which will help us all in considering the serious problems which face us.
75.	In welcoming these two new Members, we should not forget that other peoples are also moving rapidly towards independence. In our part of the world Vanuatu, in the most difficult circumstances, came to full nationhood. As a neighbour we were delighted to welcome the new Republic into the fellowship of the South Pacific Forum. We have watched with great sympathy the moves to greater autonomy by the island groups that make up the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. New Zealand's immediate partners, the people of Tokelau, are assuming increasing responsibility for the government of their tiny country.
76.	The South Pacific is coming to the end of a long period of constitutional change. Twenty years ago, when the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted , New Zealand and Australia were the only independent countries in our region. Now there are some 13 independent or fully self-governing States. Some are represented here. In the course of time more will come, and the voice of the Pacific will be heard more insistently.
77.	As the United Nations has grown, its ways of doing business, as well as the scope of its activities, have changed. To some it seems a less effective, less purposeful Organization than it was. I know that this body is itself a reflection of the world around us—and that has been troubled enough. And yet it is difficult not to be pessimistic when we assess what has been achieved over the past year.
78.	Only last month the General Assembly met in special session to discuss development and economic issues. The session was convened against a background of mounting concern about the world economy. Every speaker at that session talked of the gravity of the present situation. Every speaker called for rapid change. Every speaker supported the launching of a new round of global economic negotiations.
79.	This was not mere rhetoric. During the past month I have spoken to many political leaders, especially from Asian and Pacific countries. It was crystal clear that all of us shared an overriding preoccupation with economic issues. Time and again I heard the same themes: terms of trade have deteriorated rapidly; inflation, most of it imported, is far too high; deficits are expanding at an unprecedented rate. The conventional answer—retrenchment—exacts a high economic price in terms of contraction of trade and stagnation of production. The political cost, not least in jobs lost and social disruption, is prohibitive. To cover their share of the total oil deficit, countries in our area have had to borrow heavily. For many of them, debt servicing burdens are already crippling. High interest rates and a good deal of nervousness on the part of the private banking system compound the problems of financing economic development in the face of the growing deficit problem.
80.	It is not surprising that Governments of developing countries—and quite a few in the more affluent world—are apprehensive, for tensions produced by economic forces induce political reactions.
81.	Yet at the recent eleventh special session the Assembly failed even to agree on procedures for carrying out the global negotiations, let alone to discuss an agenda. I can well understand the scepticism of those who ask whether the Assembly, or a derivative of it, is the best place in which to discuss complex international economic issues. I tend to agree with them. However, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has shown that it is possible to resolve a wide and complicated range of such issues in a forum in which all Member States are represented. If we can draw some encouragement from that example, we should not forget how long the process has taken and how much had to be done outside the main meetings to develop a consensus about legitimate objectives and priorities. Above all, we should remember that the Conference on the Law of the Sea is succeeding because it organized its negotiations on the basis of actual situations and shared interests—not on the basis of political alignments and regional groupings. I must emphasize that we do not have a decade to make progress on the world's urgent economic problems. We now have less than one year.
82.	If we are to make similar progress on global economic issues, we must tackle them with new urgency. We shall have to accept that there is not going to be a revolutionary change of attitude on the part of the wealthy industrialized countries—whether of West or East. Progress will come gradually and probably most effectively by using the specialist bodies. A central forum may well—and should—give drive and coherence to those negotiations. However, let us not expect too much from it. It simply is not realistic to believe that some supranational forum can direct and determine the course of negotiations in bodies like IMF, GATT and FAO. It is for these specialized bodies to take the immediate steps that are so essential. Here again, progress has been much too slow.
83.	We could speed up the global negotiations more effectively if we were first to call together a more limited but broadly representative informal summit, as proposed by the Brandt Commission.  It may be that the outlines of a broad consensus on the way forward are more likely to emerge from such a meeting than from a gathering of 150 or more. That was the view of the regional Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries, which I attended last month, at New Delhi. The Meeting of Finance Ministers of Commonwealth Countries in Bermuda was even more convinced of the need for action.
84.	What we discuss is at least as important as where we discuss it. It has concerned me that recent discussions in New York have become bogged down in proposals for an agenda which is all-encompassing and unselective. The consensus of the heads of Government and Finance Ministers I have listened to in the past month is that the international oil situation and its flow-on problems, especially in financing, is the major issue to be faced if the longer-term difficulties in the world economy and in the North-South dialogue are to be dealt with adequately.
85.	I do not want to be misunderstood by oil producers when I say that the central issue is to solve the problem of international balances of payments, particularly of developing countries. That means we must find an effective means of recycling the surpluses of the oil producers. I do not deny that oil was under-priced in the past. Nor am I suggesting that the large increase in oil prices since 1973 is the sole cause of the world's present economic woes. I am simply saying that this is a major and immediate problem which requires international action—now.
86.	Look at these facts. The forecast is that the combined deficit of developing countries over the next three years will be about $US 160 billion. There are only two possible ways of covering those deficits: one is through grant aid; the second is through borrowing, whether at commercial or concessional rates. Grant aid is not going to cover deficits of that size, even in the unlikely event that official development assistance performance improves dramatically. Whether the private banking system can cope is equally open to question. The previous round of recycling subjected it to considerable stress. In my view, greater involvement by international financial institutions and greater flexibility in their approach are now a necessity if global payments imbalances are not to widen, with grave economic consequences for us all.
87.	Institutions, no less than Governments, have to adapt to new circumstances. If they show no capacity to adjust, the pressures to set up new bodies to replace them will become irresistible. That is why at recent meetings New Zealand supported calls for IMF to play a much more positive and dynamic role in the recycling process in support of the private banking system. I am convinced that IMF has the skills and expertise which will enable it to respond to the needs of the world today.
88.	I believe that the decisions taken at the annual World Bank and IMF meetings last week in Washington bring those institutions closer to grappling with the recycling problem. New Zealand has continued to advocate the concept of symmetrical surveillance, so that the capacity of surplus countries and the needs of deficit countries can be matched. The adjustment burden is a problem for the international community operating through its public as well as its private institutions. The surplus nations must realize the serious difficulties which confront the oil-importing nations of the developing world. They must—and, I believe, will- acknowledge that their economic power can be used through increased commitments and guarantees for IMF in order to avert a series of national bankruptcies.
89.	The international community has the power and ingenuity to act quickly on critical economic issues. It must do so. If we are to bring new urgency and purpose to the economic negotiations of the Organization, then we have to ask ourselves whether a more functional negotiating format is called for. Does the group approach to negotiations still serve us well? On the evidence of those major United Nations economic conferences held during the past two years, I would have to say that I doubt it. The Brandt Commission reached a similar conclusion. Its report says:
'The process of reconciling differences within each group has often led to extreme positions driving out moderate ones: maximum demands elicit minimum offers.' 
90.	But that is only one of the weaknesses of our present system. Another is that the specific interests of individual countries, or groups of countries, are often subordinated to the cause of group solidarity.
91.	The small island communities in the South Pacific are a case in point. Their economies are small and their resources limited. Dependent on a narrow range of exploitable commodities, highly sensitive to price fluctuations, handicapped by high transport costs and uncertain services to their main export markets, they are especially vulnerable to external influences which they cannot control. The fragility of their economies is increased by their isolation from each other and from neighbouring regions. No other factor so persistently hampers Pacific countries in the struggle to develop their resources and provide better lives for their people.
92.	Clearly, the island States of the Pacific have special needs, and the international community must be responsive to those needs. It is not just that they require development assistance, though that is essential. It is also a question of providing the mechanism by which small countries can express their concerns and get them dealt with effectively.
93.	It is not enough in the long run to label developing island countries as a separate category meriting special treatment. I believe that what those countries want, and what other countries in the so-called special categories want, too, is to take their place in the mainstream of international life. They do not want to be set apart for ever as societies which do not fit into some preconceived pattern. Regrettably, the international community seems to have settled for this option in drawing up an international development strategy for the 1980s.
94.	We in New Zealand have also suffered from the rigidities imposed by bloc diplomacy. Our specific economic circumstances and interests are obscured when the membership of the Organization is divided by shorthand expressions like 'North' and 'South', or labelled by groups.
95.	For years the world community has ignored the questions of food production and market access which are central to New Zealand's economic well-being. The group system of negotiation has effectively blocked our efforts to have these issues given greater priority. Now, it seems, they are beginning to receive due attention. There is a new awareness that it is all too easy to undermine the confidence of rural communities. No one knows this better than the developing countries which, during the past decade, have changed from being exporters to importers of food. More and more countries are coming to see that the double standards governing the international food trade have got to go. Unless that happens it will be an uphill battle to restore and sustain the confidence of farmers, and they are the people we look to if we are to feed the hungry of this world.
96.	In the struggle to overcome agricultural protectionism in the industrialized world, New Zealand's interests are essentially the same as those of the developing countries. With them, and with many others, we also have an interest in bringing about a more liberal trading system in all sectors. In the global negotiations, in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, in UNCTAD, in GATT we shall work to that end with all who want a fairer trading system. If we achieve that, we may then see that expansion of world economic growth rates which is an essential ingredient of political stability and security.
97.	In your opening address, Mr. President, you reminded us that the vision of the men who established the Organization was one of a world at peace. You rightly said that that could be achieved only if the United Nations was determined to apply those principles for which it stands: to promote the self-determination of all peoples; to protect the sovereign equality of nations, especially the weak and the small; to promote human rights and freedom,
98.	It is chastening to think how far we have to go before we can say we have reached those goals which, by our membership, we have all set ourselves. That is all too clear from the political as well as the economic tensions that rock the world today. The principles that the Organization was established to defend have been persistently defied.
99.	Afghanistan is one crisis area that calls out for a speedy and just solution. Earlier this year New Zealand joined more than 100 Member States in supporting resolution ES-6/2 in which the Assembly deplored the armed intervention in that country. Immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of all foreign troops was called for. That resolution was ignored. Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan. They are there because the regime they installed cannot survive without them. The people of Afghanistan have, by their resistance, shown their rejection of that regime and the alien forces which continue to prop it up.
100.	The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan violated the basic principles of the Charter. It threatened the security of neighbouring States. It increased tension in West Asia and the Indian Ocean region, and it has thrown into disarray the process, of detente to which the Soviet Union has so often pledged its commitment.
101.	There is only one sure way to reverse that dangerous situation and that is for the Soviet Union to display that respect for the principles of international behaviour which it champions so earnestly when the actions of others are concerned. It must withdraw its troops. It must allow the Afghan people to decide their own future freely and without interference.
102.	That assault on the sovereignty of a small neighbouring State has its parallel in South-East Asia. There a client Government has been imposed on the people of Kampuchea and maintained by force of arms. The situation in Kampuchea has implications for peace, stability and progress in the whole of South-East Asia.
103.	At the thirty-fourth session, the Assembly called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea. That call was disregarded. Those forces are still there and they are involved in fighting along the Thai-Kampuchean border and elsewhere. It is a matter of grave concern to New Zealand that there has been so little improvement in the situation since the Assembly last met in regular session. The longer the fighting goes on, the greater is the risk that the conflict could spread. Until there is a political settlement, there can be no regional stability and no sure end to the hardships of those ordinary people for too long caught up in a conflict in which they want no part.
104.	Relief efforts will be needed for a long time to come. It is essential that the relief operation should be able, without hindrance, to distribute supplies to those in greatest need, wherever they are. It is no less important that Kampuchea's agricultural production should be restored. Its economy must be revitalized so that the victims of the conflict can return to their homes and to a normal way of life.
105.	I know that the countries of South-East Asia want peace and stability. They want to pursue their economic development free from threats to their security. The Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] countries, with broad support from the international community, have consistently sought a durable political settlement. The resolution adopted last year set out the principles that must form the basis for a settlement.
106.	The Assembly needs to give stronger support to the search for a settlement. New Zealand welcomed the visit of the Secretary-General to Bangkok and Hanoi. Clearly, he can play a major role. We, like others, look to him to help get productive talks under way between Viet Nam and its ASEAN neighbours and to facilitate the holding of an international conference which is needed to reduce tension and achieve a just and lasting settlement.
107.	Another area in Asia which is subject to severe strains is the Korean peninsula. New Zealand will continue to support measures aimed at reducing tension in that area. We have been encouraged by the recent series of preliminary meetings between representatives from North and South Korea which have had as their objective the development of north-south contacts. We urge both sides to maintain the momentum of those meetings and to continue in good faith the search for a peaceful and lasting accommodation.
108.	The conflict between Iraq and Iran is also a matter of great concern to us. It has caused loss of life and damage in both countries and could, if fighting continues, have serious consequences within the region and beyond. We are anxious that the fighting should be halted so that the differences between the two countries can be resolved peaceably and soon. We support the appeal made by the Security Council to that end in its resolution 479 (1980) and welcome the efforts being made by others to bring about a peaceful settlement.
109.	It is no less urgent that a settlement should be negotiated in the Middle East. That dispute is a continuing threat to world peace and security. The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel  was a conspicuous step forward, but it was only a beginning. The hopes that it would lead to a comprehensive and durable peace based on the principles embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) have not been realized. They will not be until Israel acknowledges the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. Those include the right to self-determination and the right to establish a separate State, if that is their wish. Equally, the unilateral declaration on Jerusalem and the continued establishment of settlements in occupied territories can hardly be construed as anything but obstructions to a negotiated settlement.
110.	The continuing detention of people from the American Embassy in Teheran is another grave cause of tension. New Zealand's position is clear. We deplore Iran's refusal to release the hostages. A speedy and honourable solution must be found—first for the sake of the people concerned, but also if we are to respect the principles of international law. We are certainly willing to join others in efforts to get a peaceful solution.
111.	A year ago New Zealand welcomed two major advances in the search for a peaceful settlement of the conflicts in southern Africa: the London conference on Zimbabwe and the resumption of negotiations on Namibia.
112.	Zimbabwe's presence here today is testimony to the determination of its people and of all those who have worked so hard for a just and equitable settlement. It is a particular pleasure to me that the Commonwealth was able to play a formative part in the peaceful transfer of power in that country.
113.	A similar transfer of power must also be the objective in Namibia. There is no good reason why the few issues that remain outstanding should not be settled quickly. It has long been time for the South African authorities to end their illegal occupation of Namibia. They must, if they want a peaceful settlement, co-operate with the Security Council in bringing independence to the people of Namibia. Just as in 1980 we welcomed the independence of Zimbabwe so in 1981	we should welcome that of Namibia.
114.	If there is to be lasting stability, however, the South African Government must move ahead with the dismantling of the apartheid system in South Africa itself. If there are signs that the present rulers of South Africa are beginning to understand the need for change, there is less evidence of serious commitment to this course. They must now demonstrate clearly and unequivocally by their actions and policies that institutionalized racism and the injustices and suffering that apartheid has inflicted on generations of Africans are being brought to an end. There is no other way to a peaceful future. The alternative, a vicious and bloody conflict, must be avoided. It can be, but only if the South African Government will promptly set about overturning the detestable system of apartheid.
115.	Increased tension in many parts of the world and, above all, the invasion of Afghanistan have had grave consequences for relations between the great Powers. Detente is in jeopardy.
116.	Nowhere has that been more clear than in negotiations on arms control and disarmament. Here the central need is for confidence that obligations assumed will be fully met, so it is no surprise that there has been no real forward movement. The SALT II Treaty remains un-ratified. The Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces, Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe are stalemated. The sessions of the Committee on Disarmament have, by and large, been unproductive. The second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ended without agreement on a final declaration. Many countries, my own among them, rightly criticized the two super-Powers for lack of progress in their negotiations on arms control and disarmament.
117.	There is nothing in the relationship of those superpowers to suggest that we can expect quick progress on those arms control and disarmament issues which are essentially bilateral in nature. But that should not mean that movement must be held back in other areas. A fresh impetus is needed to get negotiations under way again.
118.	One such issue is a comprehensive test-ban treaty. No disarmament measure is more urgent. No one disputes the need for a treaty. The report presented to the Committee on Disarmament at the end of the latest round of bilateral talks showed that the negotiating States had made limited progress on many elements of critical importance. In our view, it is essential that a draft comprehensive test-ban treaty should be ready for consideration at the second special session on disarmament, in 1982. We believe, too, that a working group of the Committee on Disarmament should be established next year to begin negotiations on a treaty. One of its first tasks should be to devise a framework within which an international seismic detection system could operate to monitor adherence to the treaty.
119.	Many of these issues will continue to haunt the inter-national community throughout the i980s. There are others. What progress will we make in dealing humanely with the mass movement of displaced persons across borders? Will we be able to say, when it ends, that the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination has achieved its goals? The United Nations Decade for Women is already at mid-course. Will we be able to say in five years’ time that the lot of half the world's population has been greatly improved, when we know from the evidence given to the World Conference at Copenhagen in July, that the impact of the first five years has been so limited?
120.	The same question—whether achievement will match objectives—can be asked of many items on the Assembly's agenda. The answers, I believe, depend in large degree on whether we are willing to use the Organization sensibly, to seek genuine agreement to negotiate rather than declaim. Above all, it depends on whether we are able to break away from old rigidities and preconceptions and seek new ways of working together, ways which are imaginative and realist? That is the way for the world body, and for all of us, to face the challenges of this decade.
"
4797,35,1980,AUS,"﻿Mr. President, on behalf of the Australian delegation, I should like to add my very warm congratulations to those already expressed on your election as President of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that you will serve the Assembly with distinction and I offer you the fullest cooperation of my delegation.
146.	I wish also to express my Government's recognition of the continuing contribution made to the United Nations by Ambassador Salim, who brought to the office of President great diplomatic skill and wise counsel.
147.	Since the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly, Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have joined the United Nations. I should like to extend a very warm welcome to these fellow members of the Commonwealth, with whom we look forward to working closely in the common tasks that lie ahead.
148.	I do not believe that there is anyone here—indeed I do not believe that there is an informed person anywhere— who would contest the fact that the international situation has deteriorated seriously since we met here a year ago. While there are differences as to causes, motivations and responsibilities, the sense that we have entered a new and dangerous period is almost universal. So far, this period lacks a label, lacks a name. That, I believe, is no accident. We can be sure that it is not due to any lack of effort on the part of journalists, academics and speech writers. What stands out as we contemplate the current scene is its great complexity, and complexity resists labels.
149.	The absence of a label, the fact that we are confronting a crisis without a name, is indicative of a deeper problem: the absence of any agreed conceptual map of the historical territory into which we are advancing. The problem is not that there is no map, but rather that there are many different ones. Some have pulled down from the shelf, either reluctantly or enthusiastically, the old cold war map of the 1950s. Some cling with diminishing hope to the detente map of the 1970s. Third world spokesmen are understandably reluctant to surrender the North South map they have drawn in recent decades.'
150.	The reality is that none of these maps is adequate, but that all are relevant. For we are confronting a multidimensional crisis in which what have hitherto been semi-autonomous issues or areas of international politics are being drawn closely together and superimposed on each other. We have spoken much of interdependence in this forum over the last decade. It has now become increasingly evident that interdependence applies not only to countries but to issues and to realms of activity.
151.	I believe that perhaps the most serious danger we face at present is that, confronted with what is simultaneously unfamiliar, turbulent and dangerous, a sense of unmanageability may come to prevail. This in turn could lead to the embracing of simplistic solutions, in a despairing search for order and certainty, or to a fatalistic resignation. Either course would be disastrous. We are going to need to maintain as never before a sense of historical perspective and of political proportion.
152.	Thirty-five years ago, the peoples of the United Nations expressed their determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. To a remarkable extent we succeeded—to the extent, that is, that in a period of intense and bitter great Power rivalry, a rivalry which in terms of all historical precedents should have resulted in armed conflict, a third world war was averted. In a period of pessimism, that is worth remembering and weighing in the balance.
153.	That having been said, however, it must be recognized that the fact that we have avoided conflagration on a global scale is no consolation to the ravaged peoples of Indochina, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East or other lands. The ideals and objectives of the Organization have been brutally assaulted by the actions of certain of its Members. Now, no less than in 1945, the international community is faced with the tragic plight of millions of people—killed, maimed or rendered homeless and hungry by the scourge of war. Where we should be devoting a major part of our collective energy to meeting the developmental needs of the poorer countries and communities of this world, we find that energy divided and diminished by interstate and intergroup ambitions and rivalries which do nothing for mankind other than to add to its burden of misery and deprivation, a burden borne mostly by the poorest and most disadvantaged.
154.	The first Articles of the Charter affirm that all Members shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.
155.	What, however, is, for example, the situation in IndoChina, a region of particular concern to Australia? There is growing great Power rivalry; 200,000 occupation troops remain in Kampuchea; and there is the consequent lack of any opportunity for the Kampuchean people to choose their own Government. In addition, there are threats to the security of Thailand, made manifest by the incursion of Vietnamese troops into Thailand earlier this year. Those are the causes of regional political instability and tension. They are also the causes of human suffering on a scale which is affecting the life of the whole region.
156.	Australian policy in this situation is based on the resolution adopted last year, in which the Assembly called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea and for an act of self-determination by the Khmer people. Our support for those principles remains as strong as ever. A peaceful and secure Southeast Asia cannot be achieved until a political settlement has been reached in Kampuchea which is acceptable to all parties concerned and which gives full opportunity to the Kampuchean people to determine their own style of government and way of life. We accept that Viet Nam has legitimate interests to safeguard in regard to Kampuchea. What we cannot accept is that Viet Nam and its allies should be able to go on ref using to discuss seriously the fundamental questions of the occupation of Kampuchea by foreign forces and the legitimacy of the regime in Phnom Penh. Acceptable resolution of those issues is essential to the eventual achievement of a sovereign and independent Kampuchean nation as part of a secure environment for all Southeast Asian countries.
157.	Australia has participated actively in the international efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Kampuchean people, both within Kampuchea itself and in refugee camps in Thailand. Australian contributions, both governmental and private, to international humanitarian relief programmes to date exceed $A 24 million. Those international efforts have been necessary not only to meet the desperate and immediate needs of the Kampuchean people but to provide the basis for their eventual self-sufficiency. The achievements of the programme sponsored by the United Nations have been significant. Both common humanity and the peace and stability of the region demand that the effort be sustained until a lasting solution is found.
158.	IndoChina is not the only point of danger. The activities of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and elsewhere have inevitably impaired the international climate of trust necessary for the negotiation of effective arms control measures. That is particularly true with respect to the preparations for the Conference, to be held in Sri Lanka, on the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We must consider the proximity of Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean, as well as the general climate of apprehension and uneasiness among the littoral and hinterland States of the region which Soviet activity has brought about. The massive military build-up and deployment in the region of the Indian Ocean has cast an ominous shadow over efforts to bring about peace in that region and consequently over preparations for a conference aimed at the creation of a zone of peace.
159.	It is difficult to envisage how we could expect a conference to produce a declaration on a zone of peace when one of the hinterland States of the region is forcibly occupied by one of the Powers which would attend the conference. It is, however, precisely during periods of international tension that we must redouble our collective efforts to work out effective arms control measures.
160.	With that in mind, Australia is working actively with the other members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to work out arrangements for the eventual holding of a conference which would make a positive contribution to the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.
161.	Across the Indian Ocean from Australia, the problems of southern Africa continue to preoccupy the United Nations and the international community. The peaceful accession of Zimbabwe to independence and membership in the United Nations contrasts starkly with the continuing bleak situation in Namibia and South Africa. As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, Australia has been closely involved in United Nations attempts to resolve the problems posed by South Africa's illegal administration of the Territory. The Australian Government supports fully the process of negotiation currently under way aimed at bringing Namibia to independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It is a matter for regret, however, that two years have elapsed since passage of that resolution. A number of basic issues still remain to be resolved. Further delay can only fuel the frustration of the inhabitants of Namibia and of the members of the international community who are committed to a peaceful resolution of that problem.
162.	Just as my Government deplores the failure of the South African authorities so far to make possible the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia, so do we deplore the apartheid policies of the South African Government. We have heard the qualified promises from South African leaders that they will consider reforms. With that in mind, Australia calls on South Africa to adopt substantial and early measures to dismantle the repressive apartheid system and to redress the injustices which so many of its citizens suffer. The longer those processes are postponed, the more difficult it will become to bridge the deep divisions which characterize South African society, and the more likely it is that the political violence which has become an increasingly common feature of life in South Africa will escalate to the detriment of all the peoples there.
163.	One area of tension in which there has been some positive movement is that of Cyprus. Australia welcomes the resumption on 9 August of the intercommunal talks on Cyprus sponsored by the United Nations and sincerely hopes that the new round of negotiations will lead steadily towards a comprehensive solution.
164.	In this context, I recall that at the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government, held at Lusaka in August 1979, it was decided to ask the Commonwealth Secretary General to convene the Commonwealth Committee on Cyprus at the ministerial level whenever appropriate. While we believe that the intercommunal talks offer the best avenue for an enduring settlement in Cyprus, depending on the progress made at those talks, there may well be a need for the Commonwealth aspect to be further explored.
165.	Moving across the Mediterranean we find, regretfully, that the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate. Indeed, since I last spoke to the Assembly conditions there have clearly come to pose a grave threat to international peace.
166.	The Australian Government will support any well founded steps which bring hope of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. Any solution must clearly incorporate the principles embodied in Security Council resolution 242 (1967), together with recognition of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people.
167.	The Australian Government welcomes the contribution that the process begun at Camp David has made towards such a peace. Implementation of the bilateral aspects of that process has been one of the few positive developments in that troubled region, but, unfortunately, in other areas progress has been minimal. Neither the fundamental principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) nor recognition of the need to ensure a just future for the Palestinian people have been advanced.
168.	The Australian Government has been concerned about the inflammatory statements and actions of parties on both sides of the dispute which unhappily have exacerbated the already tense situation in the region. The unilateral declaration by the Israeli parliament that Jerusalem was the undivided capital of Israel has hindered the prospects for a lasting settlement. On the other hand, publicly stated rejections of Israel's right to exist undermine efforts to promote the development of an atmosphere in which genuine negotiations could take place.
169.	Given the growing and understandable sense of frustration over this lack of progress, it is most necessary that ways of moving forward again to meaningful negotiations be actively explored. The Australian Government has noted the declaration on the Middle East by the European Community heads of Government following their meeting at Venice in June of this year, and it hopes that the consultations flowing from this declaration will contribute, along with the Camp David process, to the search for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.
170.	I could not conclude my comments on the Middle East without expressing my Government's apprehension about the threat to global peace posed by some aspects of the present situation in Iran. Iran has an important role to play in promoting stability in the Middle East region. But it is clear that this role cannot be realized while the Iranian authorities continue to flout international convention and international law by holding diplomatic hostages. The Australian Government renews the call it has made many times in the long months since the United States diplomats were seized for the quick and safe release of all the hostages being held by the Iranian Government.
171.	I began my statement by referring to the deteriorating international situation. The events of the last few days remind us most forcibly of the dangers we face. The fighting which has erupted between Iraq and Iran is a further cause for very grave concern. That fighting continues to escalate. It has created a situation fraught with danger. It could have serious and unpredictable consequences for a highly sensitive region of the world. The problems between Iran and Iraq are, of course, complex and of long standing. Settlement will not be helped if outside parties seek to meddle in the dispute for their own advantage. Already there is serious concern that the conflict could tempt others into dangerous diplomatic and even military ventures.
172.	Australia joins others in urging Iran and Iraq to terminate their conflict. We welcome the initiative of the secretary General and the President of the Security Council in appealing for restraint and urging that Iraq and Iran negotiate a solution to their differences. Unless there is a prompt response to these appeals, we believe the Security Council should meet as a matter of urgency to consider the crisis.
173.	Among the distressing consequences of these and other conflicts is the appalling increase in the number of refugees around the world. In the past year, we have witnessed the continuing tragedy of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children being forced to flee their homes in fear of their lives and liberty and to seek sanctuary elsewhere. While substantial efforts have been made to find solutions to the problems of refugees, their numbers in almost every area of the world have continued to grow. Africa is faced with mass movements of people fleeing persecution, war and famine. Nearly 1 million people have fled from Afghanistan into Pakistan. There has been a massive influx of Kampucheans into Thailand and a continuing, steady stream of so-called boat people.
174.	The problem is rendered the more tragic by the fact that today the largest numbers of refugees are concentrated in the developing regions of the world, those with least resources, available to cope with such a burden. Africa has suffered particularly badly in this respect, with over 2 million refugees and displaced persons in the Horn of Africa alone. In Southeast Asia, the burden of the IndoChinese refugee crisis has fallen particularly heavily on the countries of ASEAN, imposing great financial, social and political costs.
175.	Solutions to the refugee problem can be found only with the cooperation and involvement of the world community, and it is encouraging to see the increasing attention which refugee questions are receiving in international forums. In the coming months the world will have to focus greater attention on Africa, which now has more refugees than any other part of the world. It is in recognition of this crisis that Australia has fully supported recent initiatives for the calling of a pledging conference on African refugees.
176.	Australia supports the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in his efforts to alleviate the distress and to promote the resettlement of dispossessed peoples around the world. We are proud of our own role as a country of resettlement for refugees. Since the Second World War, some 400,000 refugees and displaced persons have found new homes in Australia. In addition to resettling refugees, we have been active in providing financial aid. We have contributed more than $30 million in relief assistance for refugees and displaced persons in the past two years alone.
177.	However, we all know that the provision of humanitarian assistance is not of itself sufficient to deal with refugee problems. Long-term solutions will be found only if the underlying political causes of refugee situations are addressed. It is the duty of the world community to persuade those Governments concerned to accept their responsibilities towards their citizens and to change the policies which have led to massive refugee outflows.
178.	I turn to economic issues, for the eleventh special session on development is still fresh in all our minds. At that time, I addressed in detail the major economic questions confronting the international community, and I do not intend to retrace the ground that was covered there. A word is in order, however, with regard to the final outcome of the special session. Its failure to achieve agreement on the conditions for launching the global round was certainly disappointing. The urgency and the severity of the problems of the current international economic situation require a fresh approach to the task of international economic negotiation..
179.	The failure of the special session to reach agreement on procedures for global negotiations can be of satisfaction to no one. At this session of the General Assembly we must all reassess how best we might seek to go about the global round. Substantive differences remain and must be addressed. The way in which we approach these differences should, however, reflect flexibility on all sides. If this spirit is shared by all, success will be assured.
180.	Failure to launch the global round should not obscure the fact that the special session was productive of some valuable results. We now have an International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. It is a matter for satisfaction that the world community was able to agree upon a framework within which we might all approach the development needs of our time. We believe that the text agreed on in the special session should now be adopted and its implementation not be delayed.
181.	A special tribute should be paid to the important contribution of the Brandt Commission to international thinking about development issues. The Commission was the result of a unique initiative and its members are to be commended for their efforts to identify areas in which the North South dialogue might be constructively pursued and for the stress laid on interdependence and the commonality of interest of North and South. Australia sees the report of the Commission as both significant and timely and is interested in doing what it can to give effect to the general approach taken in the report.
182.	I turn now to nuclear and arms control and disarmament issues. The difficulties which confront the world in assuring itself of adequate energy sources highlight the importance of nuclear energy. We have seen an encouraging level of international debate on peaceful nuclear questions over the past year, such as the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, which should encourage the development over time of closer international comity on the arrangements and conditions governing nuclear trade and cooperation and sensitive stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. This trend was also observed at the recent Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons where, despite the lack of agreement on a consensus final document, there was substantial agreement on most issues relating to the application of international safeguards and the arrangements covering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
183.	The further development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes on a stable and secure basis depends, of course, on continuing efforts and constraints against the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. The relationship between the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and arms control and disarmament is integral to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a Treaty which represents a political barrier to nuclear weapon proliferation, both horizontally to new States and vertically to existing nuclear arsenals. It was significant that at the Second Review Conference, while the Treaty was subjected to rigorous examination, there was no questioning of its principal objectives. The absence of a final consensus statement reflected concern over the pace and direction of nuclear disarmament efforts rather than any fundamental conflict of interest. But a note of warning has been sounded that there must be balanced implementation of all the Treaty's major provisions if its effectiveness is to be maintained in the longer term.
184.	It is incumbent on the international community to make continuing efforts to encourage adherence to the Treaty and to offer incentives for doing so as well as disabilities for non- membership.
185.	That is not to deny the necessity of further measures of nuclear arms control by the nuclear weapons States. Australia has given strong support to the SALT process; which resulted in the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, and trusts that it will be continued. We have also been an active proponent of the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban agreement as a further restraint on the existing nuclear arsenals and a further major obstacle to the spread of nuclear weapons. The finalization of such a treaty is urgent, for the involvement of the international community through the Committee on Disarmament—to complement the efforts of the negotiating Powers—is essential if the treaty is to attract widespread support. Without that support its impact would be seriously limited.
186.	Events earlier this year have had an undesirably adverse effect on the degree of mutual trust and confidence necessary in bilateral and multilateral arms control negotiations. It is my country's hope that an atmosphere more conducive to negotiations can be restored.
187.	It is encouraging that the Committee on Disarmament has this year got down to serious business and has succeeded in separating polemical debate from the practical consideration of substantive issues. The Committee has been able in working groups to concentrate on the negotiating tasks for which it has a mandate.
188.	I now turn to decolonization and the South Pacific. As others before me have noted, 1980 is the twentieth anniversary of two landmark resolutions on decolonization adopted by this Assembly, resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV). With one lamentable exception, all African States which were once colonies have achieved their independence, and we have seen considerable progress in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.
189.	The most recent country to achieve its independence is the former condominium of the New Hebrides, the new State of Vanuatu. Australia has made known in committees of this Assembly its views on the achievement of independence by the State of Vanuatu. It is sufficient for me to say here that Australia welcomes the advent of the new State and looks forward to its becoming the newest Member of this Organization, should it decide to join the ranks. The events which followed Vanuatu's achievement of independence, specifically on Tanna and Santo islands, have drawn attention to the fact that the exercise of the right of self-determination in the South Pacific had previously been remarkably smooth and peaceful. It is Australia's hope that this predominant feature will continue to characterize the region as further transitions occur.
190.	There is one subject on the international agenda which has progressed most positively. I refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The resumed ninth session, which recently concluded at Geneva, has achieved significant results, reflected in the fact that the Conference now has the text of a draft convention before it. Australia was particularly pleased with the progress made. It is our hope that the package which has been negotiated will hold together and that a convention can be opened for signature in 1981. We shall be making every effort to help to achieve that goal.
191.	The Charter reaffirms our faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in equal rights of all men and women. Unhappily, it is all too easy to enumerate situations arising since the original signature of the Charter in 1945 and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 in which the sanctity of human life and the protection of human rights have been disregarded. The features of the current international scene that I have referred to earlier make it clear that there are formidable obstacles to progress. Human beings in many parts of the world continue to suffer the denial of their fundamental rights through political oppression, racism and foreign domination, as well as through poverty or lack of effective access to the organs of State which determine their lives.
192.	From an historical perspective, however, much has been done to bring hope to the dispossessed and deprived peoples of the world. Expectations have changed. Our definitions of deprivation have become more pragmatic, and today when we take account of the rights of individuals we include the rights of women, the disabled and the elderly. And we are beginning to talk of the right to development as a human right.
193.	So long as we live in a world of sovereign States, there will always be some tension between the legitimate interests of the States and the rights of individuals. But while accepting that, we should always scrutinize very carefully any attempted justification of the dilution of rights in terms of reasons of State. It should be made absolutely clear that the onus of proof lies with the Government in question. The flagrant violations of human rights, for whatever reason, are a proper concern of the international community, and cessation of the conditions of such violations can rightfully be demanded of responsible Governments. Australia is firmly committed to international action to ensure the protection of human rights, and we shall continue to attach the highest priority to the full realization of that fundamental goal as pursued both specifically in United Nations human rights programmes and more broadly in the activities of the Organization as a whole.
194.	I began my statement with some observations about the seriousness of the multiple crises which the world is now facing and by recalling some of the ideas which are basic to the Charter. There are some who will assume that, if we are moving into an era of great turbulence and danger, the Organization must automatically become more important than ever. There are others who will assume the exact opposite that as tensions increase and conflicts sharpen the United Nations will inevitably be shouldered aside and become of diminished relevance.
195. Both, in my view, are mistaken. Nothing is automatic, nothing is inevitable. The role which the United Nations will play in this critical period is not predetermined. It will depend on the will and capacity which we, its Members, bring to bear to make it effective and to make it relevant.
196. We should recognize the limitations of what the United Nations can do. But, having recognized them, we should ensure that the United Nations is used to these very limits. The United Nations cannot abolish power politics; it cannot end the conflicts and rivalries among some sovereign States. But it can bring pressure to bear to maintain dialogue and communications between conflicting parties, and it can contribute thereby to the process of peaceful settlement of international disputes. The United Nations is also best placed to articulate and organize the humanitarian impulses within the international community and to express the aspirations of mankind to peace and international cooperation. It can likewise bring moral censure to bear on those who ignore and isolate these impulses and aspirations. We have a duty to see that it does all these things, does them with conviction and does them with telling effect. 


"
4825,35,1980,PNG,"﻿I join the previous speakers in extending congratulations to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation, on your unanimous election to the post of President of this session of the General Assembly. We are confident that, with your excellent record and vast experience, you will be able to provide the leadership, guidance and direction essential to the success of this session.
44.	I also extend my delegation's congratulations and appreciation to your predecessor, Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania, for the efficient manner in which he presided over the proceedings of the previous session.
45.	This year two new States have been admitted to the international family of nations, namely, Zimbabwe and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My delegation is pleased to welcome them into this family. We look forward to developing close and cooperative relations with them. We also welcome them as members of the Commonwealth of nations, of which Papua New Guinea is a member.
46.	My Government is pleased to note that the new nation of Zimbabwe has embarked on its own road to destiny. Our experience has been that the early days of independence are as difficult as they are exciting. My delegation is pleased to note that the Government of Zimbabwe has, eagerly and efficiently, addressed itself to the task of providing a strong, progressive and stable Government in its pursuit of a better life for its people.
47.	It is commendable and perhaps prophetic that Zimbabwe was born as the fruit of lengthy international negotiations. The accession to independence of Zimbabwe and its admission to the United Nations is a great achievement for the international community. Independence could not have come at a better time than on the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is encouraging to note that, in these troubled times, peaceful negotiation has proved mightier than military action. Those who assisted and contributed to the achievement of Zimbabwe's independence deserve our high praise.
48.	Closer to my own country are the two new independent island nations, namely Kiribati and Vanuatu, the latter formerly known as New Hebrides. Their peaceful transition to independence is both an achievement by, and a tribute to, the inhabitants and the administering Powers. We look forward to developing firmer and closer cooperative relations with them.
49.	Our support for decolonization has been expressed many times here and elsewhere. We have stressed the right of dependent peoples to choose their own form of government and determine their own destiny. In the last three decades most of us have made that choice and taken up the challenge. It is our hope that in the next decade the remaining dependent Territories will make their choice and join us in this community of nations. Those Territories are not many, but the focus is definitely on them. Concern for such Territories will undoubtedly intensify. The United Nations has played a most fruitful and constructive role in this area. We see its continuing involvement as essential and valuable.
50.	I am sure that the remaining colonial Powers are well aware of this. Awareness is one thing; but the crucial issue is to take positive and substantive steps towards decolonization. There are many avenues open. Some of them have been trodden by many of us. Some of us have had to struggle very hard to convince or even force the administering Powers to grant independence, whilst some of us did not have to strive so hard. Thus, the attitudes and policies of the remaining metropolitan Powers will largely influence the course taken by our dependent colleagues.
51.	Papua New Guinea is particularly concerned with the remaining dependent peoples of the Pacific area. We note that some metropolitan Powers have taken positive steps to create a suitable climate in which a real choice can be made by South Pacific islanders. They have done so voluntarily. We are proud to call them friends. They have nothing to hide and nothing to lose. They can only gain the goodwill, gratitude and friendship of the peoples they administer. We salute and commend them, for they have a strong commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter.
52.	In the South Pacific the path to independence has been gained without acrimony. We would like to see that trend continue. Unfortunately, in Vanuatu an armed insurrection influenced by foreigners has clouded their excellent record. Nevertheless, the successful resolution of this issue through cooperative effort within the South Pacific community of nations demonstrates our commitment to regional solidarity and decolonization. Our hope is to see the remaining dependent Territories take their true place with us through peaceful means. We therefore call upon all remaining metropolitan Powers in the South Pacific to help to keep this record intact.
53.	I shall now turn to disarmament and international security. My Government sees the question of disarmament to be of utmost importance to international peace and security. We strongly believe that lasting peace and security cannot be built on the accumulation of weapons. Genuine and lasting peace can be created only through the effective implementation of the security system outlined in the Charter of the United Nations.
54.	General and complete disarmament under effective international control should be the principal objective for ensuring the survival of mankind and eliminating the danger of war, thus ensuring that war is no longer used as an instrument for settling disputes. It is our desire that the peoples of this world have peace and security, so that we can all concentrate our efforts on the development and improvement of the lives of our peoples. I am sure that we all desire peace and security. Unfortunately, greed and selfishness have made this wish only a dream.
55.	The Disarmament Decade, introduced by resolution 2602 E (XXIV) of the General Assembly, came to a close at the end of 1979. My Government is disappointed that there was neither real progress made towards a reduction of arms nor any negotiations leading to a treaty on general and complete disarmament. Even the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons' ended without any agreement.
56.	However, we note with some satisfaction the signing of the SALT II agreement. Disappointingly, the agreement has not been ratified. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that some international agreement such as the comprehensive test ban treaty will be negotiated and agreed to as soon as possible. In this connection, we welcome the General Assembly's decision to declare the 1980s as the Second Disarmament Decade and hope that something concrete will be achieved during this period.
57.	My delegation is opposed to all forms of nuclear testing, atmospheric or otherwise. We are equally opposed to the dumping of nuclear wastes everywhere, in particular in the South Pacific region, where nuclear testing takes place. These tests and nuclear waste dumpings are endangering our environment and our lives. Our desire is to preserve our many beautiful islands for our future generations. We therefore once again call upon responsible Governments to cease all forms of nuclear testing and nuclear waste dumping in the Pacific. This is because we do not believe that the tests and low-level nuclear waste dumpings in the Pacific region are harmless. Indeed, the long-term effects could be catastrophic. As a demonstration of faith in their own technology, the nations responsible should carry out their nuclear tests and dumping of nuclear wastes within their immediate boundaries.
58.	The thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time of deteriorating stability in the Middle East. We are concerned about the war between Iraq and Iran. The untold misery brought to the innocent in the conflict must be viewed with grave concern. We are also concerned that, if the situation is not resolved quickly, there is a real possibility that the conflict will escalate, causing the oil supplies to be substantially cut with the danger of bringing about a worldwide economic recession. The third world will suffer greatly because of our great dependency on these oil supplies. We commend the untiring efforts of the Secretary General and the Islamic Conference in trying to have the parties stop the fighting and resolve their disputes by meaningful discussions.
59.	My Government is troubled by the continuing failure to find a solution to the longstanding problems that exist between Israel and the Palestinian people. We are mindful of the right of all parties to the dispute to exist within recognized and secure boundaries. We believe that if there is to be peace then there must be respect by each for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the others. Unless positive measures are taken by all concerned, any attempt to restore peace will fail.
60.	Moreover, my Government regrets the recent action taken by Israel in enacting legislation to change the character and status of Jerusalem. This is contrary to the spirit of the Camp David accords and the peace process. The legislation is a serious obstruction to achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
61.	Papua New Guinea is geographically far removed from events in the Middle East, but we do not think for a moment that we can divorce ourselves from the enormous problems that beset this region of the world. The dispute between the United States and Iran cannot be resolved if the Iranian Government continues to hold the American hostages. Obviously such action by Iran does not help to minimize the tension in the area. It aggravates it. Papua New Guinea notes that Iran, as a signatory to the Geneva Convention on diplomatic privileges and immunities, has by its seizure of the hostages flouted international law and the law of humanity. Already elsewhere we have seen a similar series of attacks on diplomatic missions. We fear more future violations by political extremists. Because of our fear and concerns, we will support any call by the United Nations and vigilant Governments to deter further violations of diplomatic missions. We support the previous calls for Iran to effect immediately the unconditional release of the American hostages.
62.	Adding to the problems of the Middle East is the question of the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet troops. We call once again on the Soviet forces to withdraw without delay so that the people of Afghanistan can be free once again to determine the course of their future. Independence and basic democratic rights cannot be practised in circumstances of insecurity and foreign interference. The principle of territorial integrity must be respected.
63.	I turn now to events in IndoChina and the question of IndoChinese refugees. My Government is concerned over the security implications along the Thai-Kampuchean border and the refugee problem. We are aware that the refugee problem is a complex one. There may not be any easy solution, but a solution can be found if all parties show a positive and political willingness to cooperate. Basically there are two refugee problem areas. First, its cause and, secondly, its results. The more crucial of the two is the cause. We should do our utmost to eradicate the cause. Once this is achieved, we believe the whole refugee problem will surely disappear..
64.	The other concern is the results, that is, the flow of refugees from their homeland. It is our duty to find a solution. Several international conferences have sought means to end the flow of refugees. The ones my delegation endorses are General Assembly resolution 34/22, the Tokyo Economic Summit of industrial nations, held in June 1979, and the Geneva conference on the special problems of Indo Chinese refugees. We support the efforts made by the Secretary General to bring. Viet Nam and Thailand to the conference table to discuss their differences. We also support the calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and for the holding of a free and democratic general election under the supervision of the United Nations. We share the view of other countries that the donors of aid to Viet Nam should focus their efforts on the resettlement and rehabilitation of the IndoChinese refugees.
65.	But we cannot treat these two areas as separate problems any more than a physician can treat the symptoms of a contagious disease without being seriously concerned about the eradication of the disease altogether. My country is worried that we may handle the results of the refugee problem too well. We may encourage some nations to use our refugee management programmes as a means for exporting elements of their societies viewed by authoritarian Governments as being, for one reason or another, undesirable. In brief, there is evidence that some Governments will use the United Nations refugee programmes as a means of dumping their unwanted citizens onto the already overburdened United Nations refugee facilities and onto the strained resources of those generous nations that open their borders and their hearts to these disinherited people.
66.	We must devote as much of our limited resources to the solution of the cause of the refugee problem as we are applying to the results. We must find the basic causes of this inhumanity of man to man and root them out.
67.	In addition to the regional problems to which I have just referred, there are some more general subjects of worldwide significance upon which I should like to touch. These include the subject of human rights.
68.	My Government takes pleasure in noting the measures taken by States Members of this body to safeguard human rights. But there are still too many instances where some Governments continue to deny basic rights to their citizens. The denial of basic human rights on any grounds—racial, political, economic or any other arbitrary grounds—gives rise to injustices which my Government finds totally intolerable. My Government appeals to the international community to condemn those Governments which persist in violating basic human rights. We call on the Governments which violate such rights to take prompt and effective action to respect the dignity of their citizens as well as that of those citizens whose countries were taken by force.
69.	My Government notes with regret that the racist regime of South Africa continues to suppress and exploit the black peoples of that country. It is obvious that the Government of South Africa considers black people to be inferior, that they should live less comfortably and be denied the wealth and privileges that have been earned more often than not through the sweat and toil of black South Africans.
70.	The ghettos of Soweto are an affront to the dignity of man and an indictment of the callous, degrading and inhuman policies of the racist South African regime. I reiterate the fears my delegation expressed last year on the question of apartheid. Persistent failure to deal effectively with this abhorrent offence to mankind is likely to have an horrendous outcome for both the white and black populations of South Africa.
71.	My delegation is disappointed that, despite many pleas, the South African Government remains steadfast in its determination that the black man will be prevented from seeking the freedom and fulfilment that is the right of every human being. Further, my delegation is concerned at the contradictory stance many Members of the United Nations have taken on this issue. On the one hand, some nations, both developed and developing, endorse the view that apartheid is barbaric and has no place in the world. Yet these same nations lend considerable support to the Government of South Africa through active trade relations. If the United Nations is seriously opposed to apartheid, it should take positive steps to bring maximum pressure to bear on the Government of South Africa to abolish apartheid. We believe properly enforced trade embargoes would eventually force South Africa to relent and to adopt a more humane attitude towards its black peoples.
72.	Papua New Guinea compliments the Secretary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and the Council for Namibia on the role they are playing in seeking a solution to the Namibian problem. My Government learnt with contempt and indignation that the Government of South Africa's illegal administration in Namibia had installed a so-called Ministerial Council as the governing body of the territory of Namibia. This action by the racist Government of South Africa is in total defiance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. It is a further sign of South Africa's refusal to comply with the Security Council plan for free and fair elections, under United Nations supervision, to bring Namibia to genuine independence.
73.	The international community today recognizes the need to move quickly towards a New International Economic Order, even though there exist differing views on major proposals that have been put forward. The Government of Papua New Guinea is deeply concerned at the slow progress being made.
74.	The attempt to regulate world trade in primary commodities, the reform of the external framework for the industrialization of developing countries, the reform of the international monetary system and the strengthening of economic cooperation among developing countries are still outstanding issues. There are many reasons why they have not been resolved and I do not propose to go into them. But I should like to say that one of the main reasons has been the opposition from developed countries, with the result that conferences, such as the fifth session of UNCTAD, held at Manila in 1979, have repeatedly failed to achieve agreement on any one of the issues that I have mentioned.
75.	If the international community has learned anything in recent years, it has surely been that the economic welfare of each sovereign nation depends on a network of interdependence. My Government is deeply concerned at the failure of the long-awaited world recovery to come about. We believe the current economic problems cannot be blamed on the management of individual national economies. The management of each economy is becoming dependent on the external environment. Recovery and development require enlightened attitudes of mutual appreciation of each other's needs, interests and problems. Without such an appreciation, the prospect that any dialogue between developed and developing countries will lead to constructive changes in the international economic order must be regarded as gloomy indeed.
76.	A concrete example of international cooperation for development is the Lome Convention on trade and aid between the European Community and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.  The long negotiations on a successor agreement were finalized and signed on 31 October 1979.  It appears that the successor agreement will, in general, be similar to the previous one. However, the Lome II agreement contains a new mechanism which purports to assist mineral exporting countries. The Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the conclusion of the Lome Convention. But we have reservations about the new mechanism in that it offers assistance only to countries which have suffered a reduction in their capacity to produce certain minerals and export them to the European Market. The assistance itself is restricted to project or programme aid confined to the mineral sector and designed to restore production or export capacity. There is no help for those countries, including my own, which have suffered a loss of Government revenue as a result of low export prices.
77.	All developing countries are concerned that, in a harsh world, the poor countries are supposed to be grateful for what they are offered and should not expect to have a say in what the offer contains. Such a situation gives rise to extreme difficulties in the formulation of plans for development, as long as developing countries, to which category my country clearly belongs, are not given a greater say in deciding how they are to be helped. We will continue to face great difficulties in providing for the basic needs of our people. A classic example is the International Cocoa Agreement which was broken in March this year because consumer and producer could not come to an agreement on any acceptable price.
78.	Despite the frustrating lack of progress that seems to characterize these negotiations, when they are viewed from the broader perspective of their entire span, it appears that some convergence of views has taken place. There is some evidence of agreement in specific areas and most certainly the negotiations should continue. They represent the greatest challenge and the best hope for a mutually constructive future for the fullest development of our nations.
79.	I have highlighted some crucial issues that beset our times. Some of these issues have remained unresolved for some time. We should, nevertheless, be encouraged by the fact that they have not been long with us if we take the history of mankind into account. Most of our problems have arisen only in the last decade or so. A majority of them is brought upon us by ourselves, mostly as a result of our human weakness. The tendency to gain prestige and the desire to accumulate wealth for oneself seem to be the root cause of all our problems.
80.	Despite these human frailties, it is worth noting that we do make a commendable attempt at resolving or soothing the effects of these problems. I refer in particular to the part played by the United Nations to bring about just and practicable solutions.
81.	The United Nations is a world parliament to which the majority of our people belong. It has a vital role to play; it has done some good work for the world and has failed in some areas. It must not be allowed to become a stumbling block to the advancement of mankind. Let us make it work so as to produce good results for the present and future generations. We can only arrive at our goals if we are sensitive enough, if we are realistic and practical in our approach to the problems around us. Let us make a fresh start in order to build a better world for all mankind.
"
4884,69,2014,KIR,"I bring everyone warm greetings 
from the people of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am once 
again privileged to address this body. In my country we 
begin all formal addresses by conferring blessings of 
peace and good health on all present, so let me say Kam 
na bane ni Mauri.

I echo the sentiments conveyed by previous 
speakers in congratulating the President on assuming 
the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-
ninth session. I am confident that under his able 
stewardship, our Organization will continue its work 
towards improving the security and quality of life for 
all members of our global community, in particular 
the most vulnerable. Let me also take this opportunity 
to acknowledge with appreciation the commendable 
leadership of his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for his 
guidance and stewardship over the past year.

I also wish to commend the unwavering commitment 
and hard work of our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban 
Ki-moon, who has served as an able navigator of our 
family’s ship, steering the United Nations through 
the diverse and complex realities and the myriad of 
challenges facing our peoples and nations around the 
world. In particular, I wish to commend his sterling 
leadership and demonstrated personal commitment to 
the need to focus global attention on those who are most 
vulnerable and who are on the front line of the many 
major challenges facing us today as a global community.

We meet at a very critical time in the history of 
multilateralism. The global community is in the process 
of shaping a post-2015 development framework. We 
are hearing stronger calls for United Nations reforms, 
for reassessing the way we do things in our family of 
nations. The membership is calling for a move away 
from business as usual and for transformational 
changes. We welcome the theme of the sixty-ninth 
session — “Delivering on and implementing a 
transformative post-2015 development agenda” — as it 
aptly captures the call for changes by the membership.

Earlier this week, on Tuesday, we concluded one of 
the most successful conferences ever convened by the 
Secretary-General on climate change. We applaud the 
leadership and the Secretary-General’s very positive 
initiative. Those of us on the front line of the impacts 
of climate change welcome the renewed focus and the 
rallying by the United Nations membership behind the 
Secretary-General’s call for ambitious announcements 
and commitments. The real challenge, however, is 
in being able to translate those commitments and 
announcements into action.

Three weeks ago, Samoa hosted the Third 
International Conference on Small Island Developing 
States. The United Nations and those who attended 
declared it a resounding success. We thank our gracious 
hosts — the Government and the people of Samoa. 
Those very successful conferences signify recognition 
by the United Nations and the membership of the need 
to highlight the special case of those on the front line 
of sustainable development, to refocus global attention 
to the prevailing socioeconomic and environmental 
challenges that continue to constrain efforts by small 
island developing States (SIDS) to achieve sustainable 
development. That is particularly pertinent now, as the 
international community is in the process of shaping 
the post-2015 development agenda.

The Small Island Developing States Accelerated 
Modalities of Action provides a clear blueprint of 
how the SIDS want to move forward in their efforts 
to achieve sustainable development. The real test of 
the success of the Samoa Conference, however, is in 
the adoption of outcomes into genuine and durable 
partnerships that can translate into activities on the 
ground that will deliver tangible benefits to our people.

While SIDS heard the plight of some of the most 
vulnerable, other United Nations processes are talking 
about the graduation of those countries from the least 
developed countries category. We believe that there is 
a contradiction here. If we as a family of nations do 
not act and do not work in partnership with those on 
the front line of major challenges, whatever they may 
be, then we will have failed in our efforts. I would like 
to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-
General for his demonstrated commitment and 
leadership in focusing the United Nations and global 
attention on the plight of the most needy, in alleviating 
poverty, addressing the Ebola epidemic, raising the 
voices of youth and women and their participation in 
development, ending gender-based violence, promoting 
peace and security, and acting against climate change 
now.

As I have highlighted on numerous occasions 
in the past, including earlier this week, the issue 
of climate change remains the most single pressing 
challenge for us in Kiribati. Climate change is an 
existential challenge for low-lying island countries like 
mine, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives and 

Tokelau, and I again call for urgent global action to 
help those countries adapt and for international legally 
binding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions. 
The global community cannot afford to not listen to our 
stories and to the plight of our peoples. Our plight is the 
plight of the global community, further down the line. 
Everyone’s future is on the line.

I have just returned from an Arctic expedition, to 
the North Pole — hence, my loss of voice. I am still 
overwhelmed today by what I witnessed with my own 
eyes. The melting of the massive sheets of ice in the 
Arctic region due to climate change will not only have 
severe impacts on the lives of people in that region but 
will also result in the demise of future generations in 
other parts of the globe, in particular our most vulnerable 
atoll island nations. It has been an eye-opener for me 
to spend time in the past week in polar conditions. It 
gave me a wider perspective of the immensity of what 
is at stake beyond our own immediate concerns. That 
visit to the Arctic region highlighted the stark reality 
of the very direct connection between the destruction 
of that polar region to what is happening to us in the 
equatorial region, and the very unlikely possibility of 
ever reversing that process once it has gone so far.

On Tuesday we heard the voice of a very talented 
young woman, Ms. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a poet from 
our part of the world, from the Marshall Islands. Her 
voice represents the apprehension, the concern and the 
voice of mothers from low-lying countries like ours 
who lament what the future holds for their children 
and their children’s children. Surely, we as leaders and 
the mothers like Kathy and millions of others around 
the world share, or should share, the same ultimate 
goal — to leave to our children and grandchildren a 
future that is better than what we inherited from our 
forefathers. We from Kiribati salute Kathy for reaching 
out and for touching the hearts of leaders who heard 
her speak. May she touch many hearts and move many 
more hearts.

The very sad reality is that we are just not on 
course to achieve that. It is glaringly obvious that 
we need to do things differently. We owe it to those 
whom we represent — our people. For us, climate 
change is not an event in the future. It is an event that 
we are dealing with today. We simply cannot talk of 
sustainable development without talking about climate 
change. Earlier this week, I appealed to fellow leaders, 
and will do so again today, for all of us to work together 
against climate change and to move towards binding 
international agreements, towards a clean energy 
future, a healthier greener future for our children and a 
healthier, greener home for our one planet, Earth.

What are we doing? Let us accept full responsibility 
for our own development to improve the well-being of 
our people into the future. We are determined to achieve 
that by finding national solutions to overcome the 
enormous development challenges that constrain our 
efforts. My Government has mainstreamed sustainable 
development principles into our national development 
plan, policies and strategies. Climate change and 
adaptation measures are integrated into our national 
budgeting process and development programmes to 
strengthen disaster risk management. We have adopted 
an inclusive, whole-of-government and whole-of-nation 
approach aimed at addressing climate change impacts 
and strengthening our resilience.

Our strategy for migration with dignity is an 
investment in the education of our people and upping 
the skills of our young population to equip them with 
the educational qualifications and employable skills 
that will enable them to migrate with dignity to other 
countries as a matter of choice and, in the worst-case 
scenario, when our islands can no longer sustain human 
life.

Last July, along with other frontline low-lying atoll 
island States — Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Maldives 
and Tokelau — Kiribati initiated the establishment of 
the Coalition of Low-lying Atoll Nations on Climate 
Change (CANCC). The Coalition held its inaugural 
meeting in Tarawa in July and produced an outcome 
document that embraces the Coalition’s goals and 
vision for building the resilience of our people in the 
face of the challenges of climate change. The initiative 
is prompted by the concerns we share regarding the 
increasing severity of those challenges and the slow 
pace of global action to address them. Our Coalition of 
nations continues to support the ongoing negotiations 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, but we also emphasize that urgent 
action must be taken now to assist our countries and 
all vulnerable communities to adapt to the impacts of 
climate change.

The Coalition initiative demonstrates our political 
commitment and determination to find innovative 
solutions to the threats we face from climate change. 
We are looking at building up our low islands and 
climate-proofing our infrastructure, and at our 

development efforts to prepare and build the resilience 
of our people in the face of the challenge.

We cannot do this alone, and we acknowledge the 
support of our development partners and regional and 
international organizations that have assisted us and 
continue to support our efforts to address the challenge 
of climate change. However, much more remains to be 
done, including making climate-financing facilities 
more accessible and flexible, as the solutions and 
options for facing this challenge vary from nation to 
nation.

The ocean plays a pivotal role in the sustainable 
development of my country. Our vision for achieving 
sustainable development hinges on the blue 
economy — on the conservation and sustainable 
management of our marine and ocean resources. 
While we in Kiribati have been labelled a small 
island developing State, we are in fact a “large ocean” 
State that spans an ocean area of 3.5 million square 
kilometres. The ocean has been an integral part of 
our life since time immemorial. While it now poses a 
serious threat to our survival from sea-level rise, it also 
provides immense opportunities, not only as a source 
of daily sustenance, but also as a means through which 
we can realize sustainable development and achieve 
livelihoods for our people.

Our exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is one of the 
largest in the world and is home to abundant tuna 
resources that provide rich fishing grounds for our 
distant fishing partners. We estimate that the total 
annual landed value of the fisheries industry in our 
EEZ is approximately $4 billion. Yet only 5 to 8 per 
cent of that comes to us as resource owners, through 
licensing fees. We have to ask, where is the equity and 
fairness in that?

There is a need to review and restructure the 
nature of public and private partnerships in the fishing 
industry. A more equitable partnership based on mutual 
respect, goodwill, fairness and accountability will go 
a long way in providing an enabling environment for 
sustainable development.

My Government is working to maximize the returns 
from our large fisheries resource through value-adding 
fisheries development, including on-shore processing. 
Our limited capacity in terms of capital, technical 
know-how, a lack of infrastructure, distance from 
commercial and trade centres and air and sea transport 
challenges stands in the way of our progress towards 
that development aspiration. Direct foreign investment 
and genuine partnership are therefore a way forward 
in that regard. I am confident that such partnership, 
forged around an equitable distribution of gains, will 
be the development model going forward, with mutual 
gains to be made.

Human activities have been responsible for the 
accelerated degradation of our global environment, in 
the pursuit of short-term economic gains without due 
regard to the health of our oceans and our environment. 
Never in human history has the health of our oceans 
and planet Earth been so challenged. We all have a 
shared responsibility and obligation with regard to the 
protection of the ocean from further degradation and 
the sustainable management of its rich biodiversity.

My country recognizes that shared responsibility 
and, in 2008, established the Phoenix Islands Protected 
Area (PIPA) in partnership with Conservation 
International and the New England Aquarium. 
UNESCO has inscribed PIPA on its list of World 
Heritage Sites. In January 2015, we will completely 
close off the Phoenix Islands Protected Area to all 
commercial fishing activity across an area of more than 
410,000 square kilometres, representing 11 per cent of 
our total EEZ — about the size of the state of California.

PIPA is a rich fishing ground, so its total closure 
on 31 December this year will entail loss of much-
needed revenue for Kiribati from fishing licence fees. 
For us, it is a major but necessary short-term sacrifice 
for the long-term health of our ocean and for sustaining 
fish stocks for global food security. It demonstrates 
our political commitment to the importance of marine 
conservation and the sustainable management of marine 
resources. It is our contribution to humankind and the 
common good of all.

But the announcement of complete closure of this 
vast marine protected area will amount to nothing 
without monitoring and enforcement. We have therefore 
established a PIPA trust fund to support our national 
efforts in managing PIPA and monitoring that vast 
marine protected area. We thank those who share our 
vision and have contributed to the fund. We encourage 
our partners who have not yet done so to join with us in 
that massive undertaking.

The challenges we face in the twenty-first century 
have taken on a new dimension. It is no longer a fight 
to save a species here and a collapsed stock there; 
the fight has become larger. It is now about how to 

ensure the survival of whole peoples — communities, 
villages, cities and nations. Entire ecosystems hang in 
the balance, the ecosystems that provide us with the air 
we breathe, the water we drink and much of the food we 
eat. It is time to view our global development in a whole 
new way. It is time to change business as usual. Indeed, 
a paradigm shift and transformational development 
approaches are necessary, starting from within our own 
nations and moving out to regional and international 
multilateral processes, institutions and partnerships.

It is high time we recognize that the new challenges 
require that we draw on all the resources available to the 
global community. Development and global challenges 
do not belong to Governments alone. Let us bring in our 
youth, our women, civil society, the private sector and 
our traditional institutions. Let us be inclusive. Let all 
those who have a contribution to make make it.

We welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the 
international processes of the World Health Assembly. 
We hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail 
in respect of our other international institutions and the 
United Nations processes, where Taiwan and all those 
that can participate and contribute meaningfully for the 
good of humankind can be brought in to do so.

We join in the broad international condemnation 
of criminal extremism and express the hope that such 
destabilizing tensions in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region 
and elsewhere can be settled through peaceful means. 
As distant as we think we are from the epicentres of 
such events, they nonetheless impact on us in a very 
real way in our part of the world.

In my country, even before the advent of climate 
change, the atoll environment was indeed harsh. Life 
on the low-lying atoll islands has always been difficult. 
We have always worked on the principle of working 
together as part of a community on the premise that 
there will be some challenges that are larger than us and 
need collaboration. The age-old test of our resilience 
and our strength as a community is defined by the well-
being of the weakest member of our community. For us, 
sustainable development must be inclusive. It requires 
sincerity, goodwill, respect and the willingness to move 
a little more slowly so as to assist and bring everyone 
on board in order to move forward together.

I would like to bring those principles to the United 
Nations. The pursuit of sustainable development 
and lasting peace and security calls for and requires 
sacrifice. It requires inclusiveness. It requires 
collective and decisive action. It also requires political 
commitment and political leadership from all of us 
here, for the time to act is now.

On that note, I leave members with the traditional 
blessing: may health, peace and prosperity be with us 
all.
"
4889,69,2014,PLW,"Without trying to be 
melodramatic, I believe that my country, the Pacific 
region and the world have reached a crossroads. In 
this International Year of Small Island Developing 
States, leading up to the climate change negotiations 
at the twentieth and twenty-first Conferences of the 
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change, the third International Conference 
on Financing for Development and the impending 
adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, viewed 
within the context of our rising oceans, the Ebola crisis 
in Africa and the apparent societal inferno in progress 
in the Arab world, we find our societies, our cultures 
and our economies under serious attack, never before 
experienced on so many fronts. We can continue 
business as usual along our current course and wait for 
the horizons to clear the global haze or we can choose a 
different road, one that will give our critical habitats the 
chance to recover and thereby ensure their continued 
ability to sustain us. Am I a foolish dreamer or a simple 
pragmatist? I guess that only time will tell.

However, I will say one thing. My country, small 
as it is, will not go down without a fight, using every 
available tool, nor will the Pacific region, whose people 
comprehend first-hand the real and current impacts 
of climate change and recognize that their oceans are 
becoming polluted and their fish stocks depleted. That 
is why the Pacific leaders at this year’s Pacific Islands 
Forum supported the Palau Declaration under the 
theme “The ocean: life and future”. Within that theme 
and Declaration, the Pacific leaders highlighted the fact 
that, in order to survive, we will have to continue to play 
a central role in the stewardship of one of the greatest 
endowments of the world — the Pacific Ocean. That is 
because, in our short lifetime, we have experienced a 
dangerous combination of human impacts that threaten 
the foundation of our Pacific livelihoods.

That is why we have called on the global community 
to support the efforts of the Forum countries to 
sustainably use their ocean resources and to conserve 
their valuable underwater heritage. That is why Palau, 
Kiribati, the Cook Islands, New Caledonia, the United 
States of America, the Federated States of Micronesia and 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands are currently in the 
process of declaring and establishing protected marine 
areas of different sizes and requirements to reverse 
the current trends of overuse and overexploitation and 
thereby ensure a healthy ocean for our children.

That is why we are committed to ensuring the launch 
of negotiations by September 2015 for an international 
agreement under the United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable 
use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of 
national jurisdiction. That is why we are calling upon 
the United Nations to ensure a stand-alone sustainable 
development goal (SDG) on oceans.

However, while we are strongly in favour of that 
critical SDG, we are concerned that the post-2015 
development dialogue may be too broad. We must 


remember that an agenda of everything is effectively 
an agenda of nothing. Above all, our goals and targets 
must be realistic, practical, simple, transparent and 
measurable. In that context, we must continue to focus 
on the vulnerable countries and the people most in need. 
To accomplish that objective, we must recognize that 
one size does not fit all and that we must continue to 
concentrate on a common but differentiated response.

Our international community has years of 
experience of what does and does not work with our 
Millennium Development Goals. It is now time to 
complete the work on the remaining half and to continue 
to improve both the level and the responsiveness of our 
financing mechanisms. We must also ensure that the 
bulk of the financing reaches those that need it most 
and that their share is not a mere drop in the bucket.

In the Pacific, we believe action must begin 
in one’s own backyard. In my country, in the next 
several months, we will formalize the establishment 
of a national marine sanctuary, which will include a 
complete prohibition on purse seine fishing that covers 
100 per cent of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), 
a “no-take” marine sanctuary that covers 80 per cent 
of the Palau EEZ; a highly regulated fishing zone that 
covers approximately 20 per cent of the EEZ and will 
provide for Palau’s domestic fishing needs alone; and a 
prohibition on commercial fish exports. Through our 
global actions and our partnerships between developing 
and developed nations and between the private and 
the public sectors, we can achieve a transformational 
shift in the way we think about the use of our Earth’s 
natural assets. By recognizing the ocean as a joint and 
primary asset of every citizen on our planet, we can 
move towards the global management of our global 
ocean exclusive economic zone.


We must never shift from the need for a global 
climate change initiative that addresses the threat to 
all people of all nations. Climate change is our planet’s 
silent war. It must not remain on the back pages of our 
minds and our global commitments. We must move it 
to the front page, alongside global conflicts, so that it 
receives the attention and the financing that it deserves. 
And we must understand that, in terms of public health, 
climate change is a defining issue for our century.

Climate change affects the air that we breathe, 
the food that we eat, the water that we drink and 
the infectious diseases that find their way into our 
homes. Our world leaders, whether from developed or 
developing countries, must overcome the failures of our 
own lost generation. As the Secretary-General said, the 
race is on, and now is the time for leaders to step up and 
steer the world towards a safer future. A temperature 
increase of 3.6 degrees is simply not acceptable. If that 
is the best objective that our global leaders can agree 
on, we may as well throw in the towel and stop having 
children, because there will be no future for them.

By the end of 2015, our global leaders must 
announce a new direction with new and realistic 
commitments and practical actions, supported by 
a greatly enhanced financial commitment both to 
mitigation and to adaptation. Those commitments must 
include the ratification of the second amendment to 
the Kyoto Protocol. Within our discussions, migration 
should not be an option. As the young mother Kathy 
Jetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall Islands put it so 
beautifully on Tuesday, “No one is moving. No one is 
losing their homeland. No one is becoming a climate 
change refugee”.

Our small island nations, which are the first to 
feel the impacts of climate change, the first to feel the 
impacts of diminished marine resources and the first to 
wet our feet in sea-level rise, are ready and willing to 
lead. We do not call for action from developed nations 
that we are not willing to take ourselves. Last year, my 
country committed, under the Majuro Declaration for 
Climate Leadership, to a 20 per cent contribution of 
renewable energy to the energy mix and a 30 per cent 
reduction in energy consumption by 2020. We are well 
on the way to achieving those goals.

Since its independence, Palau has been blessed 
with strong partnerships. For over 50 years, the United 
States has provided its support and friendship. Without 
its support to Palau’s transition, revenue independence 
and infrastructure development, we would not be where 
we are today. Palau stands strongly behind the United 
States in its ongoing efforts to guide the international 
response to the horrific situation in Syria and Iraq 
and its actions to respond to the threat of the Islamic 
State in Iraq and Sham. Let us not forget that global 
peace and stability are critical if we are to achieve 
our development agenda and respond to the issues of 
climate change and ocean regeneration.

We wish to give special thanks for President 
Obama’s support for oceans and the expressed intent 
to set aside 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine 


protected areas. Finally, we thank the United States for 
past and future technical and financial assistance in our 
efforts to implement our National Marine Sanctuary. 
We continue to look forward to finally completing our 
Compact of Free Association agreement, which reflects 
this close and special relationship.

Palau would also like to acknowledge the very 
significant economic support that we have received 
over the years from our good friend, Japan. We are 
hopeful that the Security Council expansion and reform 
process will result in Japan’s permanent membership 
on the Security Council. We also are hopeful that Japan 
will continue to support and enhance public and private 
assistance to our exclusive economic zone surveillance 
efforts and our continued efforts to develop our National 
Marine Sanctuary.

In addition, Palau would like to thank the Republic 
of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic 
support in assisting Palau to achieve our Millennium 
Development Goals and would urge the United Nations 
system to involve Taiwan in the process of developing 
and implementing the post-2015 development agenda. 
I would also call upon the United Nations to support 
Taiwan’s broader participation in the United Nations 
specialized agencies and regional economic integration 
mechanisms, as its participation in the World 
Health Assembly, the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement 
and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership 
would demonstrate its ability to contribute to global 
and regional initiatives.

We also would like to express our thanks to the 
Australian Government for its ongoing partnership, 
its annual aid assistance focused on education and 
its commitment to providing $2 billion to the Pacific 
region to replace its aging marine surveillance fleet.

Finally, we would like to recognize the very broad 
list of partners around the globe that make our efforts 
to ensure a sustainable future possible, including New 
Zealand, the European Union, private organizations, 
non-governmental organizations and civil society. 
Partnerships such as those are commitments. We would 
not be where we are today without them. In the post-
2015 development environment, we must all recognize 
that our actions as individuals, States, nations and 
regions have an impact on all our partners on planet 
Earth. If we are to save our oceans and if we are to stem 
the tide of greenhouse gases, we must establish a long-
lasting system of global partnerships and respect.

At the end of the day, we must recognize that some 
of us are developed and some of us are not. The means 
of implementation in terms of oceans, climate change, 
biodiversity and all of the other issues that require global 
solutions are therefore a recurring and central issue. 
Without effective partnerships, change will simply not 
occur, and without legally binding commitments with 
respect toour oceans and climate change, we will not 
make the transformative changes that we need to make 
in the next generation.

As a small island developing State and a member of 
the Pacific community, I am ready, willing and able to 
commit to doing my share. I am even willing to lead. 
But let us not fool ourselves. The only way to make a 
difference in this modem global era is to go beyond our 
self-centred mentality. By standing together, we can 
indeed craft a sustainable future for our children and 
for generations to come.
"
4895,69,2014,NRU,"Allow me to congratulate 
Mr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency 

of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. 
Let me assure him of my delegation’s full support and 
cooperation as he steers our work during this session. I 
must also commend his predecessor, Ambassador John 
Ashe, for showing such capable leadership during the 
previous session. He led the small island developing 
States (SIDS) through several important milestones 
during his tenure, including the International Year 
of Small Island Developing States and the recently 
concluded International Conference on SIDS in Samoa.

It has been said that the stars are aligned with SIDS 
this year. Ambassador Ashe has been our brightest 
beacon, and I thank him very much for that. Let me 
also thank another champion of the SIDS, Secretary-
General Ban Ki-moon. Indeed, earlier this year, I 
sat in the Trusteeship Council Chamber when the 
Secretary-General helped us celebrate the launch of the 
International Year of Small Island Developing States. 
Showing a remarkable understanding of our unique 
circumstances, he said:

“The International Year offers us the 
opportunity to celebrate the rich cultural heritage 
of the people of small island developing States and 
to honour their many contributions to our world. 
It is also an opportunity to highlight the various 
needs and challenges of this diverse coalition. 
Some small island developing States have enjoyed 
long-lasting stability. Others are in transition. Some 
are economically more fragile than others... Others 
are extremely vulnerable to the immediate effects 
of climate change. But all small island developing 
States share a common understanding. We need to 
set our world on a sustainable path.”
The challenges of SIDS are many. One need only 
glance at the headlines to appreciate that they join a 
long list of concerns that the international community 
must confront today: naked brutality, pestilence, 
poverty and the worsening impacts of climate change, 
to name only a few. I understand the impulse for us to 
put off hard decisions to another day, prioritize some 
over others, or even bury our heads in the sand. But 
the General Assembly is and remains the pre-eminent 
forum for grappling with global crises, and the United 
Nations is our best hope for solving them.

However, if we are to be successful, we must 
acknowledge a reality that lies beneath so many of those 
challenges, namely, that we live in an interconnected 
world and that the actions of one country or region 
impact the lives of people half a world away. Conflict, 
poverty and disease can send refugees across borders 
and oceans and sometimes all the way to our shores. 
We can no longer escape each other. As the Secretary-
General also remarked, we all share the same island.

Also, we must consider my country’s connection 
to the ocean. As for so many SIDS, the ocean is the 
foundation of our culture and economy, and we depend 
on its bounty for food and income. Yet the reckless 
actions of other nations have severely undermined the 
marine environment on which we so depend — from 
excessive greenhouse gas emissions that warm the 
planet and make the seas more and more acidic to 
irresponsible overfishing, the outright stealing of fish 
in our waters, and dangerous pollution, the effect of 
which we have yet to fully comprehend.

All the while, some of those same countries 
responsible for the damage are also charged with 
assessing the well-being of the marine environment. 
How can we be confident that our interests will be 
protected in that effort? We, as a developing country, 
are constantly facing demands for greater transparency 
and accountability from the same actors that downplay, 
and sometimes even cover up, their own transgressions.

Finding lasting solutions to problems such as 
those will require more resources and a level of 
cooperation that the international community has 
so far not countenanced. It will also require us to 
look at the failings in the global order that somehow 
prevent countries such as mine from accessing the fair 
economic benefits of our own resources. Nevertheless, 
we cannot just stand by and do nothing. We cannot and 
should not wait for others to decide what is best for us. 
For that reason, the parties to the Nauru Agreement 
are taking the lead in successfully managing their tuna 
stocks through such measures as curbing illegal fishing 
and sustainable harvesting.

The President has wisely chosen “Delivering on and 
implementing a transformative post-2015 development 
agenda” as the theme of the general debate of the 
sixty-ninth session. It goes to the heart of the central 
task before us — not only fulfilling the long-standing 
promises with regard to sustainable development but 
also engendering a paradigm shift in the way that we 
achieve such development. The current piecemeal 
approach, where a donor’s political interests determine 
aid priorities, may treat symptoms for a time, but it fails 
to address the underlying disease.


If we want our efforts to be successful over the 
long term, we need to build a foundation that develops 
global citizens and gives them the tools they need to 
succeed in a global world. In other words, we must 
move beyond capacity-building to institution-building. 
What is needed is long-term in-country engagement, 
backed by real resources, that produces durable 
domestic institutions run by nationals. We cannot let 
new and emerging issues distract or diminish work on 
core priorities that remain inadequately addressed. We 
may be experiencing our own fatigue when we again 
raise the issues of overfishing, climate adaptation and 
water treatment, but those are often the areas most in 
need of attention.

I know that tackling all of those problems will be a 
tall order and may seem quite daunting, I am absolutely 
confident that this institution and its agencies are up 
to the task. We have made some progress in reducing 
hunger, poverty and disease. And just this week, the 
world watched as leaders gathered at the Climate 
Summit to announce the actions that their countries and 
corporations are planning in order to lower greenhouse 
gas emissions responsible for the climate crisis. The 
Summit provided hope that, at least in some corners, 
serious climate action is imminent. However, it was 
hard to ignore the fact that most announcements were 
about the greenhouse gas reductions that would occur 
under some future Government a decade or more in the 
future.

What is more, SIDS, which contribute only a 
fraction of global emissions, have undertaken to build 
sustainable economies while announcing some of the 
most ambitious pledges to cut emissions. For example, 
we are working closely with the International Renewable 
Energy Agency, through their Lighthouses initiative, 
to achieve our own goal of a 50 per cent reduction 
in 2020. My own regional group, the Pacific SIDS, 
led the General Assembly to formally recognize the 
connection between climate change and international 
peace and security in 2009 and helped convince the 
Security Council to do the same in 2011.

But, while few countries doubt the correlation 
between climate change and conflict today and despite 
graphic examples of such in the past few years alone, 
there is still disagreement as to the way forward. 
Therefore, we are still of the opinion that the Secretary-
General should appoint a special representative on 
climate and security to analyse the projected security 
impacts of the crisis. In addition, the Secretary-General 
should lead a joint task force of all relevant organs 
and specialized agencies to assess the capacity of the 
United Nations system to respond. That is the least we 
can do as an international body to prepare for one of the 
biggest challenges of our generation.

If the Security Council is to remain relevant, it 
must be adaptive enough to meet the latest threats, and 
climate change is a clear and present danger that we 
ignore at our own peril. The Security Council must also 
reflect new geopolitical realities by becoming more 
representative and inclusive. It is for that reason that 
Nauru supports the reform of the Security Council by 
enlarging its permanent and non-permanent categories 
and making its working methods more efficient. New 
members should be more geographically diverse, 
but they must also be willing to broaden their vision 
beyond a narrow focus on domestic interests to include 
a commitment to the common good of all Member 
States.

Similarly, the United Nations should ensure that all 
citizens of the world have the opportunity to participate 
in its activities. It must work for the 10,000 people in 
Nauru and other small countries, and it must not continue 
to ignore the 24 million people in Taiwan, who time 
and again have demonstrated a commitment to peace 
and regional cooperation. Nauru is pleased to note that, 
with solid international support and the cross-Strait 
rapprochement, the Republic of China has increased its 
meaningful participation in United Nations specialized 
agencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage 
the positive interaction between the two sides of the 
Taiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore, 
I would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan 
has made to help my country make progress towards 
its national sustainable development strategy. I take 
the opportunity to also express my country’s deep 
appreciation to our friends and partners who continue 
to support our sustainable development priorities, 
including Australia, Russia, New Zealand, the European 
Union, Cuba, Israel and Turkey, to mention a few.

The world is rapidly changing, and the new realities 
have strained the ability of the United Nations to 
respond adequately. Long-term solutions will require 
a new commitment to providing adequate means of 
implementation. On climate change alone, we are far 
from the goal of providing $100 billion a year by 2020 
to help nations adapt to climate impacts that are now 
unavoidable and to build sources of clean energy, to say 


nothing of the 0.7 per cent gross domestic product goal 
for development aid.

I know that we, as an international community, face 
numerous crises on many fronts and that much is being 
asked of us. But I strongly believe that it is in times 
like these that solutions to even the most intractable 
problems emerge from the human spirit. It is in times 
like these that light emerges from darkness; hope from 
despair.

The small island developing States have laid out a 
vision to help us reach our full potential. I invite our 
partners to invest in our peoples, and we will build 
a better and more secure world. The United Nations 
remains our best hope for people everywhere to live 
in peace and prosperity. My faith in it has never been 
stronger. God bless the Republic of Nauru and God 
bless the United Nations.
"
4907,69,2014,MHL,"When the United Nations was 
founded nearly 70 years ago, it was created to fulfil the 
aspiration that peace and diplomacy could overcome 
self-interest and to ensure that, through effective 
cooperation, the world could avoid grave security 
threats. But the decades since the signing of the Charter 
of the United Nations have been marked by nearly as 
many failures as successes, and many of those failures 
could have been prevented by early action and stronger 
political will.

I am particularly concerned today about the recent 
events in Ukraine and the rapid spread of violent 
terrorism in Syria and Iraq, even though the Pacific 
Islands sit halfway around the world, a fragile region 


far away from the global super-Powers. The leaders of 
nations have in our hands the means either to respond 
with alert action or to turn our backs on a growing 
danger.

Climate change poses no less of a security threat 
to our Pacific shores, and, indeed, to the world. As a 
low-lying country, the Marshall Islands has no higher 
ground — nowhere to go — and we will not cede an 
inch to rising waters. Earlier this week, over 120 world 
leaders met in this Hall to signal our political will 
and our commitment. No one should take that lightly. 
Leaders simply cannot afford to play consensus games 
or to squabble.

Yet words and intentions alone do not meet the full 
challenge before us. There will be serious emissions 
gaps between what the world will do and what needs 
to be done to save my nation. Earlier this week, young 
poet and mother Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall 
Islands stepped onto this very same stage to urge world 
leaders to take action. Today, on behalf of the most 
vulnerable nations — those at the front line — I ask of 
the leaders of the largest nations, the major emitters, in 
Kathy’s very same words, to

“take us all along on your ride. We will not slow 
you down. We will help you win the most important 
race of all, the race to save humanity”.
Like no other global challenge, climate change 
requires direct political ownership and eye-to-eye 
engagement with leaders. This issue, more than any 
other, will define the Secretary-General’s legacy as 
leader of these united nations. I urge him not only to 
continue to show his commendable personal leadership, 
but also to use his good offices to help find creative 
political solutions.

Everyone — large and small, rich and poor — must 
and will take strong action on emissions. In that regard, 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly supports 
the Federated States of Micronesia, the United States 
of America, and many other nations in urging a rapid 
global phase-down of hydrofluorocarbon gases under 
the Montreal Protocol. I will personally attend the Paris 
climate conference next December, so that my voice 
and that of my people can be heard.

Unlike many other fights, the huge global fight to 
address climate change is also a personal one for me. 
It starts in my own backyard, with my own seawall, 
built with my own hands, to push back rising waters, 
save my own future and the future of my children 
and grandchildren. But that is not enough. We face a 
challenge that is nearly beyond belief. As with so many 
other moments in the history of the United Nations, we 
have to ask whether leaders will respond to the climate 
threat with courage. Or will some nations, including 
some close friends of the Pacific Islands, slide back in 
their efforts, bury their heads in the sand and ignore an 
obvious climate reality? I hope and expect that at the 
coming Group of Twenty meeting later this year, the 
world’s largest economies will address climate change 
and the economic consequences of inaction. The Pacific 
island countries demand no less.


Last month, nations around the world gathered in 
Apia for the third international conference on small 
island developing States. As hosts of the conference, 
the Government and people of Samoa showed the world 
true Pacific hospitality. As we have for decades, Pacific 
leaders have spoken firmly — in last year’s Majuro 
Declaration for Climate Leadership, in this year’s Palau 
Declaration on “The Ocean: Life and Future”, and again 
in the Small Island Developing States Accelerated 
Modalities of Action (SAMOA Pathway).

Our development needs are beyond urgent and 
must not to be put off for yet another year. While 
the SAMOA Pathway charts a course forward for 
international partnership with small islands, there is 
too often a mismatch between our national structures 
and complicated sources of assistance. It is my hope 
and expectation that the major announcements and 
partnerships from the Samoa Summit will not lose 
momentum because of poor connections in the 
delivery channels. Our needs are often modest, but 
the trickle-down of international assistance and 
global development somehow fails to reach our local 
communities and to meet our unique challenges.

In the follow-up to the Samoa meeting, starting 
this year I urge the Secretary-General, the international 
system and United Nations agencies to start thinking 
seriously about how to work more effectively with 
our unique challenges as island nations. As Member 
States design a post-2015 development agenda, it is 
important that we focus on a strong outcome that has 
the flexibility to accommodate the unique character 
of each nation. We cannot measure progress without 
specific benchmarks, but as a small nation we fear that 


having so many ambitions can be equivalent to having 
none at all. The answer is not to be isolated within a 
separate, unconnected island strategy, but rather to 
build the flexibility needed for so many nations to act 
as one.

I stand firm with my fellow Pacific leaders and 
nations around the world who have urged that there 
be a United Nations sustainable development goal on 
oceans. I am puzzled as to why some nations close their 
eyes to two thirds of the world’s surface, pretending 
that the world’s vast blue waters somehow do not exist. 
The Pacific Ocean and its rich fisheries are our lifeline. 
We are the custodians of our own vast resources on 
behalf of future generations.

We could introduce a step change in the world’s 
sustainable fisheries and play our own role to address 
global food security. Distant-water fishing nations must 
engage us as true development partners and work with 
us to change the focus beyond their immediate national 
industry and towards a global responsibility. Recent 
progress on sustainable fisheries has become the 
defining story of the Pacific — it is our empowerment 
and our future. The oceans are an equally valuable 
resource for alternate sustainable energy, including 
ocean thermal energy conversion.

Everyone should participate on the international 
stage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports 
Taiwan’s meaningful participation in United Nations 
specialized agencies and mechanisms, including 
the World Health Organization, the International 
Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well 
as in key regional economic integration mechanisms. 
Furthermore, I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the 
post-2015 development agenda and urge recognition 
of the important assistance provided to my country 
in health, education and energy. The Marshall Islands 
welcomes Taiwan’s efforts to reduce cross-Strait 
tensions and urges States Members of the United 
Nations to recognize and encourage such progress.

As a former United Nations Trust Territory, the 
Republic of the Marshall Islands has a unique legacy, 
shared by only a very few in this Hall. It was the United 
Nations that helped set us on a path to independence, but 
it was also the United Nations that explicitly authorized 
the 67 nuclear tests conducted in our nation between 
1946 and 1958. Our own history bears the burden and 
the contemporary impacts of those tests. Our suffering 
could have been prevented by the United Nations — if 
only its Members had listened. Like many other nations, 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands believes that 
awareness of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear 
weapons must underpin all approaches and efforts 
towards nuclear disarmament.

Those facts speak for themselves and were 
recognized two years ago by the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur. We look forward to addressing those issues 
further during our participation in the Human Rights 
Council universal periodic review next year. For the 
survival of humanity it is essential that nuclear weapons 
are never used again, under any circumstances. The 
universal way to accomplish that is through the total 
elimination of such weapons. It should be our collective 
goal as the United Nations to not only stop the spread 
of nuclear weapons, but also to pursue the peace and 
security of a world without them.

This year, I look forward to a United Nations that 
better recognizes the true global challenges of today 
and moves beyond old political cobwebs into our 
dynamic century.
"
4926,69,2014,VUT,"Vanuatu is honoured to 
join other speakers in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa 
on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at 
its sixty-ninth session. I believe that his able leadership 
will successfully guide the session to its conclusion. 
Let me also extend my gratitude to his predecessor, 
Ambassador John Ashe, for his exemplary leadership 
and the important achievements during his tenure in 
the past year.

Since the last session of the General Assembly, 
many major global events have taken place which, on 
the one hand, have contributed to strengthening the 
international system and, on the other, have threatened 
international peace and security and directly derailed the 
process of development, resulting in the marginalization 
of the vulnerable populations of our societies. Given 
past efforts to address the global financial crisis, we 
have witnessed some recovery of the global economy. 
That is good news; but it is well known that the recovery 

is fragile and further international efforts are needed to 
ensure that global growth prospects in the long run will 
remain solid and sustainable.

We are concerned about prolonged periods of 
conflict that have led to the displacement of the most 
disadvantaged members of our societies, including 
women, children and the disabled. It bothers us to see 
the increased radicalization of groups and individuals 
that have been targeted to create terror and impose 
threats against countries, Governments and citizens. 
Those are all problems that could be avoided, if all 
countries adhered strictly to the peaceful principles of 
dialogue enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. 
As members of the international community, we have a 
moral duty to ensure that the principles of dialogue and 
reasoning prevail in order to address conflict. I have 
no doubt that the multilateral system is best placed to 
address the challenges.

The outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that 
has claimed over 2,000 lives in West Africa has 
also concerned us greatly. In this regard, we highly 
commend the efforts of the United Nations agencies, 
in particular the World Health Organization, and the 
international community in addressing the security 
risks of the epidemic. Likewise, the efforts of the 
Secretary-General and his determination in addressing 
the challenges are most commendable. I would like 
to reiterate my Government’s support for the ongoing 
efforts.

Concerning the political developments in the Pacific 
region, I wish to congratulate the people of the Republic 
of Fiji on successfully and peacefully electing a new 
democratic Government. My Government commends 
the people of Fiji for their resilience and steadfastness, 
and I congratulate the newly elected Prime Minister on 
fulfilling his promise to the international community to 
successfully lead his country to a democratic election.

Vanuatu, a small island developing State, has a 
small economy which is open and vulnerable to internal 
and external shocks. Those characteristics have 
determined and shaped our development outcomes. For 
decades now, our economy has been growing and is now 
generating increasing per capita incomes. Vanuatu was 
one of the countries that called on the United Nations to 
allow vulnerability to become one of the three criteria 
used in assessing or identifying graduation cases. 
Vanuatu’s vulnerability was recognized as a result of 
the revised criteria, and our country ceased to qualify 
for graduation. It was not until the end of the twentieth 
century that Vanuatu’s eligibility for graduation from 
least developed country (LDC) status was raised again, 
after a decade of unquestionable economic progress in 
our island nation.

After the Committee for Development Policy 
and the Economic and Social Council reviewed our 
progress in 2012, the General Assembly, in December 
2013, decided that Vanuatu would graduate (see 
A/68/PV.59). At the same time, a grace period of four 
years was granted to enable a smooth transition to 
post-LDC life. Vanuatu’s graduation from LDC status 
is now scheduled to take place in December 2017. 
My Government accepts that as a positive signpost. 
However, the issue of vulnerability must be carefully 
addressed by the United Nations.

We are examining the LDC benefits we may 
eventually lose, with a view to negotiating the 
possibility of retaining certain concessions we deem 
important — if not vital — in sustaining economic 
development. Our impression of the graduation process 
is that our attention is being drawn to the question of 
smooth transition, while the real issue — the question 
of vulnerability, even during the post-graduation 
stage — is being circumvented. Our situation could best 
be described using the analogy of an aircraft. Vanuatu is 
in the descent phase, but the focus should not be on the 
smooth landing; rather, we must look to what happens 
after the smooth landing, as that is the real issue. Our 
vulnerabilities as a small island developing State (SIDS) 
remain undiminished, with lasting disadvantages and 
growing challenges regardless of our graduation from 
LDC status.

What is it, then, that the United Nations, which has 
been so generous in recognizing our vulnerabilities, 
can now offer us, as a SIDS, in support of our efforts 
to build resilience and productive capacity, and in 
support of our climate adaptation expenditure? Surely 
SIDS dealing with such issues deserve as much special 
attention as do LDCs. Is it unreasonable to expect 
that attention be translated into some form of special 
treatment for SIDS? We appreciate the focus of the 
United Nations on the importance of a smooth transition 
for graduating countries, but we also urge it not to be 
distracted from the real question, which is the way we 
SIDS will be treated after graduation.

Like other, similar economies, while Vanuatu has 
made some headway towards meeting the Millennium 

Development Goals (MDGs), it is still finding it difficult 
to achieve all of the goals by 2015. The reasons for that 
are numerous, but one of the significant difficulties is 
our narrow revenue base, coupled with a geographically 
dispersed population scattered over our 83 islands, 
which makes it a challenge for the Government to deliver 
basic services to all of its people. We are grateful that 
our development partners are always there to support 
us. Given the challenges that SIDS and LDCs face 
in financing development, I appeal to the developed 
countries to honour their commitment to increasing 
their aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national product, as 
agreed on in the Monterrey Consensus.

The current problem of terrorism threatens the 
security of States and the safety and well-being of 
innocent and vulnerable women and children. The 
kidnapping of innocent people, including some of 
our peacekeepers, is a threat to international security 
and peace. As a participant in various United Nations 
peacekeeping missions, I would like to express our 
gratitude to the United Nations and other countries for 
their assistance in negotiating the release of Fiji’s United 
Nations peacekeepers. The cooperation in this respect 
of members of the international community is a positive 
sign for the concept of our collective responsibility for 
international peace and security.

We salute the Secretary-General for his leadership 
as a vigorous campaigner for climate action and for 
convening this year’s Climate Summit. Leaders made 
many pledges and commitments during the Summit, 
and we look forward to seeing the rhetoric translated 
into urgent action. My delegation calls on the United 
Nations family to stand together to find ways to 
address climate-change issues. We are staring at a 
climate-change bubble, and the longer we delay action, 
the costlier it will be for our future generations. We 
must act now and fast to ensure that we steer clear of 
the current dangerous carbon-pollution trajectory.

The theme for the sixty-ninth session of the 
General Assembly, “Delivering on and implementing 
a transformative post-2015 development agenda”, is 
timely and relevant, particularly considering the ongoing 
efforts to arrive at a new post-2015 development agenda 
for all countries. I commend the excellent progress that 
has been made in this area, and I recognize that it is 
not easy to negotiate such goals, with so many member 
countries and the different groups they represent, all of 
which want their development agendas incorporated. I 
believe that our draft agenda does represent a consensus 
on the part of every United Nations Member and that it 
is capable of bringing development to a new level in all 
of our countries.

As a Pacific small island developing State, we 
are dealing with numerous development challenges 
that the United Nations system and the international 
community should address. I reiterate that climate 
change is a major global challenge for all of us. Some 
Pacific States are facing an existential threat, and we 
cannot deal with the issue of sustainable development 
alone if climate-change challenges are not addressed 
seriously by the international community. To that end, 
it is vital that climate change remain one of the major 
elements on the agenda of sustainable development 
goals (SDGs).

We note that this is a matter for considerable debate, 
owing to its cross-cutting nature. However, it is not a 
new issue, for the climate-change agenda is prominently 
featured in “The future we want” outcome document 
of the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development (resolution 66/288, annex). Our current 
efforts to address climate change are consistent with 
that, and it is another reason why our climate-change 
targets should be more ambitious. We strongly urge 
that the target of holding the increase in global average 
temperature below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels be 
included in the SDGs.

In addition to climate change, our support for the 
SDGs extends but is not limited to the inclusion of 
peace and effective institutions; ocean management; 
health and education; energy security and gender 
equality. We also concur with the emphasis on the 
means of implementation in the report of the Open 
Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable 
Development Goals (A/68/970) and urge the United 
Nations and the developed countries to continue to 
support developing countries, especially the SIDS 
and LDCs, in the areas of sustainable development 
financing and improving institutional capacity in their 
efforts to promote development.

Coincidentally, my country is at an important 
stage in its development planning process. Our current 
development planning framework will come to an 
end in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we are already 
consulting for the post-2015 era. The agenda and issues 
being discussed in the global arena will be translated 
into and merged with our development aspirations. 
I would like to take this opportunity to call on our 

development partners to support us by working in 
harmony and in a true spirit of partnership to help us to 
fulfil the dreams of our people, particularly our young 
and more vulnerable generation.

My Government acknowledges the synergy of the 
efforts being made by the United Nations and the British 
Commonwealth to uphold the international principles 
of peace and good governance, as well as in promoting 
stronger partnerships for inclusive development. I 
would like to ask the United Nations to allow the views 
expressed by the Commonwealth Heads of Government 
on the post-development agenda to be seen as additional 
contributions to that process.

My country has a history that evolved as the 
result of a long political struggle to achieve political 
independence, which finally came in 1980. But when 
most of us were young, it was governed by Britain 
and France, and we were stateless in our own country, 
neither French nor British citizens. For more than seven 
decades, we were exposed to foreign rule. We thus had 
to struggle to reconstruct our identity as a nation that 
could govern itself rather than be subjected to foreign 
rule. In 1981, after independence was achieved in 1980, 
I finally arrived here at the United Nations with our late 
former Prime Minister, Walter Lini. I clearly remember 
that cold autumn morning, when a small group, along 
with the United Nations protocol staff, gathered outside 
the entrance of this magnificent building to raise our 
flag for the first time at the United Nations. A new 
nation was born and was accepted by the United Nations 
family of nations.

As a freedom fighter and as the Prime Minister of 
the Republic of Vanuatu who took office less than six 
months ago, I proudly stand here today to thank the 
United Nations for the recognition and endorsement of 
our membership. But more importantly, here on this 
rostrum I want to underscore the unfinished business 
of the United Nations with regard to bringing closure 
to its work on decolonization. Part of my country’s 
sovereign territory is still being disputed by one of our 
former colonial Powers, which is also our dear friend 
and development partner.

I am delighted that the United Nations once again, 
through the work of the former United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, 
Mr. James Anaya, brought the matter to the twenty-
first session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. 
My country is delighted that in 2012 France responded 
to that action and expressed its openness to dialogue. 
We believe such openness is a necessary element for 
progress so that our indigenous peoples will be able to 
resume their rights to fully exercise their cultural and 
spiritual obligations on the two islands of Umaenupne/
Matthew and Leka/Hunter, and to revive the traditional 
routes of our ancestors in Tafea province.

My country’s political struggles have led to a strong 
position on decolonization. We share the dreams of 
those who are still longing for freedom so that they can 
achieve self-government and independence. As we near 
the midpoint of the United Nations Third International 
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, I want to 
echo those voices, from within our region and beyond, 
who should one day be able to stand on this podium as 
free and democratic nations.

My country acknowledges the message of 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, reminding the 
2014 Pacific regional seminar of the United Nations 
Decolonization Committee held in May this year 
that “good intentions will have to be translated into 
credible action to make the Third International Decade 
a success”. In that connection, my country supports 
the conclusions and recommendations contained in the 
report of the United Nations visiting mission to New 
Caledonia this year (A/AC.109/2014/20/Rev.1) and calls 
on the United Nations and the international community 
to pursue their efforts to provide support to the people of 
New Caledonia and the Government of France in their 
endeavour to implement a successful decolonization 
process under the Nouméa Accord.

At the nineteenth Melanesian Spearhead Group 
Leaders Summit in June 2013 in New Caledonia, the 
Group’s leaders renewed their commitment through 
a declaration to support the Front de libération 
nationale kanak socialiste (FLNKS) in their pursuit 
for full emancipation under the Nouméa Accord, 
through the provision of technical assistance and 
training programmes for the Kanak peoples to assist 
them in their struggle to fully exercise their right to 
self-determination and independence. While the New 
Caledonian people look forward to a political transition, 
I call upon the United Nations, through its regional 
agencies, to provide assistance to New Caledonia, in 
particular the FLNKS and the Kanak people, in specific 
areas of training to enable them to fully participate in 
the implementation of the Nouméa Accord. I appreciate 
the cooperative efforts of the Government of France for 
facilitating the implementation of the Nouméa Accord 

in a very mature and responsible manner. Those efforts 
must not be derailed.

I cannot close this section of my speech without 
paying tribute to the late Mr. John Ondawame, a 
freedom fighter from West Papua, who passed away 
last month while in exile in my country. He was laid 
to rest in my country as a hero who had fought for 
the rights to self-determination for the people of West 
Papua. He and other martyrs had a dream that one 
day the United Nations and all nations advocating and 
promoting democratic principles would hear their cries 
and deliver on the promise of a self-determined future. 
At his funeral service, I stated that his struggle for 
freedom and justice would continue to be our struggle 
until colonialism is eradicated.

There are many other heroes in many countries 
that are still voiceless and are suffering in silence, 
either owing to unilateral policy choices, or because 
of ignorance on the part of the multilateral system. 
My country is encouraged by the onset of flexibility 
exercised by the United States of America towards the 
Cuban people. I believe that the willingness for dialogue 
and consideration is a responsible gesture that will 
slowly open the door for a better future for all Cubans. 
We must, as individual countries, be ready to be a voice 
for the voiceless. Bigger and richer countries must be 
the burden-bearers for smaller nations. In doing so, we 
demonstrate our willingness to live as a village, a world 
community of friends and not aggressors. I want to 
stress that the only way to address that issue is through 
dialogue and unity. It is our moral responsibility not to 
fail those who have been victims of past ignorance.

My country and many others have repeatedly raised 
these concerns on this same podium for many years, 
because we subscribe to them as inalienable human 
rights. The concerns of vulnerability, sustainable 
development, fisheries, job creation, human rights 
and many others are reflected in the Small Island 
Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action 
(Samoa Pathway) outcome document (A/CONF.223/3, 
annex). My country fully endorses the Samoa Pathway 
document as a guide that is to be used to navigate 
through our development challenges.

The Samoa Pathway, built on the Barbados 
Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy 
for Implementation, has charted a decisive course 
going forward. The United Nations system and the 
international community are urged to ensure that it is 
integrated into a transformative post-2015 development 
framework and that we close the implementation gaps 
of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius 
Strategy.

Let me take this opportunity to thank the 
Government and the people of Samoa for ably hosting 
the third International Conference on Small Island 
Developing States held in Apia.

I deeply appreciate the opportunity to present my 
views to this important forum. I hope that the statements 
and the deliberations that we make today will translate 
into concrete actions leading to a better future for all 
our peoples. Long live our aspirations to create lasting 
peace and a better world for our people! May God bless 
the United Nations!
"
4930,69,2014,PNG,"Allow me, on 
behalf of the Government of Papua New Guinea, to 
congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President 
of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. 
Papua New Guinea supports his leadership as we work 
with him on the ambitious theme of “Delivering on and 
implementing a transformative post-2015 development 
agenda”. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute 
to Ambassador John Ashe for his strong leadership 
in setting the stage for enhancing the sustainable 
development agenda of Member States, especially 
of small island developing States (SIDS). We also 
commend the Secretary-General for his leadership and 
untiring commitment to advancing the cause of global 
peace and security to enhance the multidimensional 
global development agenda.

It has been a long and sometimes hard road for the 
people of Fiji over the past eight years. We therefore 
warmly congratulate the people of Fiji for their return 
to constitutional and democratic rule following their 
general elections this year. We welcome the return of 
Fiji to the Commonwealth and to the Pacific Islands 
Forum. In wishing the people of Fiji well, Papua New 
Guinea will continue to stand ready to assist them, as 
it has done in the past, along with other major Pacific 
partners, in areas where such assistance can be effective 
as Fiji embarks on its new path forward.

The recent third International Conference on Small 
Island Developing States, held in Samoa, was a great 
success. We commend the adoption of the Small Island 
Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action/
Samoa Pathway, which reiterated the sustainable 
development priorities of SIDS, which has been 
affirmed by the international community.

But the impacts of climate change continue to pose 
a serious challenge to the sustainable development 
of SIDS. The full range of damaging events — such 
as rising sea levels, coastal erosion, salinization of 
the fresh water table, prolonged and severe droughts, 
flooding and other extreme weather and loss of and 
damage to vital infrastructure — remains a constant 
concern for SIDS. Many SIDS, especially in the Pacific, 
have reached a tipping point. While the right thing for 
us to do is to respond to the challenges by working 
smarter and harder to improve the livelihoods of people 
at risk, the bigger and advanced countries of the world 
must not only do likewise; they must also redouble their 
efforts in partnering with us.

As part of our support to Pacific SIDS, Papua 
New Guinea has launched the Pacific Development 
Assistance Programme, which is aimed at assisting 
Pacific SIDS in critical areas of development such as 
education, health, capacity-building, climate change 
and the reconstruction of important infrastructure 
after natural disasters. We reiterate our call on the 
international community, including the United Nations, 
to work together with SIDS in the spirit of genuine and 
durable partnership.

We commend the Secretary-General for convening 
the successful Climate Summit last week. In 
supporting the outcomes, we must build on the political 
momentum generated as we move towards Lima this 
year and, importantly, towards Paris in 2015, where 
the international community must conclude a legally 
binding agreement in order for us to collectively 
address the adverse impacts of climate change.

The international community stands at an 
important crossroads. The imminent deadline of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the 
transition to the post-2015 development agenda have 
rightly become the centre stage of the global agenda. 
We support a people-centered and transformative 
post-2015 development agenda underpinned by global 
partnerships that support national ownership of 
sustainable development.

We welcome the adoption by the General Assembly, 
by resolution 68/309, of the report of the Open Working 
Group on Sustainable Development Goals (A/68/970), 

which recommended 17 goals. We must chart a realistic 
path, with goals that are attainable given the necessary 
means of implementation. We also commend the work 
of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on 
Sustainable Development Financing, which is critical 
to the successful implementation of the post-2015 
development agenda.

In that respect, the Pacific island developing States 
note with appreciation the inclusion of the important 
proposed stand-alone goals on oceans and seas, 
sustainable energy and climate change. Along with 
the other proposed goals, those goals should form the 
basis for the intergovernmental negotiations that are to 
take place. Papua New Guinea will participate in those 
negotiations.

My Government remains fully committed to those 
efforts because we have experienced the galvanizing 
impact of the MDGs, which has helped us take national 
ownership and develop a home-grown sustainable 
development paradigm. While my country’s MDG 
scorecard remains a work in progress, my Government 
has undertaken various initiatives to redress the 
situation. We have retailored the MDGs to our national 
priorities, with 88 indicators connecting them to our 
national development plans.

A recent report by the United Nations country 
office on progress to achieve the MDGs was optimistic 
and positive. The report found that Papua New Guinea 
had made important strides towards achieving the 
MDGs, especially since the general elections in 2012. 
They include the bold decision to run budget deficits 
until 2017, which, the report notes, has enabled the 
nation to invest in essential areas.

My Government is implementing a policy of free 
education for all primary-school children, resulting 
in an increase in school enrolments by as much as 
80 per cent in some areas. We now have around 
2 million children in schools. In the health sector, 
we are witnessing a reduction of rates in early child 
and maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other 
communicable diseases. More mothers and children 
are getting access to health care as a result of our free 
health-care policy. Our infrastructure development 
programme is improving Papua New Guinea’s business 
environment and creating opportunities for our people 
to participate meaningfully in national development.

A key cornerstone of our development road map 
is a people-centred focus on population management 
and stabilization. It entails empowering individuals to 
take leadership and full responsibility to improve their 
livelihoods through appropriate measures. Our economy 
has grown over the last decade at an average rate of 6 to 
8 per cent per annum, and is projected to reach 20 per 
cent in 2015. That growth is transforming our country, 
especially with revenue from the completion of our first 
liquefied natural gas project and its exports.

This is a new economic and development age for 
our economy. The unprecedented and transformative 
economic progress will coincide with the pursuit of 
the post-2015 development agenda. We are clearly 
focused on actively participating in the process and in 
its implementation at the national and regional levels. 
Our Government is fully committed to ensuring that we 
manage the transformation carefully and effectively. 
Our challenge is to ensure that the growth delivers the 
maximum benefit to our citizens.

Recently, our Government launched a $100 million 
initiative with our leading national bank, the Bank of 
the South Pacific, to make home loans more affordable 
for our citizens. We are also facilitating financial 
inclusion services for our people. We are grateful to our 
development partners, including the United Nations, 
Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China 
and the European Union. My Government has helped 
with the capital for the first national women’s bank and 
for microcredit schemes to help our people at the grass-
roots level become owners and drivers of their future 
well-being. In addition, we are giving priority to small 
and medium enterprises to drive national development.

Furthermore, my Government is developing a 
national statistics development strategy to provide a road 
map for Papua New Guinea to continually improve and 
update the collection and management of its statistical 
information in order to improve decision-making. 
That includes embarking on a national biometric 
identification card system to record and maintain the 
population information of our citizens.

Despite our economic growth, social issues remain 
a challenge. My Government values our women and 
girls, who constitute half of our population, as equal 
development partners. We are making sure that gender 
empowerment and equality continue to be a cornerstone 
of our responsible sustainable development. We 
therefore support the work of UN-Women.

I am pleased to inform the Assembly that my 
Government has committed record funding of 

$10 million this year for various initiatives, including 
partnering with the United Nations Population Fund 
to make available 40,000 contraceptive implants as 
important intervention measures for the health of our 
women and girls of child-bearing age. That will be 
scaled up to $20 million by 2015. My Government, 
in partnership with our development partners, is also 
investing in upgrading vital midwifery skills, along 
with enhancing our health referral systems to address 
complicated pregnancies. As a member of the Executive 
Board of UNICEF, we will promote and participate in 
the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.

My Government welcomes and pledges our support 
for the President’s timely agenda for strengthening 
international peace and security. As a responsible 
Member of the United Nations, we are committed 
to fostering global peace and security. As such, my 
country is deploying a modest level of troops to the 
United Nations peacekeeping missions in the Sudan 
and South Sudan. As our capacity grows, we intend to 
contribute more.

We are concerned about the increasing conflicts 
and tensions in many parts of the world, particularly 
those involving non-State actors. An unacceptable 
heavy toll of destruction is exacted upon millions of 
innocent children, women and men, often uprooted 
from their homes, dislocated and downtrodden and 
their dignity humiliated. We must rebuke and unite 
against the rising tide of intolerance, bigotry and hatred 
under various banners.

We again condemn terrorism in all its 
manifestations. We join the international community 
to combat that global threat. Our support for Security 
Council resolution 2178 (2014) against terrorism, which 
was recently adopted, is a reaffirmation that inhuman 
atrocities committed cannot and should not be condoned 
by the international community. Those responsible for 
such inhuman atrocities must be held accountable.

We are also concerned by the rising tensions 
between and within certain countries and the 
re-emergence of the ugly head of another potential 
arms race. The world does not need that; rather, we 
must recommit our efforts for global disarmament that 
supports a transformative development agenda that 
brings long-lasting improvement in the livelihoods of 
people everywhere.

The Ebola crisis is a concern that is not limited just 
to West Africa. It is an international crisis, one which 
we, the international community, must address together 
as we have done with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
and HIV/AIDS. Those diseases and pandemics do 
not recognize national sovereign borders. Like other 
countries, Papua New Guinea has taken appropriate 
measures to address the potential spread of Ebola.

We note with concern that progress in the Third 
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism 
has been slow. We need to strengthen efforts to 
complete that process. Papua New Guinea urges the 
implementation of the report and conclusions of the 
United Nations visiting mission to New Caledonia this 
year, and thereby calls on the United Nations and the 
international community, particularly the administering 
Power, to support the process of decolonization under 
the Noumea Accord. The Summit of the Melanesian 
Spearhead Group in June 2013 supported through 
a declaration the efforts of the Front de libération 
nationale kanak et socialiste in New Caledonia.


Papua New Guinea strongly believes that the 
international community is a better, more secure and 
harmonious place because of the United Nations. 
Certainly there are areas in the United Nations where 
reform is required, as is the case with any large 
organization. We need to recommit ourselves to the 
areas where the Organization has been successful, and 
in other areas we need to build adequate systems. Our 
ultimate objective must be to promote a more effective, 
more accountable, more responsive and more caring 
United Nations — a United Nations capable of meeting 
the challenges of the twenty-first century.

Papua New Guinea therefore shares the President’s 
intention to further reform, rejuvenate and strengthen 
the Security Council to allow for equitable geographic 
representation. Regrettably, that important organ does 
not reflect today’s geopolitical realities. We again join 
many other Member States in calling for the reform of 
the Security Council in both categories of membership.

At this time next year we will be celebrating 
40 years of nation-building in Papua New Guinea, just 
as the United Natons commemorates its seventieth 
anniversary. We continue to be a proud, united country 
of many diverse cultures and peoples speaking more 
than 800 languages. We are also rapidly transforming 

our traditional way of life to that of a modern country 
in just one generation.

In conclusion, I recommit my country to the ideals 
of the Charter of the United Nations and pledge to work 
closely with all other Member States to collaborate on 
solutions to the many issues we all face as humankind.
"
5002,69,2014,NZL,"It is an honour to 
address the General Assembly today on behalf of the 
Prime Minister and Government of New Zealand. Our 
general election took place in the past week. Our Prime 
Minister, the Right Honourable John Key, is engaged in 
forming a Government, and that is why he is unable to 
be in New York today.

I want to begin by acknowledging the success of 
the recent third International Conference on Small 
Island Developing States, held in Samoa. The success 
of the Conference was the result of the extraordinary 
work Samoa put into preparing for the Conference and 
the ownership of the agenda that was demonstrated by 
the small island developing States (SIDS). While it is 
undoubtedly true that small island developing States 
have placed great value on the opportunity to talk, it 
is also true that there was an undertone of frustration, 
born of the fact that too often in the past talk has not 
been followed by action. I strongly identify with that 
view. The multilateral world is awash with talk of plans 
and strategies and funds, while out there in the real 
world of small island developing States, not enough is 
happening on the ground. My country, New Zealand, is 
intent on avoiding that shortcoming, especially in our 
own region, the Pacific.

Renewable energy featured strongly in the SIDS 
Conference agenda, as it had at the Secretary-General’s 
2014 Climate Summit in the past week. Pacific nations 
spend 10 per cent of their gross domestic product and up 
to 30 per cent of their entire import bills on importing 
diesel fuel for electricity generation. Sustainable 
economic development therefore simply cannot happen 
in our region without renewable energy.

Significant progress is being achieved, especially 
since the Pacific Energy Summit 2013 that we co-hosted 
with the European Union in Auckland in March 2013, 
at which $635 million in funding was committed for 
over 50 projects. The Tokelau Islands have moved from 
100 per cent dependence on fossil fuels to 93 per cent 
renewable. During the SIDS Conference itself, we 
opened a 2.2-megawatt plant, a solar array in Samoa. 
A year earlier we opened a 1.2-megawatt plant in 
Tonga. Next month, we will open a 1-megawatt array in 
Rarotonga. And in the next 12 months, all of the outer 
islands of Tuvalu and all but one of the outer Cook 
Islands will be close to 100 per cent renewable. 

We are making real progress towards converting 
our Pacific neighbourhood to renewable energy, 
bringing significant environmental benefits and 
greatly enhancing prospects for sustainable economic 
development. My country has committed over 
$100 million to that process. We are not waiting for a 
new multilateral agreement or a new green fund. We 
are simply getting ahead with robust partnerships and 
making it happen.

Another key topic at the SIDS Conference was 
sustainable fisheries. For our region, that is critically 
important. The biggest economic asset in the Pacific 
is its fisheries. In the past year, over $3.3 billion worth 
of tuna was harvested from Pacific waters, yet only 
14 per cent of that value, about $460 million, made 
its way back to Pacific nations. New Zealand has 
committed over $70 million over the next five years 
to advance a comprehensive approach that includes 
enhanced surveillance, training of monitors, training 
in commercial fishing practices, research and science 
initiatives and improving management practices. Our 
objective is to see the owners of the Pacific tuna resource 
receive a significantly greater share of the value of that 
resource, and to ensure that it is sustainably managed 
for the future.

A key message from the SIDS Conference is the need 
to share experiences and skills among the SIDS regions. 
That is starting to happen. Fisheries management is a 
prime candidate for greater cooperation. We have also 
commenced a process of interregional cooperation in 
renewable energy by supporting the development of 
geothermal energy in the Caribbean and Africa.

While small island developing States are showing 
real leadership in addressing climate change and 
shifting to renewable energy, those issues require action 
on a global scale. We therefore commend the Secretary-
General for convening the Climate Summit here in 
New York last week. We are participating actively in 
those negotiations and hope they will pave the way for 
a successful conclusion in Paris next year. We have 
made an initial commitment to the Green Climate 
Fund to show our support for the global effort, but we 
will unashamedly continue to prioritize making real 
progress with real projects in our own region, which 
will continue to consume the bulk of our resources.

The other major event that has recently taken place 
in the Pacific is the election in Fiji. We congratulate the 
Prime Minister, his party and the people of Fiji on their 
successful return to democratic rule. Fiji’s successful 
elections are hugely important for the region. I am 
delighted that following the preliminary report of the 
multinational observers group, both the Pacific Islands 
Forum and the Commonwealth have commenced the 
process of lifting Fiji’s suspension. We look forward to 
rebuilding and strengthening the connections between 
us. Neither New Zealand nor Fiji can contemplate a 
future that does not entail close and continuing links 
with the other. We also welcomed the safe return of the 
Fiji peacekeepers who were held hostage in the Golan 
Heights. That incident again underlined the great 
challenges and the dangers faced by United Nations 
peacekeepers and the responsibilities we all have to 
ensure the safety and security of peacekeeping and 
other United Nations personnel.

It is as well that we are able to note some bright 
spots for our region, because the situation in other parts 
of the world does look bleak. 

What happened over the past few months in 
Gaza was an affront to humanity. No good was done 
for the cause of Palestine by Hamas firing rockets 
indiscriminately into Israel. No good was done for peace 
in the Middle East by Israel pounding Gaza with such 
intensity and at such cost of civilian lives. We welcome 
the ceasefire that was agreed after so many false starts 
and are thankful that so far it endures. We call on all 
sides not only to keep the guns and rockets silent but to 
refrain from actions that may destabilize what can only 
be described as an uneasy peace. In that connection, we 
express our profound regret at Israel’s appropriation of 
400 hectares of privately owned Palestinian land near 
Bethlehem for settlements. That act itself is profoundly 
unhelpful.

The problems of the Middle East are deep and 
difficult. They go back to the earliest days of the 
Organization and beyond. But what happened over 
the past months in and in relation to Gaza was a 
modern failure — a failure of leadership, of purpose 
and of vision. We urge the leaders of Israel and of 
Palestine, both West Bank and Gaza, to live up to their 
responsibilities to their peoples and to their positions.

In Syria and Iraq, we see the truly frightening 
consequences when leadership, both internally and 
in the Security Council, has failed. Syria has been a 
weeping sore for over three years. Thousands of Syrians 
have died, millions have become refugees and all 
Syrian people have suffered terribly from the multiple 
conflicts engulfing the country. And now the tragedy 
of Syria has spilled over into Iraq, which was already 
wrestling with its own deep-seated problems. Many 
actors, in both the recent past and over a longer time 
frame, have had a hand in contributing to the situation 
we now confront, but now it is time for action.

We need to find a way to contain the madness that 
is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, to address 
the humanitarian tragedy and to help the people of Syria 
and Iraq craft a better future. By any objective standard, 


that is a situation that cries out for Security Council 
attention, and that is true of both sides of the border. 
We need the Council members and the Governments 
concerned to move past the ideological stalemate that 
has kept the Council largely impotent for the past three 
years. The challenge we all face in Syria and Iraq is 
unlike any the United Nations has faced before. The 
political circumstances in which it is being played out 
are about as bad as they get. Yet somehow we must find 
a way of coming together to defeat that shared problem.

Paralysis has also prevailed in the Security Council 
over Ukraine. The Council has been essentially 
a bystander as one of its permanent members has 
undermined the integrity of another Member State. We 
recognize the difficulties of managing ethnic tensions 
that straddle borders and the risks of local fires being 
stoked into wider national and international crises. But 
with the strong shared histories of cooperation and 
achievement between Russia and Ukraine, there is no 
excuse for leaders allowing matters to unravel as they 
have, to the point where international peace and security 
may be at risk. Already hundreds of innocent civilians 
on Flight MH-17 lost their lives through an associated 
mistake and miscalculation. We welcome the ceasefire 
agreed earlier this month, which has held, for the most 
part. We call on all involved to step back, think about 
what is at stake and start rebuilding the trust essential 
to finding a lasting solution.

Events in the Middle East and Ukraine have 
dominated the headlines in recent months and have 
diverted attention from the serious situations that 
continue to play out in Africa, particularly in Libya, 
Mali, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, 
Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 
United Nations is directly involved in those crises, 
and they continue to challenge the capacity of the 
Organization and of the African Union to respond 
to the sheer scale of human suffering and to the 
continuing need for external assistance to restore and 
keep the peace, keep civilian populations safe and 
deliver humanitarian assistance. Those issues, no less 
than those in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, 
will continue to require constant attention from the 
Security Council and the coordinated efforts of the 
broader United Nations family. They show that for all 
its failings and structural inequalities, the Council still 
has a vital role to play in maintaining international 
peace and security.

But there is one lesson that we must learn from 
all those recent crises — the United Nations must 
fundamentally improve its performance in preventing 
conflict. Once fighting is in full spate, the options for 
peace disappear. Prevention is critical, not just in new 
conflicts, but also in the cases on the agenda where 
conflict has been frozen or where peacebuilding has 
not really taken hold.

We are deeply troubled by the unprecedented scale 
of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We recognize 
the huge challenges it poses to the economies and 
the political and security cohesion in the region. We 
have contributed and will continue to contribute to the 
humanitarian work under way, and on the formation of 
a new Government, we will look at further practical 
steps to support the international effort.

In 18 days’ time, the United Nations membership 
will decide who will be on the Security Council for the 
next two-year term. New Zealand has been a candidate 
for that position since 2004. It has been 20 years since 
we were last on the Council. It has been a long and 
demanding campaign, and it will continue right up to 
the elections on 16 October. With tough competitors, 
such as our good friends Spain and Turkey, that has to 
be the case. The campaign has been a great opportunity 
for us to engage with nations around the world. We 
greatly value the new relationships we have forged 
and the enhanced character of existing relationships. 
Whatever the outcome, we are determined to maintain 
them. 

In the past, New Zealand has demonstrated that as 
a member of the Council it acts strongly, effectively and 
independently. It champions the rights of small States 
and for the voices of all to be heard. In short, as my 
Prime Minister said from this rostrum last year, there 
is no point in joining the Council simply to make up the 
numbers. Sometimes one has to speak up and shine a 
light on what is going on, or not going on, even when it 
is embarassing or inconvenient to others to do so.

Above all, I can assure the Assembly that if we 
are elected, New Zealand will be a credible, positive 
influence on the Security Council. At our core, New 
Zealand is an optimistic country and New Zealanders 
are an optimistic people. We believe that things can be 
better than they are and are prepared, as a people, to 
work hard to achieve that. Despite the many challenges 
on the international agenda, my hope is that the 
membership of the United Nations will give us an 

opportunity to prove that by serving on the Security 
Council from next year.
"
5006,69,2014,AUS,"In what can seem to be 
darkening times, I want to begin with a message of 
hope. Amid all our problems, the murderous rage of 
the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Syria and 
Iraq, Russian aggression in Ukraine, the spread of 
Ebola in West Africa and the stubborn sluggishness of 
many economies, let me start with a small but telling 
illustration of nations working together to serve our 
common humanity. Last March, at the height of the 
search for the missing Flight MH-70, I went to the Pearce 
airbase in Western Australia to thank all the aviators 
involved. There were personnel from Australia, New 
Zealand, Malaysia and the United States — countries 
that are accustomed to working together. There were 
also personnel from China, Japan and Korea — countries 
whose relations sometimes labour under the weight of 
historical grievances.


On that occasion, however, the tragedy and a 
daunting challenge drew out the best in everyone. 
The Organization was founded on the principle that 
we should work together for the common good and 
that, over time, talking together and working together 
will improve our capacity for living together. Like 
any institution, the United Nations is an imperfect 
instrument. Still, it is better than “might is right”, and 
it gives good arguments the best chance to prevail.

Despite faults and failures, the United Nations 
has worked for peace and progress for nearly 70 years. 
Australia has been proud to play its part, starting in 
1946, when we held the first presidency of the Security 
Council and helped to draft the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. At the heart of the Organization is the 
principle that we should act towards others as we would 
have them act towards us. For almost seven decades, 
Australia has believed in the potential of the United 
Nations and supported its work. Keeping commitments, 
valuing human life, protecting property and extending 
freedom are universal aspirations, not only Australian 
ones.

Since 1947, we have provided more than 65,000 
personnel to more than 50 multilateral peace and 
security operations. We are not a country accustomed to 
turning back, once we have put our hand to the plough. 
We have had Blue Beret personnel in the Middle East 
since 1956 and in Cyprus since 1964. When leadership 
is needed, we step up, as we did in Bougainville, 
in Timor-Leste and in Solomon Islands. In Korea, 
Cambodia, Kuwait and Afghanistan and in Somalia, 
Sierra Leone and other troubled places, Australians 
have lent a hand under the United Nations banner. We 
have only 21 personnel in South Sudan now but have 
conducted an airlift of equipment that has supported a 
much larger force.

With just 24 million people, Australia is a relatively 
small country, but we have the world’s twelfth- 
largest economy, with global interests and with some 
global reach. We are strong enough to be useful but 
pragmatic enough to know our limits. Under successive 
Governments, for more than 100 years, Australia’s 
determination has been to advance our interests, 
to protect our citizens and to uphold our values. 
We have never believed that we can save the world 
single-handedly, nor have we shrunk from shouldering 
our responsibilities. After the 2004 East Asian tsunami, 
we committed $1 billion to Indonesia. We were one of 
the first countries to arrive with help in Japan after the 
2011 earthquake and in the Philippines after the 2013 
typhoon.

To date, we have pledged $8 million towards 
combating the Ebola outbreak, and dozens of Australian 
health professionals are working with international 
agencies in the region. To us, this is all part of being a 
good global citizen. Last July, we were pleased to sponsor 
Security Council resolution 2166 (2014) and to work 
with the Dutch and the Malaysians to investigate the 
crash site and recover our dead, after Malaysia Airlines 
Flight MH-17 was shot down by Russian-backed rebels 
over eastern Ukraine. We are grateful for the help that 
Ukraine gave us, and are naturally sympathetic to a 
country struggling to preserve its independence and 
territorial integrity against a bully. With the Dutch and 
the Malaysians, we will do everything we can to ensure 
that the investigation is not undermined, and that the 
crime is not covered up, because that is our duty to the 
38 Australians murdered in this atrocity.

Right now, an Australian force has been deployed 
to the Middle East, so that we can join a coalition 
seeking to disrupt and degrade the Islamic State of 
Iraq and the Levant terrorist movement at the request 
of the Iraqi Government. One of our prime ministers 
once talked about our country’s great objective, “our 
light on the hill,” as he put it, namely, to work for the 
betterment of mankind, not just at home, but wherever 
we can lend a helping hand. To build a better world, 
we need to respond sensibly to the problems before us, 
whether through bodies such as the United Nations, 
or in coalitions with like-minded countries. We also 
need to work purposefully to create stronger and more 
resilient people and communities. A stronger economy 
will not solve every problem, but it will make almost 
every problem easier to tackle. Richer people are not 
necessarily better people, but the problems of plenty 
are invariably easier to deal with than those of want.

As this year’s Chair of the Group of Twenty (G-
20), Australia is determined to promote private-sector-
led growth: growth, because that is the best way 
to generate jobs and improve everyone’s quality of 
life; private-sector-led, because profitable, private 
businesses are the best source of real, sustainable 
wealth. Freer trade, more investment in infrastructure, 
a modern and fair international tax system, stronger 
global economic institutions and a more resilient 
financial sector are all parts of our G-20 agenda to 
strengthen the world economy.


Rather than preaching, we are trying to lead by 
example. Australia has abolished the carbon tax and 
the mining tax, and we have provided environmental 
approvals for $800 billion worth of new projects. We 
have also begun the task of eliminating our budget 
deficit within four years. We have finalized a series of 
trade deals, because every time a country trades with 
another, wealth increases, and when wealth increases, 
countries grow stronger. Our G-20 goal is to boost 
output by an extra 2 per cent over the next five years 
to create millions of jobs and to generate trillions in 
wealth right around the world.

Likewise, the post-2015 development agenda 
should also focus on economic growth, because growth 
makes every other social goal, even tackling climate 
change, easier to accomplish. To people who do not 
know where their next meal is coming from, talk of 
economic growth can seem ignorant or indulgent. But 
“economic growth” is really just economists’ shorthand 
for more jobs, higher pay, new industries and the better 
life that only greater wealth can provide. Economic 
growth might seem a mundane vision, but it allows 
millions more people to create their own vision of how 
their lives can be better.

To anyone who doubts that stronger economic 
growth can be achieved, I say, “Look at the countries 
of East Asia”. In scarcely two generations, the rise 
of Asia has driven the greatest social and economic 
transformation in history. People live longer, they are 
better educated, wealthier and, yes, they enjoy a level 
of freedom and stability that their parents could only 
dream of. In Japan, Korea and now China, in India and 
increasingly in Indonesia, many hundreds of millions 
of people have been lifted from poverty to the middle 
class. Almost certainly, that is the greatest and fastest 
advance in human welfare of all time.

While all Governments, Australia’s included, could 
always be better, smarter and more compassionate, 
no one should be blind to the great progress that has 
occurred. We live in the most remarkable age in human 
history. For all the work that remains to be done, we 
have seen more change for the better than at any other 
time.

As the General Assembly session meets with 
such pressing issues before it, our challenge — as 
always — is to realize our best hopes and to be our best 
selves. Australians have two defining characteristics: 
we believe in a “fair go”, because innate decency 
demands that every person have a chance to contribute. 
We also believe in “having a go”, because rolling up 
your sleeves will always produce a better result than 
standing on the sidelines complaining. That readiness 
to make an effort for a good cause is why Australia 
feels so comfortable in this body and is so ready to 
contribute to its work. We should put no limits on what 
we can achieve, especially when we work together, trust 
people and are faithful to our deepest values.

Every country counts. Every argument must be 
weighed. Every person has equal rights and dignity. 
Every person deserves respect. All people are entitled 
to make their own choices — provided they do not 
infringe on the rights of others. Those are the principles 
that this Organization embodies and on which the 
future of humanity rests.
"
5071,66,2011,AUS,"Since we last gathered in 
this great Assembly one year ago, we have witnessed 
developments of historic dimensions. There has been 
democratic protest and democratic reform across the 
Arab world, as we discovered afresh that freedom is 
the right of all, not just of the few. Also, a global 
economic crisis is rolling on, as we enter a new and 
dangerous period that threatens the jobs and 
livelihoods of working people everywhere. 
 And while rarely making the front pages, the 
other great global challenges that have been with us 
now for too many years continue their almost 
alarmingly silent advance — challenges of grinding 
poverty, environmental degradation, the continued 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the enhancement of 
human rights, all of which compete for attention on an 
already crowded international agenda. 
 Our global institutions are struggling to 
comprehend, let alone effectively respond to, this vast 
array of challenges that now confront us — challenges 
that arise as the inevitable consequence of what we 
now simply call globalization. Put simply, the dilemma 
is this: the challenges we face are increasingly global 
while the institutions at our disposal are still primarily 
national. Or put more crudely, for those engaged in 
democratic politics, the answers may lie abroad, but all 
the votes lie at home. 
 Three years ago, when I first spoke at this 
podium, I spoke of the storm clouds gathering across 
the global economy. It seemed as if we were in free fall 
as we all stared into the abyss, with the very real 
possibility of a second global depression in a century. 
Through coordinated intervention in 2009, we broke 
the fall. Yet three years on, the crisis in the global 
economy continues, still with a capacity to engulf us 
all. Recovery is stalling. Unemployment is rising. 
Confidence is waning. There are growing concerns 
over sovereign debt levels, and there are concerns also 
over the national and international political will to deal 
with these challenges. 
 This week, the International Monetary Fund 
issued a stark warning for the global economy, 
highlighting that we have entered a new and dangerous 
phase. So what then is to be done?  
 First, reforms to the financial system should be 
implemented and taxpayers should no longer be asked 
to bail out the irresponsible behaviour of particular 
financial institutions. Secondly, all major economies 
need to find a credible path back to surplus over time, 
consistent with the Group of Twenty’s Framework for 
Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth. Thirdly, we 
  
 
11-51179 2 
 
must prevent a further outbreak of protectionism and 
we must conclude Doha, as history will condemn us if 
we repeat the job-destroying protectionism of the 
1930s that transformed a financial crisis into a full-
blown depression. 
 Fourthly, for international trade to grow and 
Chinese domestic demand to make a greater 
contribution to growth in economies around the world, 
we must also see currency reform, particularly with the 
appreciation of the Chinese yuan. And finally, we must 
with clarity of leadership and resolution of purpose 
define and deliver a range of other new innovative 
drivers of global growth. These include innovative 
public-private financing for the new infrastructure 
revolution needed for power, water, agriculture, 
transport and communications. The jobs potential for 
the green energy revolution must be fully harvested by 
carbon pricing, and women and youth must participate 
fully in the economies of the developed and the 
developing world.  
 These are not just useful social policies. These 
are not just useful environmental policies. They are 
now necessary economic policies to generate the next 
missing increment of global economic growth. What is 
required, therefore, is global and national political 
leadership capable of looking beyond the next electoral 
cycle — to look to the long term over the short term, to 
look to the strategic rather than the tactical, and to look 
to the necessary over the urgent. 
 Over the course of the last decade, we have seen 
an acceleration of the shift of economic power to Asia 
marking Asia’s re-emergence as the centre of global 
economic gravity after an interruption of more than 
200 years. In the year 2000, China was a mere 3.7 per 
cent of global GDP and India was less than half that. 
By 2030, they will account for more than 20 per cent 
of global GDP, and that will rise further. Asian 
countries held 16.6 per cent of global foreign exchange 
reserves in 2001. Now they hold 39 per cent.  
 Therefore, what happens in Asia is now of 
fundamental relevance to the world, not just to the 
region itself. Asian economic growth has been 
overwhelmingly good for the global economy.  
 But Asia has also seen an exponential increase in 
military expenditure. Over the last 20 years military 
expenditure in East Asia grew by nearly 150 per cent. 
During the same period the United States’ military 
expenditure grew by 36 per cent. Asia, with its many 
unresolved territorial disputes and military tensions, 
has become the new global arms bazaar. 
 One of the big spenders, despite the poverty 
afflicting its population, is North Korea. North Korea’s 
nuclear weapons programme and its long-range missile 
programme represent a direct threat to the security of 
our region, including Australia. 
 To deal adequately with those and other security 
challenges in Asia, we need strong regional 
institutional architecture, as a complement to the 
United Nations, to help build transparency, cooperation 
and, in time, a sense of common security in our region. 
 For that reason, Australia has promoted the 
concept of an Asia-Pacific community. Collectively, 
regional countries now have an opportunity to realize 
the idea of such a community through the expanded 
East Asia Summit (EAS), which for the first time this 
year will include the Presidents of the United States 
and of the Russian Federation. Over time, a stronger 
EAS can promote the type of rules-based order 
regionally for which the United Nations strives 
globally. This task is critical to avoid damaging 
strategic miscalculation in the Asia-Pacific region, 
which would also undermine global economic growth.  
 I say again: what happens in Asia now matters 
not just for Asia, itself, but for the world. 
 In Australia’s more immediate region in the South 
Pacific, we are bound together by the common bonds 
of democracy and the responsibility we all have to 
develop those economies and protect their natural 
environment. 
 We thank the Secretary-General for his visit to 
the Pacific Islands Forum — the first ever by a United 
Nations Secretary-General. His commitment to our 
region is an important signal of the international 
community’s interests in the Pacific’s prosperity, its 
sustainability and its democracy. 
 Global events since the last session of the 
General Assembly have highlighted that the human cry 
for freedom and for democracy is both indivisible and 
universal. Australia stands with the rest of the 
international community in applauding the courage of 
those citizens seeking what is naturally theirs in 
Tunisia, in Egypt, in Libya, and now in Syria. 
 In Egypt, we are now supporting improved dry 
land farming and assistance with urban employment 
 
 
3 11-51179 
 
programmes as Egypt moves to critical parliamentary 
and presidential elections. In Tunisia, we are providing 
agricultural and electoral assistance. In Libya, 
Australia was among the first to campaign 
internationally for a no-fly zone to protect civilians at a 
time when Al-Qadhafi seemed destined for victory. We 
are proud of the fact that since the Libya conflict 
began, Australia stands across the world as the third 
largest humanitarian donor to the long-suffering people 
of Libya. We also stand ready to assist with institution-
building in the new Libya of the future. 
 What challenges us now is the ongoing brutality 
in Syria. The Syrian regime should heed the lessons of 
Libya. We call on Bashar Al-Assad to step down now, 
for political reform to begin now, and for the 
international community to intensify its pressure on 
Damascus to respond to the voices of the Syrian people 
demanding their legitimate freedom. 
 Twelve months ago, we had no expectation of 
change in Egypt, Tunisia or Libya. But we did hope to 
see progress in the historic process to bring permanent 
peace to the peoples of Israel and Palestine. Sadly, 
there has been no progress. Australia remains 
committed to a negotiated two-State solution that 
allows a secure and independent Israel to live side by 
side with a secure and independent Palestinian State. 
 Over the past 10 months I have travelled three 
times to both Jerusalem and Ramallah, where I have 
met on each occasion with Prime Minister Netanyahu 
and President Abbas. I have urged both parties to 
engage in direct negotiations. I have argued that they 
should be held on the basis of the 1967 boundaries plus 
appropriate land swaps. I have argued that the 
remaining final status issues — the right to return, the 
status of Jerusalem, the Holy Sites and the provision of 
external security — be resolved through such direct 
negotiations. 
 My fear is that if we do not see these matters 
concluded in the near term, the rapidly changing 
geo-politics of the region will make the prospects of a 
lasting settlement remote. We have already seen 
tension between Israel and Egypt. We have already 
seen the fracturing of the relationship between Israel 
and Turkey. We do not know how long the current 
framework of the Arab Peace Plan will remain on the 
table. We are fearful of a further intifada of the type we 
have seen before. 
 As a friend of Israel, we are fearful that in the 
absence of a negotiated settlement, Israel’s security 
situation will deteriorate rapidly in the year ahead. As a 
friend of the Palestinian people, we believe that the 
time has come for direct negotiations to establish a 
Palestinian State, one which also guarantees the 
security of Israel. If we fail to achieve this, I fear the 
gravity of the consequences as the ground continues to 
change across the wider Middle East. I note also that 
these views have been reflected today by the former 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.  
 Australia therefore urges both parties to seize the 
day and to shape the future of a new Middle East. We 
await the outcome from the weeks that lie ahead in 
New York, before framing our response to any 
particular resolution before the United Nations. 
 Terrorism is the enemy of all civilized peoples. A 
decade since 9/11, terrorism still casts a deep shadow 
over the security and safety of our citizens. Many of 
Australia’s finest have lost their lives in the fight 
against terrorism in Afghanistan. Australia will stay the 
course in Afghanistan, because we refuse to yield to 
terrorism. 
 While terrorism threatens thousands, nuclear 
proliferation threatens millions. Australia remains 
vitally committed to the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free 
world and is active to that end. That is why we have 
established with Japan the Non-proliferation and 
Disarmament Initiative — the NPDI — to take forward 
the agenda of the 2010 Review Conference of the 
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons.  
 As we speak in this Assembly, we should remind 
ourselves that a fifth of humanity lives in grinding 
poverty. The scale of the challenge has been 
graphically demonstrated by this year’s devastating 
drought in the Horn of Africa. I witnessed how bad 
things are when I visited the affected areas in July. 
Australia has given almost US$ 100 million. We are 
proud to be the fourth largest international donor to 
that crisis. We will continue to give. 
 Last year, we gathered to see how we were 
tracking on our collective pledge to lift a billion people 
out of poverty by 2015. The report card was very poor. 
Most of the Millennium Development Goals are 
unlikely to be achieved. Australia has doubled its 
official development assistance (ODA) budget over the 
past five years, and we are on track to double it again 
  
 
11-51179 4 
 
by 2015. Based on available data, that would make 
Australia’s ODA budget the sixth largest in the world. 
 The international community must get behind 
both regional and global efforts to meet the strategic 
need for food security. With a forecast global 
population of 9.3 billion by 2050, an estimated 
increase of 70 per cent in global food production will 
be needed to feed the world.  
 In food security, we should also be blunt. The 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is failing 
fully to meet its mandate to the poor of the world. 
Under its new management, FAO needs to set clear 
priorities for the future and eliminate the unsustainable 
administrative overheads it has long tolerated. If FAO 
does not do so, Australia will comprehensively review 
its development funding for FAO under our new aid 
effectiveness criteria.  
 Food is fundamental to development. So too is 
the right to education. All of the world’s children must 
be given a chance at life that is good for them and good 
for their economies. For that reason, and learning from 
both the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria and the GAVI Alliance, Australia believes that 
the time has come for the international community to 
consider developing a new public-private institution 
with an explicit mandate for school education. 
 At present, this task is shared between the World 
Bank, UNICEF and UNESCO, with negligible private 
sector buy-in. We should consider, therefore, a new 
global fund for education that would concentrate 
exclusively on the immediate task of getting nearly 
70 million children into schools by 2015. Australia 
would consider contributing substantially to such an 
institution to bring about real results at a rate as rapid 
as possible. I challenge education donors, current and 
potential, to join such a fund. 
 In supporting the world’s most vulnerable 
peoples, we also recognize the world’s estimated 
370 million indigenous peoples, spread across 90 of the 
193 United Nations Member States. They remain 
among the most marginalized and disadvantaged in the 
world, including in our country, Australia. That is why 
the Australian Government has reached beyond the 
apology to the Stolen Generations to pursue 
constitutional recognition for our First Peoples. And 
we are committed to closing the gap between 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. 
 Our hope of answering the development 
challenges of the world is inextricably linked to the 
health of the planet itself. The planet ultimately can 
bear only so much. Scientists tell us that there are 
planetary boundaries beyond which we should not 
venture — in climate change, biodiversity loss, 
stratospheric ozone depletion, chemical pollution, 
ocean acidification and the depletion of freshwater 
reserves. It is not just a matter of atmospheric limits, 
but of the oceans as well. 
 Next year at Rio the international community will 
have the opportunity to act decisively to protect a 
planet now in stress, just as we need to take effective 
global action on climate change. Climate change will 
not go away, even if some choose the easy path of 
simply hiding their heads in the sand. If we do that, our 
children and theirs will never forgive us — nor should 
they. 
 As the global community, we face challenges of 
historic consequence — to our global economy, to 
global security, to the basic freedoms of all peoples, to 
our global environment, to the security of our citizens, 
to our obligation to the world’s poor and to our 
planetary boundaries themselves. 
 While so many challenges lie before us, the past 
year has proven that when the international community 
does act collectively and decisively, we can deliver — 
as we have seen in the decisions of the Security 
Council on Libya and Côte d’Ivoire. But to be 
effective, this parliament of humankind, these United 
Nations, must continue to summon the political will of 
Member States to make our global institutions work. 
Otherwise, we will become a clanging gong, full of 
sound and sentiment, but ultimately symbolizing 
nothing. 
 When Secretary-General Ban came to Australia 
two weeks ago, he saw a country that values the rules-
based system that the United Nations embodies. 
Australia today is a middle Power with global interests,

5079,66,2011,NRU,"Allow me to congratulate 
Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser on his assumption of 
the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-
sixth session. Allow me also to commend his 
predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for his 
capable leadership during the sixty-fifth session. 
 I would like to begin my statement by thanking 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his historic visit to 
Kiribati and Solomon Islands earlier this month. That 
was the first time that a sitting Secretary-General 
visited a Pacific island country, and it demonstrates his 
commitment to addressing the needs of all countries, 
no matter how small or remote. From my conversations 
with the Secretary-General, I know he left the region 
with a much clearer understanding of the special 
challenges we face as small island nations. I look 
forward to working with the Secretary-General on 
finding ways for the United Nations system to be more 
responsive to the unique and particular needs of small 
island developing States (SIDS). 
 While on his tour of the Pacific, the Secretary-
General observed that  
 “Next month, the 7 billionth citizen of our world 
will be born. For that child, and for all of us, we 
must keep working to fight poverty, create decent 
jobs and provide a dignified life while preserving 
the planet that sustains us. That is why I have 
said that the sustainable development agenda is 
the agenda for the twenty-first century”. (see 
SG/SM/13780) 
 Sustainable development and poverty alleviation 
have been the overriding priorities of my presidency 
since I assumed office, in 2007. We have made great 
strides domestically, but we will still fall short of our 
ambitious goals until the international community 
chooses to create an environment in which all countries 
have the opportunity to realize their sustainable 
development aspirations. 
 Nauru’s culture and economy, like those of most 
Pacific SIDS, are heavily dependent on a healthy and 
productive marine environment. The ocean is the 
foundation of our food security and is a major source 
of Government revenue. It is for that reason that the 
Pacific SIDS are calling for the next Earth Summit in 
Rio to recognize the importance of the “blue economy” 
to small island and coastal States. I would like to thank 
Maldives, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the 
Secretary-General, for standing with the Pacific SIDS 
on this issue. 
 We have identified three priority areas for the 
Rio+20 outcome. First, we must enable SIDS to enjoy 
a greater share of the economic benefits derived from 
their marine and coastal resources. Secondly, we must 
reduce, and eventually eliminate, overfishing and 
destructive fishing practices. It is imperative that we 
ensure that our fisheries are sustainable. Finally, we 
must build up the resilience of coral reef ecosystems to 
the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. 
Adopting our proposals would begin to create the space 
needed for small islands to thrive.  
 My Government is not sitting still while it waits 
for the international community to act. This past 
summer, Nauru’s application to the International 
Seabed Authority was granted, which will enable my 
country to engage in new and innovative ways to 
generate economic growth and move towards aid 
independence. Nauru is not endowed with terrestrial 
resources, and therefore has chosen to look to the 
oceans to expand its opportunities for economic and 
social development.  
 The proceeds from our exploration and 
development of copper, nickel and manganese 
resources will go to two fully Nauruan-owned funds, 
one that supports education and training, and the other, 
health and environment. This Nauru-controlled, 
domestically driven initiative will adhere to the highest 
international environmental standards. 
 
 
15 11-51191 
 
 The sustainable development challenges of SIDS 
are widely recognized by the international community; 
however, our success in addressing them has been 
mixed at best. At last year’s High-level Plenary 
Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals, it was 
determined that progress for most Pacific islands had 
been lagging in many areas. Targeted assistance to 
address the unique and particular vulnerabilities of 
SIDS is urgently needed. It is Nauru’s position that the 
most effective way to accomplish this objective is for 
the United Nations to recognize a formal SIDS 
category, with dedicated support mechanisms. 
 Unfortunately, all of our best efforts will have 
been for naught if we do not take immediate action to 
address climate change. As Pacific island leaders 
recognized earlier this month, climate change 
represents the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, 
security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. 
 The seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, to be held in Durban, must make significant 
progress towards a comprehensive, legally binding 
agreement that can ensure the survival of all nations. 
The parties must agree to a second commitment period 
under the Kyoto Protocol, so that new commitments 
are in place by 2013. The parties must also 
operationalize the agreements reached at Cancún, 
including more ambitious mitigation commitments and 
actions, the operationalization of the new Green 
Climate Fund, and a mandate to conclude a new legally 
binding agreement based on the work of the Ad Hoc 
Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action. 
 Climate change threatens to undo all of our recent 
development gains if the major biggest polluters 
continue down the path of business as usual. Some 
Pacific islands may disappear entirely. It is an 
unfortunate reality that there is so much carbon in the 
atmosphere that many of the negative impacts of 
climate change may now be unavoidable. For that 
reason, Nauru applauds the recent open debate in the 
Security Council on climate change. While the final 
presidential statement was not as strong as we had 
hoped, it clearly recognizes the threat posed by climate 
change to international peace and security and lays the 
foundation for future work by the Council on the issue.  
 Few countries doubt the connection between 
climate change and security, but there is still 
disagreement as to the way forward. Allow me to 
reiterate the proposals of the Pacific SIDS. 
 First, the Secretary-General should appoint a 
special representative on climate and security to 
analyse the projected security impacts of climate 
change, so that the Council and Member States can 
better understand what lies ahead. Secondly, the 
Secretary-General should assess the capacity of the 
United Nations system to respond to the likely security 
impacts of climate change, so that vulnerable countries 
can be assured that it is up to the task. These two 
proposals represent the absolute minimum necessary to 
prepare for the greatest threat to international peace 
and security of our generation. 
 The Security Council must grapple with the most 
urgent security threats of our time if it is to remain 
relevant. Likewise, it should evolve along with 
emerging geopolitical realities and become more 
representative and inclusive. It is for this reason that 
Nauru supports an early reform of the Security Council 
through an enlargement of both the permanent and 
non-permanent categories and an improvement in its 
working methods. 
 We believe very strongly that new members 
should be geographically diverse. However, it is 
equally important that aspiring members demonstrate 
their commitment to addressing the most urgent 
security issues facing all Member States. As an 
example, I would like to highlight Germany’s bold 
leadership of the Security Council this past July, when 
it took the politically courageous decision to host the 
open debate on climate change. As I said earlier, 
climate change is the overriding security threat facing 
the Pacific region, and Germany’s efforts will not be 
forgotten. 
 In a similar vein, the United Nations should 
ensure that all citizens of the world have the 
opportunity to participate in its activities. We cannot 
continue to ignore the more than 23 million people 
who live in Taiwan, who have repeatedly demonstrated 
that they are a nation committed to peace and regional 
cooperation. We therefore support enabling Taiwan’s 
meaningful engagement in connection with the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the International Civil Aviation Organization. 
 The recent renaming of the Group of Asian 
States, to the Group of Asia and the Pacific Small 
Island Developing States, is a welcome change that 
  
 
11-51191 16 
 
exemplifies the inclusivity that should characterize all 
aspects of the United Nations system. I commend the 
Group for having taken this symbolic step and 
recognizing the 20 per cent of the membership that 
resides in the Pacific Ocean region. 
 However, we must move beyond symbolism to 
concrete action that addresses the actual concerns of 
small and vulnerable countries. Once again, I implore 
the Assembly to support the appointment of a special 
representative on climate and security for the benefit of 
the many nations around the world for whom climate 
change is a grave and, in some cases, existential threat. 
 My Government is preparing for a new challenge. 
In 2012, Nauru will assume the chairmanship of the 
Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). I would like 
to recognize the Government of Grenada for its 
inspirational leadership and able execution of a 
supremely difficult task. 
 I am humbled by the trust placed in us by our 
fellow AOSIS colleagues and have no illusions 
regarding the enormity of the challenges that lie ahead. 
We are entering a period in history when countries are 
turning inward, despite decades of evidence that 
cooperation is the surest path to prosperity. We must 
resist the urge to engage in zero-sum politics and 
recommit to the principles of multilateralism enshrined 
in the United Nations Charter. Durban will be the next 
opportunity to embark on a more sustainable path and 
create a world we are proud to leave for future 
generations. We should not let this opportunity slip 
away. 
 For years, leaders in the Pacific have implored 
the peoples of the world to come to our islands and see 
the impacts of climate change for themselves. The 
Secretary-General answered our call, and now he truly 
understands the urgency of our situation. 
 Earlier this week, he spoke of a little girl named 
Tamauri he met while in Kiribati (see ). 
Frightened by the rising tides around her islands, she 
asked what the United Nations could do to help her 
people. She is not alone. The children in all of our 
countries — Cook Islands, Fiji, Micronesia, Palau, 
Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Niue, Samoa, 
Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own, 
Nauru — wonder whether they will have a future. I 
look forward to working with the Secretary-General to 
meet the challenge of the climate crisis so that we can 
tell them that they no longer need to be afraid. May 
God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless 
the United Nations."
5098,66,2011,NZL,"As we say in Maori, 
to all peoples and to all voices, greetings, greetings, 
greetings to all. 
 I speak at the end of a period of intense United 
Nations dialogue and engagement. This year’s general 
debate provides unparalleled opportunities to reaffirm 
the unique multilateral role of the United Nations. And 
there has been much to debate. The events set in 
motion by a single Tunisian street vendor have 
transformed much of the Middle East and North Africa. 
People have displayed extraordinary courage in 
claiming their rights and freedoms. The transition from 
dictatorship to democracy will not be easy; it will not 
be quick; but it must be achieved. 
 For others, the struggle continues. We still look 
for change in Yemen; we still look for change in Syria. 
Other challenges are highlighted by this debate. We 
heard from the President of South Africa and others 
how the global community must move swiftly to avert 
humanitarian disaster in the Horn of Africa. 
 We heard from the President of Nigeria how 
terror networks threaten international peace and 
security, and from the President of Tanzania about 
growing piracy on Africa’s eastern coast, from Somalia 
to Mozambique. We heard calls from the Indonesian 
Foreign Minister for bold measures to avert a renewed 
global financial crisis, and we heard from the President 
of Brazil about the challenge of empowering women to 
participate in political decision-making. 
 As this debate has demonstrated, much more 
remains to be done. Lives have also been wrenched by 
natural disasters in many countries, including my own. 
On 22 February 2011, we experienced what my Prime 
Minister called New Zealand’s darkest day. An 
earthquake struck Christchurch, our second-largest 
city. A total of 181 people were killed, a loss we share 
with 15 other countries whose citizens also died. We 
were humbled by the support we received, and, once 
again, I thank those who gave that help. 
  
 
11-51681 32 
 
 Despite that disaster and the literally thousands of 
aftershocks that have followed, New Zealanders remain 
resilient and optimistic. Christchurch is being rebuilt. 
Our economy is bouncing back and the country is 
returning to normal, not least by currently hosting the 
Rugby World Cup, a celebration of a game we love, in 
the country we love.  
 Despite some cause for economic optimism, the 
events of just the past week suggest that the world still 
faces what we have long feared: a second and even 
more disastrous decline into a double-dip recession. 
We do not relish the prospect of being dragged into 
another recession that is not of our own making. We 
caution others larger than ourselves against repeating 
the mistakes of the 1930s, when autarkic protectionism 
only deepened the Depression and led to war. 
 Instead, a successful conclusion of the Doha 
Round is one of the keys to prosperity, particularly for 
those of the global South. The February Christchurch 
earthquake was followed by the devastation wrought 
on our close friend and neighbour Japan. I reiterate our 
heartfelt sympathy to Japan, so steadfast in its support 
for New Zealand in our time of need. Those disasters, 
and others elsewhere, reinforced the importance of 
effective disaster preparedness, response and recovery. 
 New Zealand will work with the United Nations, 
non-governmental organizations and international 
agencies so that the lessons learned from Christchurch 
are shared with others so that those in regions as 
vulnerable as ours can be better prepared. Indeed, in 
those regions, disaster preparedness is no desktop 
exercise; it is a matter of survival. 
 Likewise, for our Pacific neighbours, another 
high risk, climate change, is no abstract threat, 
confined to thousands of pages of reports and esoteric 
debate; it is a fundamental question of existence. For 
the Pacific, climate change is a grave and present threat 
to livelihoods, security and well-being. 
 The Secretary-General experienced those 
challenges first-hand when he visited several Pacific 
States, including one post-conflict society, and another 
whose people see, on a daily basis, the dangers of 
rising oceans. He experienced real vulnerability when 
he saw that his hotel room, in addition to the towels 
and the telephone, was equipped with a lifejacket. And 
he saw the impact of rising oceans on the viability and 
survival of many communities when his plane had to 
be “wheels up” from the country’s airport — its major 
link with the world — before the tide came in. 
 Much more of that, and whole populations will be 
on the move, as they will be in other regions of the 
world as well, and that will have with implications for 
regional and international stability and security. Faced 
with that, it is self-evident that all relevant 
international forums, including the Security Council, 
must play their part in addressing the challenge. That 
means taking urgent and effective action on emissions 
reduction. It means strengthening adaptation in 
developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable. 
And it means acknowledging and planning for the 
security implications before they become threats to 
regional and international security. 
 This year’s Durban meeting must set us on the 
road to full implementation of the Cancun agreements. 
New Zealand is committed, both through the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
negotiations and its active assistance in the Pacific and 
elsewhere, to integrate adaptation and mitigation 
measures into its development activities. 
 New Zealand also initiated the Global Research 
Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. Supported 
by more than 30 countries, the Alliance seeks to ensure 
that reducing agricultural emissions does not 
compromise global food security. 
 Increased agricultural productivity — the ability 
of many countries to feed themselves — is one of the 
great achievements of recent decades. Constraining 
agricultural production would put much of the world’s 
population at risk, and no country will do that. We 
must therefore maintain investment in agricultural 
research, so that productivity and efficiency gains can 
continue, but with fewer greenhouse-gas emissions. 
That is what the Global Alliance is all about.  
 New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. We are 
indigenous Maori; we are European; and we are the 
many peoples from the Asia-Pacific region and 
elsewhere who now call New Zealand home. We are 
also proud to be part of the Pacific Islands Forum, the 
foremost regional body. For 40 years, it has been 
central to the region’s efforts to address its own 
problems, be they the special development challenges 
of small, isolated, vulnerable island States, or halting 
and healing the impacts of violent conflict. It has done 
that in the time-honoured Pacific way, through 
 
 
33 11-51681 
 
respectful dialogue and cooperation and then through 
joint action. 
 Three weeks ago, at the Forum’s fortieth 
anniversary meeting in Auckland, Pacific leaders 
honoured that legacy by agreeing on measures aimed at 
converting Pacific potential into Pacific prosperity. 
 The themes of their discussions will resonate in 
other regions: strong, sustainable economic growth, 
protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring that 
they are healthy and educated and that they can have 
long lives. 
 A key focus of that meeting was the alarming 
incidence of non-communicable diseases, a scourge 
that is rapidly encircling the globe. Almost half of all 
New Zealand deaths relate to cancer and heart disease, 
but the situation is even more critical in many Pacific 
island countries, where diabetes in particular 
approaches epidemic proportions. We thank those who 
brought that cause here to the United Nations, 
particularly the countries members of the Caribbean 
Community. 
 With the 2012 United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development (Rio+20) very much in mind, 
Pacific Forum leaders also focused on sustainable 
development. Rio+20 will be an opportunity to assess 
the progress made since the 1992 Conference, take its 
agenda forward and highlight best practices. For 
example, New Zealand’s aid programme includes 
energy, agriculture and tourism initiatives that promote 
sustainable development. 
 Pacific peoples were navigating their ocean, the 
world’s largest, at a time when others were still 
confined to their coastal waters. New Zealand Maori 
call the Pacific the ocean guarded by the god Kiwa. 
Our region is uniquely dependent on its ocean. For 
those who call the Pacific home, the “green economy” 
is in reality a blue economy. Our ocean underpins 
livelihoods, food security and economic development. 
That is why Pacific leaders have focused on ensuring 
its sustainable development, management and 
conservation. That is why they made addressing 
acidification, pollution and illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fishing urgent matters. That is why our 
leaders want us to work towards integrated ocean 
management, with our own Pacific Oceanscape 
framework as a very good model. And that is why they 
called for Rio+20 to recognize the Pacific’s economic 
and environmental significance, and its contribution to 
sustainable development. At Rio+20, we will seek the 
support of the United Nations for that blue economy. 
 We work to protect the health of people and their 
environment, but we must also enhance collective 
security by advancing the disarmament agenda. Over 
the coming year, we must focus on the full 
implementation of the action plan agreed at the 2010 
Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. As coordinator 
for the New Agenda Coalition, a group of non-nuclear-
weapon States committed to a nuclear-weapon-free 
world, New Zealand will soon introduce a draft 
resolution highlighting the work that will be required 
to achieve its implementation during the coming 
review cycle of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons. We commend that draft resolution 
for the Assembly’s consideration. 
 There have been gains over the past year with 
respect to conventional disarmament, but we have yet 
to see the results of those achievements. There has 
been pleasing progress towards an arms trade treaty, 
but hard work remains. Next year’s Diplomatic 
Conference must deliver a treaty establishing the 
highest possible common international standards for 
conventional arms transfers. 
 We must also maintain focus on small arms and 
light weapons, which for many regions are their 
weapons of mass destruction. The year 2011 marks the 
tenth anniversary of the United Nations Programme of 
Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit 
Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its 
Aspects. There has been much to celebrate, including 
the first Open-Ended Meeting of Governmental Experts 
on the implementation of the Programme of Action, 
which I had the honour of chairing in May. But next 
year’s Review Conference must work to ensure that the 
Programme delivers on its potential for keeping 
communities safe from such weapons. 
 To deal with all of that, we need a strong, nimble 
and effective United Nations, and we need a Security 
Council that reflects geopolitical realities — realities 
that have changed since 1945. Today, some States 
might credibly seek a fuller, longer-term Council role. 
New Zealand supports change that acknowledges those 
realities. 
 But most United Nations Members are not major 
or emerging Powers, they are small States. They too 
are crucial to the universality and legitimacy of the 
  
 
11-51681 34 
 
United Nations; they too must contribute at the Council 
table. Let me put it simply: if we reform the Security 
Council to provide a fuller, longer-term role for 
emerging Powers, we must also ensure a role for small 
States. Speaking as a small State, I say that we are the 
United Nations. And so we agreed with the Minister for 
Foreign Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago when he said 
that the smallness of a country is not a deterrent to the 
realization of big dreams (see ), and with 
the Prime Minister of Cape Verde, who told us that 
small States must have a greater voice in international 
decision-making (see ). 
 There are real risks if we cannot achieve genuine 
Security Council reform. Emerging Powers will be 
denied a role consistent with their global significance, 
and small States will continue to be squeezed out of 
positions of responsibility. It is in everyone’s interests 
that the Security Council be more representative. As 
we saw earlier this year with respect to Libya, the 
Council is an extraordinarily powerful instrument for 
maintaining international peace and security. But with 
extraordinary power comes extraordinary responsibility — 
responsibility that must be exercised with regard for the 
views of all countries, large and small. 
 The Council must also build on its partnerships 
with regional groups, such as the African Union, which 
increasingly plays a critical role in maintaining 
regional and global peace and security. Recognizing 
the importance of closer relations with Africa, we are 
encouraging New Zealand investment in and trade with 
Africa, supporting peace and security and providing 
development assistance. Last week, we increased our 
diplomatic engagement by appointing a dedicated 
ambassador to the African Union and the Federal 
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. 
 New Zealand is proud of its history of active 
contribution right across the United Nations agenda. 
We have a strong record as an independent and  
 
principled voice advocating collective security and the 
rule of law. We take an even-handed approach to 
security issues, as has been shown by our voting record 
and our tangible contributions to peace processes. We 
take seriously our international responsibilities. 
 That is why, in 2004, we announced that we 
would seek a non-permanent Security Council seat for 
the 2015-2016 term. Nearly 20 years have passed since 
New Zealand’s last time on the Council. The time is 
right for us to again bring the fresh, independent 
perspective of a small Asia-Pacific country to the 
Council. That candidature, which I confirm here today, 
is based on the belief that States, large and small, have 
a place at the Council table. Modern New Zealand was 
founded on a compact, a treaty-based partnership with 
its indigenous Maori people. That, and our diversity, 
means a unique history and perspective on promoting 
tolerance and conflict resolution; a perspective that we 
have previously brought, to good effect, to the Council 
table, and which we will bring again. 
 For the United Nations, 2011 has been a truly 
historic year. The Organization has quickly responded 
to change in the Middle East and North Africa. It 
stands ready to provide post-conflict support, and not 
just in Libya. It has been critical to relief in the Horn 
of Africa. Its essential role in State recognition has 
been at global centre stage. Even the most cynical, the 
most jaded, have had to relearn that the United Nations 
is at the epicentre of much that happens, and much that 
matters. We need the United Nations. We need it to 
address the woes of the world and to consolidate its 
successes. Its fundamental importance stems from its 
universality, its legitimacy and its mechanisms to 
confront challenges. Its effectiveness depends on its 
ability to adapt as those challenges emerge and on its 
ability to address them together. Member States, large 
and small, come together in that collective endeavour. 
New Zealand, as always, stands ready to play its part."
5125,66,2011,PNG,"Mr. President, 
allow me, on behalf of the Government and people of 
Papua New Guinea, to offer our warmest 
congratulations on your assumption of the presidency 
of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. We 
pledge support for your statement highlighting the 
success of global endeavours that are founded on the 
principles of partnership, justice and responsibility. I 
also thank your predecessor, Mr. Joseph Diess, for his 
invaluable contributions to the United Nations, and I 
wish him well.  
 I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, 
His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, on his 
reappointment for a second term, and to thank him for 
attending our recent annual Pacific Islands Leaders 
Meeting in Auckland, New Zealand. His attendance at 
our regional meeting was the first by a United Nations 
Secretary-General and is testament to the strengthening 
ties between the United Nations and the Pacific region. 
We particularly note his heartfelt comments when 
describing his experiences on witnessing the adverse 
effects of climate change on low-lying atolls in the 
Republic of Kiribati and the various other development 
challenges faced by many small island States in our 
region. 
 Allow me, like other speakers, to take this 
opportunity to welcome our newest member of the 
United Nations family — the Republic of South Sudan. 
 Papua New Guinea continues to benefit from a 
strong United Nations presence through its delivery of 
various development programmes. Papua New Guinea 
welcomed and formalized the “One United Nations 
Initiative: delivering as one” concept in 2006. That has 
  
 
11-51372 4 
 
unified all the efforts of the various United Nations 
agencies under one budgetary framework, monitoring 
and evaluation process. 
 The concept will enable a more effective and 
efficient way for the United Nations to deliver on its 
mandate, particularly the new country programme for 
Papua New Guinea, to be rolled out at the beginning of 
January 2012. It will target the areas of governance, 
social justice, health, education, gender, the 
environment, climate change and disaster management.  
 That new country programme is part of our 
overall efforts to achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs). Since the inaugural MDG report was 
published in 2004, Papua New Guinea has produced 
two MDG progress reports. The first, in 2009, was a 
summary report and the second, in 2010, a 
comprehensive report. They showed that we have been 
able to achieve some of the national MDG targets, 
especially on poverty reduction and child mortality. 
 In terms of universal primary education, Papua 
New Guinea is progressing well, with the enrolment of 
children in grades one to six increasing significantly — 
by 53 per cent. That is a marked improvement and will 
increase the literacy rate in the long term. Our 
Government recently announced a policy of free 
education from the elementary level to year 10 and 
subsidized education from grade 11 to university, 
commencing 2012. 
 We are also revamping our national health system 
to improve immunization programmes, to provide a 
clean and safer water supply, to centralize the purchase 
and supply of medical drugs, and to reduce maternal 
and child mortality and the incidence of malaria, 
HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The 
recent important summit on non-communicable 
diseases, attended by our Minister for Health, 
reiterated our equal responsibility for our own, our 
families’ and our communities’ health and well-being. 
 Our Government remains committed to achieving 
the MDGs, and we are now scaling up progress in all 
relevant sectors. Our new Development Strategic Plan 
2010-2030 and Medium Term Development Plan aim 
to develop and foster key enabling environments, 
which will raise Papua New Guinea to a middle-
income country and improve its Human Development 
Index ranking. 
 We call on all our development partners to 
complement our efforts to achieve the MDG targets in 
line with our national development plans and policies. I 
believe other developing countries will support our 
call. 
 We are also investing heavily in the rehabilitation 
of our major transport infrastructure, including roads, 
airports and seaports. Aside from that, we are also 
rolling out rural communication systems and rural 
electrification. As we are all aware, improved 
infrastructure will enable effective service delivery. 
 Women play critical roles in all facets of our 
development. Our Government is conscious of the need 
to have more women participate actively in the affairs 
of state and in the economic life of our country. I am 
pleased to report that we have recently passed the first 
vote on a parliamentary bill that will provide for 
22 seats reserved for women to contest in the coming 
elections in 2012. That provision does not stop them 
from contesting any of the existing seats. 
 We also appreciate the push by multilateral 
partners like the Asian Development Bank and the 
World Bank for gender equality. In the same breath, 
however, we urge them to support our financial 
institutions by specifically allocating funds without 
risk to be lent to women entrepreneurs to develop 
business opportunities. 
 We note the recently adopted San Francisco 
Declaration by the countries member of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) last week, 
under the leadership of the United States of America. 
That is a major step forward in supporting women in 
business and is a powerful tool for women of the APEC 
member countries. We will encourage our women in 
Papua New Guinea to take advantage of the 
opportunities created by that Declaration. 
 There remain many other global challenges that 
continue to affect the development aspirations of many 
of our countries. One is nuclear non-proliferation. The 
Pacific remains a nuclear-weapons-free zone. We call 
upon other Member States who are not yet signatories 
to sign and ratify the Rarotonga Treaty. 
 The illegal use, abuse and the dangerous 
proliferation of small arms and light weapons continue 
to hamper the development aspirations of many 
developing countries. We therefore call upon the 
international community to deal seriously with 
 
 
5 11-51372 
 
outstanding issues such as the illegal supply of and 
trade in small arms. Our Government will do all it can 
to accelerate the implementation of the 
recommendations in our own Gun Summit Report. 
 On transnational crime, Papua New Guinea 
remains committed to working closely with other 
Governments and relevant international law 
enforcement agencies to curb drug trafficking, human 
trafficking and money-laundering. 
 As one of the top five remaining rainforest 
nations, we are committed to addressing the many 
challenges of climate change, biodiversity and 
sustainable development of our forests. We continue to 
maintain dialogue with all stakeholders, being mindful 
that issues confronting many nations on climate change 
are very complex. 
 In the matter of United Nations reform, we 
support and encourage the reform of the United 
Nations, its agencies and its Secretariat, to make them 
more responsive to and active in responding to global, 
regional and national challenges. We reiterate our call 
for an expansion of membership in the permanent and 
non-permanent categories of the Security Council, 
which must take into account the geopolitical realities 
of today’s world. 
 In terms of our contribution to the maintenance of 
international peace and security, I am pleased to 
announce the deployment of our uniformed personnel 
as military observers. That is history in the making for 
our country, and we thank the United Nations for 
giving us the opportunity for our security personnel to 
participate in international peacekeeping duties. 
 On regional issues, tuna is an important source of 
food and is, along with tourism, an economic resource 
for the Pacific island States. Papua New Guinea and 
countries that are parties to the Nauru Agreement are 
determined to process tuna onshore to add value and 
create employment for our people. We encourage 
investors to invest in onshore activities. 
 At the Pacific regional level, we are conscious of 
our obligation to conserve fisheries through sustainable 
fishing. The parties to the Nauru Agreement have 
introduced the Vessel Day Scheme to limit the total 
catch for conservation purposes. In addition, Papua 
New Guinea continues to make funds available to the 
South Pacific community to tag tuna species so that we 
are can quantify and assess the tuna stocks for the 
future. 
 Over the past nine years, Papua New Guinea has 
continued to experience unprecedented economic 
growth levels of 6 to 8 per cent per annum. That has 
been largely attributable to significant increases in 
foreign investments in our mineral and hydrocarbon 
sectors and to the high prices of our agricultural 
commodities. Those economic growth levels have 
positioned Papua New Guinea to become a significant 
development partner within our region. 
 Papua New Guinea greatly values the objectives 
and principles of the United Nations Charter. We 
reaffirm our support for the maintenance of 
international peace and security, the development of 
friendly relations among nations and working together 
towards the achievement of the aspirations of all of our 
peoples."
5184,66,2011,KIR,"I bring warm greetings from the 
people of Kiribati, on whose behalf I address the 
Assembly. I wish to join previous speakers in 
congratulating you, Mr. President, on your election to 
the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-
sixth session.  
 We gather here every year as world leaders to 
represent our peoples and to discuss issues of concern 
to the global community. At this session our theme is 
the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by 
peaceful means, which is appropriate in its reminder to 
us that peace and security are indeed crucial to the 
continued harmonious existence of mankind on this 
planet. 
 As a global community we constantly face many 
challenges to our political, social and economic 
stability. Natural and human-induced disasters have 
caused much suffering in different regions of the 
world. Countries and peoples are facing all kinds of 
security threats from armed conflicts, terrorism, human 
trafficking, economic recession, climate change and its 
associated impacts. As a result, many communities 
suffer daily from increasing poverty, hunger and 
dislocation. 
 But how can all this be happening in a 
supposedly rational world community under the 
scrutiny of this global body? Is our existing 
Organization in its current form equipped to deal with 
these emerging issues, or is it time to review the 
structure and effectiveness of our international 
governance system?  
 The lack of progress on climate change 
negotiations clearly demonstrates the wide divergence 
  
 
11-51191 30 
 
of positions on the issue. I believe that unless we can 
approach any mediation with trust and commitment, 
we will be caught in the vicious circle of starting with 
our differences, in our obsession to protect what we 
perceive to be our critical national interests. 
 I would like to thank the Secretary-General for 
his comments based on his experience during his recent 
visit to Kiribati. His views are those of an independent 
observer who came, who saw and who believed. His 
comments are a powerful endorsement of what we, the 
most vulnerable countries, have been saying over the 
years, and my hope is that this will communicate the 
need for urgent action to all who possess a sense of 
moral responsibility. Climate change will remain the 
curse of our planet. Most nations perceive it to be a 
future event, but for the very few it is already reaching 
disastrous levels. 
 Some will argue that climate change does not fall 
within the conventional definition of a security threat, 
but that is simply because it may not be so for them at 
this point in time. In Kiribati, many young people go to 
sleep each night fearing what may happen to their 
homes overnight, especially during very high tides. 
The accelerated and continued erosion of our shoreline 
is destroying settlements, and as I speak, some 
communities are relocating on the island. I was glad 
that the Secretary-General was able to understand and 
feel for himself the sense of threat that our people and 
those of similarly vulnerable countries experience on a 
daily basis. 
 In the international climate-change forums there 
is ongoing dialogue and negotiation in an attempt to 
find amicable solutions to this threat. But there is an 
ongoing disagreement on how to address this global 
challenge. The question is: how much longer must we 
continue to argue about this? When are we going to do 
something about it? Our people and our children, 
whose lives and future are under serious threat, look to 
us for leadership. The urgency of the need for action 
cannot be overemphasized.  
 At Cancún, it was my understanding that there 
was agreement on the need for an urgent package to 
address the situation of the most vulnerable countries, 
which are now being seriously affected by the adverse 
impacts of climate change. Next year, we will gather 
again as world leaders to take stock of what we have 
done since the Rio Summit in 1992. It is my fervent 
hope that, in the light of current scientific evidence and 
based on the experiences of the most vulnerable 
countries, we as a global community will embark on 
bold and innovative initiatives to address the climate 
change challenge. I acknowledge with gratitude the 
adoption of resolutions 63/281 and 65/159 on the 
possible security implications of climate change and 
the protection of our global climate for present and 
future generations. And I thank those who saw and 
supported the need to classify climate change as a 
security issue. 
 In December, there will be another United 
Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban. I 
acknowledge that climate change negotiations will take 
several years to conclude, but I also believe that there 
is common ground on which there is no real debate. 
The urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to 
address the more urgent adaptation needs of the most 
vulnerable countries is a matter on which I believe 
there is general consensus. But what is the point in 
consensus if no concrete action follows? Kiribati was 
one of the countries that did not sign the Copenhagen 
Accord because of what we saw as its serious 
shortcomings, but we were subsequently persuaded to 
associate ourselves with it on the premise that doing so 
would trigger the flow of much-needed adaptation 
funds that had been pledged. Today, we continue to 
await those funds. 
 We all want to achieve sustainable development. 
We are grateful to those who have continued to assist 
and partner with us on this journey, but our efforts at 
achieving sustainable growth will continue to be 
frustrated by external factors. Ongoing uncertainty in 
the global economic climate and rising food and fuel 
prices remain major challenges to our sustainable 
development efforts. On top of all that, our increasing 
preoccupation with the impacts of climate change will 
progressively dominate our national agenda.  
 It is no surprise, therefore, that we continue to be 
off track in the achievement of most of the Millennium 
Development Goals and the implementation of our 
sustainable development agenda under our national 
development plan. Every step we take forward we are 
knocked back two or three due to the many challenges 
we face. It is therefore imperative that climate change 
adaptation funds be mobilized at the earliest 
opportunity. Otherwise, we will be forced to divert 
development resources towards the most urgent 
adaptation needs. Therefore, as we move towards 
Durban, it is our hope that the Green Climate Fund can 
 
 
31 11-51191 
 
be operationalized as soon as possible to allow the 
most vulnerable countries to attend to their adaptation 
needs from new resources. 
 In the same vein, we believe that all nations and 
peoples — including Taiwan — that play a role in 
international affairs, including contributing to climate 
change, should also be part of the solution. During 
these difficult times, and facing challenges to our 
existing world order, we can ill afford to isolate any 
nation that has the capacity to assist in our struggles.  
 I believe that, as a global community, we must be 
united in our efforts to address any security threat to 
international peace and security, be it within States or 
between States. We need to forge consensus in our 
collective action to promote and maintain our 
collective security. Let us work together as a global 
community to address the many conflicts and disputes 
that are posing serious security challenges to our well-
being, before they consume and condemn our 
civilization to oblivion. 
 In closing, I share our traditional blessing of 
health, peace and prosperity."
5190,66,2011,PLW,"It is an honour and a 
privilege to address the General Assembly once again 
on behalf of the people of Palau. 
 For thousands of years, Palau was blessed by a 
natural bounty that sustained our livelihood and bound 
us together as a people. We lived in remoteness and 
isolation by respecting the environment and managing 
our natural resources for the benefit of every 
generation. 
 Today, however, we find ourselves to be innocent 
victims of transboundary harm. Forces beyond Palau’s 
control, and not of our own making, are ravaging the 
oceans, damaging the land and reefs, threatening our 
way of life and, in the worst-case scenario, our very 
existence. Although we do our best to act responsibly 
and sustainably, there is only so much my country can 
do on its own to protect itself. We therefore rely on our 
partners, the international system and on the 
international rule of law to provide a remedy. 
 I would like to speak today about three pernicious 
types of transboundary harm.  
 First, I point to the state of global fisheries. 
Palau’s fish are among the most valuable in the world, 
but they are in danger. Distant water boats do not 
respect our borders, laws or traditions. These boats 
come in great numbers for tuna in the Western and 
Central Pacific region, where Palau is located. At 
present, our region’s tuna is being taken for pennies on 
the dollar. These boats also hunt, fin and sell sharks for 
a tiny fraction of what tourists will pay to see those 
sharks alive in our waters. 
 Like the ocean’s currents, efforts to protect the 
marine environment must flow across boundary lines. 
It takes international cooperation to protect our marine 
resources and environment. 
 Palau and other Pacific small island developing 
States have undertaken innovative measures to ensure 
the continued viability of our stocks. We have limited 
purse seine fishing, agreed to close the “donut holes” 
between our jurisdictions and implemented a Vessel 
Day Scheme. 
 
 
27 11-50871 
 
 Two years ago, from this very rostrum, I 
announced the creation of the world’s first shark 
sanctuary. Since that time, countries and territories 
across the globe have joined Palau in this effort. Today, 
more than 2.7 million square kilometres of ocean are 
safe for sharks. Our ocean’s health depends on sharks, 
so I am delighted that earlier today several 
representatives of States in different parts of the world 
joined me to declare our shared commitment to 
conserving the ocean’s vast biodiversity and nurturing 
and protecting shark sanctuaries. But that is just the 
first step. 
 Global fisheries should be sustainable. Reckless 
practices that harm our fisheries and threaten our food 
security should stop. That means that shark finning 
should stop. Bottom trawling, which destroys the base 
of the marine food web, should also stop. 
 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations reports that 85 per cent of global fish 
stocks are now fully or overexploited. These are the 
worst numbers on record. The international community 
must find a way to make regional fisheries 
management organizations more accountable, so that 
the world can see whether countries are living up to 
their commitments. And global fisheries should be fair. 
If distant water vessels want to come to fish for our 
resources, they must respect our laws and those of our 
region. They should fish within our prescribed limits 
and share the mutual benefits with us in a fair and 
equitable manner. 
 Fishing is not a right. It is a privilege. For too 
long, the exploitation of tuna has overridden efforts to 
conserve it. This imbalance is not sustainable and must 
be reversed. This should be done by creating a tuna 
conservation zone to make the conservation of this 
valuable resource paramount and to maximize the 
benefits to the nations in our region where tuna is 
harvested. We who live in the Pacific see the ocean as 
our farm, the source of our sustenance and livelihood. 
At the biggest-ever Pacific Tuna Conference, to be held 
in Palau in early December, that concept of a tuna 
conservation zone will be considered and applied to 
our region of the world. We should continue our efforts 
to maximize the benefits to our islands of sustainable 
tuna fishing in our waters. 
 Secondly, we fear that this year undetectable 
amounts of nuclear radiation may have entered our 
territory. This is a particularly insidious form of 
transboundary harm. I was involved in writing Palau’s 
Constitution, which bans the presence of any nuclear 
material in our territory. We are proud to have been the 
first in the world to institute such a prohibition. But the 
supreme law of our land cannot protect us from 
potential radiation coming from outside our borders. 
We fear the possibility that someday our fish may not 
be safe to eat and our water may not be safe to drink. 
And so we ask the world to redouble its efforts to 
eliminate the threat of nuclear radiation. 
 Thirdly, as I speak, people are suffering from the 
effects of climate change. As our corals die, shores 
erode and waters rise, people feel helpless and 
hopeless. Traditionally, we would appeal for divine 
intervention. But this is not a problem from above; it is 
manmade. It poses an existential threat that exemplifies 
the issue of transboundary harm. Today, I regret to say 
that we are nowhere close to a solution. Next year will 
mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. But have we made progress? While sea levels 
have risen, emissions continue unabated. We are still 
without a binding agreement. 
 This past July, the Pacific small island developing 
States banded together to put before the Security 
Council modest, achievable and prudent proposals for 
addressing the security threats of climate change. But 
our voices were drowned out by other States’ priorities. 
I can only agree with the views expressed in the 
Council by the United States: the failure of some States 
to acknowledge the clear-cut security implications of 
climate change is pathetic. 
 However, we will not be deterred. Leaders of the 
Pacific States have declared that the urgent social, 
economic and security threats posed by climate change 
require action in every international forum. The 
General Assembly, in its consensus resolution 63/281, 
invited the relevant bodies of the United Nations to 
intensify their efforts in considering and addressing 
climate change, including its possible security 
implications.  
 With this in mind, Palau and the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands will call on the Assembly to seek, on 
an urgent basis and pursuant to Article 96 of the 
Charter of the United Nations, an advisory opinion 
from the International Court of Justice on the 
responsibilities of States under international law to 
ensure that activities emitting greenhouse gases that 
  
 
11-50871 28 
 
are carried out under their jurisdiction or control do not 
damage other States. 
 The case should be clear. The International Court 
of Justice has already confirmed that customary 
international law obliges States to ensure that activities 
within their jurisdiction or under their control respect 
the environment of other States. Similarly, Article 194, 
paragraph 2, of the United Nations Convention on the 
Law of the Sea provides that States shall take all 
measures necessary to ensure that activities under their 
jurisdiction or control do not spread or cause damage 
by pollution to other States. It is time we determined 
what the international rule of law means in the context 
of climate change. The International Court of Justice is 
mandated to do just that. 
 At the opening of last year’s General Assembly, 
His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated 
that “At the United Nations, we find the proper path in 
community, global cause … and mutual responsibility 
for a destiny we share” (A/65/PV.11, p. 1). That 
sentiment means, first and foremost, that countries 
must do no harm, particularly to the most fragile 
among us. We should find guidance in the international 
rule of law. Nations must respect fellow nations. 
Whether the issue is destructive fishing practices, 
nuclear radiation or excessive emissions, nations must 
work together and cease to cause transboundary harm. 
 I would like to share with the Assembly a number 
of important initiatives that Palau is undertaking to 
connect with the international community, literally and 
in spirit.  
 Palau is currently connected to the Internet by 
satellite. However, the service is poor and the cost 
unaffordable for most of our people. Last year’s report 
of the International Telecommunication Union’s 
Broadband Commission confirms that broadband 
access is a prerequisite to achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. According to the report, a 10 per 
cent increase in broadband penetration in developing 
countries increases GDP by 1.4 per cent. Imagine what 
a 100 per cent increase could do. 
 In light of that report, I have signed Executive 
Order No. 297 establishing a presidential task force to 
acquire a submarine fibre optic cable so that Palau will 
be better equipped to meet its Millennium 
Development Goals. I hope that others will cooperate 
to help Palau connect to the world, and that leaders 
will answer the Commission’s clarion call to ensure 
that all people have access to broadband networks by 
2015. 
 Palau is also reaching out to the world on human 
rights. In February, we began our Human Rights 
Council Universal Periodic Review. As a former 
practicing attorney and human rights advocate, I have 
been an ardent supporter of this process from the 
outset, and so I have committed Palau’s limited 
resources to ensuring a complete and meaningful 
outcome. As evidence of that commitment, I 
established a task force chaired by our Minister of 
State and comprised of officials from across a broad 
spectrum of our Government. Stakeholders from 
non-governmental organizations and civil society were 
also invited to become involved in the operations of the 
task force and contributed significantly to Palau’s 
national report. 
 By all accounts, Palau’s response was a great 
success. The Human Rights Council unanimously 
adopted our report. The most repeated recommendation 
from Human Rights Council members was that Palau 
should establish a National Human Rights Institution. I 
have taken this recommendation to heart and am 
pleased to announce that Palau will establish a 
National Human Rights Institution. I am also pleased 
to announce that, as of this week, Palau is now a 
signatory to all core international human rights 
conventions. I hope others will assist Palau as we build 
our institution and work to fulfil our obligations under 
those conventions. 
 Once again, I wish to bring to the world’s 
attention the fact that the fierce battles fought by 
foreign armies over Palau’s islands during the Second 
World War left explosives scattered across our land and 
in our waters. Some of those explosives, which number 
in the thousands, are still live. I appeal to the 
conscience of the world and, especially, of those 
responsible, to help us remove this danger from our 
midst. 
 I would like to thank the Secretary-General for 
attending the recent meeting of the Pacific Islands 
Forum, held earlier this month in Auckland, New 
Zealand. That meeting was the Forum’s fortieth 
anniversary and was the first time that a United 
Nations Secretary-General has attended our regional 
meeting and the first time that a United Nations 
Secretary-General has visited a Pacific small island 
developing State. I would like to thank His Excellency 
 
 
29 11-50871 
 
Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his visit. It is a testament to the 
fact that the countries of our region, even the smallest 
and most vulnerable among us, have something 
important to say and to contribute to our world. 
 I would also like to express Palau’s gratitude for 
the strong support and friendship of all of our partners, 
new and old. In particular, I would like to thank the 
United States of America, Japan and the Taiwan 
province of China. 
 In order to further promote the efficacy, goals and 
ideals of the United Nations, we recommend that 
Taiwan be invited to participate meaningfully in the 
United Nations system. I believe that the United 
Nations cannot fully and properly address the issues of 
health, aviation safety and climate change unless 
Taiwan is allowed to participate in the activities of the 
World Health Organization, the International Civil 
Aviation Organization and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. Once 
again, I appeal to the world to allow Taiwan to 
participate in these important United Nations entities. 
 Finally, Palau is a relatively new State, having 
joined the world community in 1994. Thus, we 
remember well the jubilation of our new-found 
freedom and independence. I take this opportunity to 
congratulate the people of South Sudan on attaining 
their independence and taking their rightful place here, 
in United Nations."
5212,66,2011,MHL,"On behalf of 
President Jurelang Zedkaia, I bring warm greetings 
from the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the 
General Assembly. The Marshall Islands also welcomes 
South Sudan as the newest Member of the 
Organization. 
 The Marshall Islands congratulates the Secretary-
General for making nuclear disarmament and nuclear 
safety a top priority at the United Nations during his 
second term. Fifty-seven years ago, at the dawn of the 
Cold War, the United Nations held the Marshallese 
people in trust. Marshallese leaders petitioned the 
United Nations to put a halt to the testing of nuclear 
weapons. The United Nations responded with 
Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV), adopted 
in 1954, and 1493 (XVII), adopted in 1956. Acting 
with assurances of our protection, the United Nations 
and its administering authority, the United States, 
detonated 67 large-scale nuclear explosions in the 
Marshall Islands. For decades, Marshallese leaders 
have returned to the United Nations to speak of the 
continuing impacts — cancer, fear and continued exile 
from our homeland — and of a science where 
goalposts are always moving. 
 Three weeks ago, the leaders of the Pacific 
Islands Forum, in their communiqué, not only 
recognized the special responsibility of the United 
States of America but also agreed to support the 
Marshall Islands at the United Nations, including in 
addressing the issue of the Secretary-General’s report. 
The United Nations has a clear responsibility to 
acknowledge and address the consequences of nuclear 
testing undertaken under its watch — and a special 
responsibility has already been acknowledged by the 
parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons. 
 Last year, the General Assembly requested the 
Secretary-General to report on the effects of atomic 
radiation in the Marshall Islands. Such a report would 
represent the potential for the Marshall Islands, the 
United States and the United Nations to take a very 
positive step forward towards understanding our past, 
bringing closure to this sad chapter in our history and 
beginning to understand how the international 
community can assist us in addressing future 
remediation challenges. The involvement of the United 
Nations is key. 
 Sadly, I am concerned that the Secretary-General 
has thus far neglected this critical opportunity. The 
United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of 
Atomic Radiation, which was invited to contribute to 
the Secretary-General’s efforts to assemble a report, 
has termed the General Assembly’s deliberate mandate 
to be “not appropriate” and “an apparent error” in need 
of formal correction (A/66/46, para. 13). 
 That is not only insensitive but it reveals that 
perhaps the United Nations itself has yet to come to 
terms with, or even to merely acknowledge, its 
decisions on nuclear safety taken 60 years ago. That 
negative approach could preclude efforts to bring to the 
attention of this body important scientific work that has 
been done in assessing the consequences of the nuclear 
testing in the Marshall Islands. 
 It is our hope that United Nations will have the 
courage and will to rise above the past and make a 
difference, rather than allow itself to remain controlled 
by history, and make excuses. As I said earlier, for 
decades, Marshallese leaders have returned to the 
United Nations to repeatedly speak of the legacy of the 
nuclear testing in our country. It is my hope that one 
day a new generation of Marshallese leaders will come 
to this forum not to speak of this sad legacy, but rather 
to proclaim that the work is done and that all is well. 
 The impacts of nuclear testing are not the only 
historical legacy from international actors in the 
Marshall Islands. Unexploded ordnance from the 
Second World War and oil leakage are persistent issues 
for our outer island communities. They pose threats to 
our human security, public health and environmental 
safety. We welcome the attention of Pacific Island 
Forum leaders, and we join the call for assistance from 
international bodies and development partners. 
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands is not just a 
small island State; we are a large ocean nation. 
  
 
11-51398 14 
 
Together, the oceanscape of the Pacific islands is an 
area that covers 10 per cent of the world’s surface and 
is four times the size of Europe. The way we manage 
our maritime space is therefore a central pillar in our 
basic development aspirations, and has significant 
implications for the health of global oceans. 
 International commitments to ensure sustainable 
fisheries and to visibly advance our development 
aspirations can no longer be paid mere lip service and 
then later be ignored by our partners in regional 
processes, including the Western and Central Pacific 
Fisheries Commission. The Marshall Islands presently 
only sees a penny of benefit for every dollar of the 
market value of our Pacific tuna. The conservation 
measures by the parties to the Nauru Agreement, 
including the Vessel Day Scheme and high seas 
closures, must be implemented by our partners, not 
only to reduce pressure on overfished stocks but also to 
ensure our rightful place as a full economic actor. 
 Twenty years ago, global leaders meeting at Rio 
de Janeiro set forward a high international benchmark 
for sustainable development, crafting a range of 
strategies and commitments. Next year, the critical 
United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development must not only focus on moving towards a 
global green economy but must also pay specific 
attention to a global “blue economy” — one that 
ensures specific, measurable and time-bound targets 
for guaranteeing the sustainability of the global oceans 
and their fish stocks, particularly in regions dotted by 
small island States like my own. Greater commitment 
is needed to utilize targeted global high seas closures, 
thereby ensuring sustainable fisheries, as we are 
already doing in the Pacific. The hour is past for vague 
rhetoric. Leaders must respond with action rather than 
continued neglect for the world’s oceans. 
 The Marshall Islands warmly welcomed the visit 
this month by the Secretary-General to the Pacific 
region. The Secretary-General was able to see for 
himself the vulnerability and existential threat facing 
low-lying island States. He has now rightfully 
challenged world leaders to respond. What were once 
theoretical and distant risks are now on the verge of 
becoming our reality. 
 International climate negotiations are at serious 
risk of entering a phase of political stalemate. 
Negotiators have spent more than two decades in 
complicated processes that have delivered very little in 
terms of practical action to mitigate the climate change 
problem. Often blocked by only a handful of countries, 
the international community is still unable to commit 
to emissions cuts and targets sufficient to ensure the 
survival of the Marshall Islands and other low-lying 
nations. 
 The Marshall Islands can wait no longer. We are 
now choosing creative paths to drive urgency into our 
broken negotiations and to pursue practical initiatives 
to address the threats and risks. First, the Marshall 
Islands joined with the Government of Mexico in 
urging the United Nations in its coming Climate 
Change Conference to consider the use of voting as a 
means of last resort. Secondly, in July, we joined with 
our Pacific small island developing States colleagues to 
push for the Security Council to recognize that climate 
change now poses an incontrovertible threat to 
international peace and security.  
 We reiterate our call for the Secretary-General to 
report on those threats. Petty arguments about forums 
and mandates cannot be allowed to prevail at the risk 
of our statehood. All organs of the United Nations must 
now be proactively engaged. We do not need 
sympathy; we need solutions and political innovation. 
 Thirdly, the Marshall Islands is carefully studying 
options for clarifying the relevant international 
obligations related to climate change and how it affects 
our statehood. Working with our close neighbour, the 
Republic of Palau, we are committed to pursuing 
requests for legal advisory opinions from international 
tribunals in order to recognize the international legal 
principles that address questions of our survival and 
security in the context of climate risks. We have also 
agreed to work with Palau and other vulnerable and 
low-lying countries to formulate and advance our own 
legally binding climate agreement. We, the most 
vulnerable, must act when others lack the political will 
to do so.  
 As a significant global economic leader, Taiwan 
can make substantial contributions to the international 
community. The Republic of the Marshall Islands 
welcomes increased dialogue on key cross-Strait 
issues. That progress deserves recognition by the 
international community. Given that the primary 
purpose of the United Nations is to maintain 
international peace, the world cannot afford to 
overlook Taiwan’s strong efforts in promoting peace 
 
 
15 11-51398 
 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, including with 
regard to climate change. 
 The 2009 invitation by the World Health 
Organization for Taiwan to participate as an observer 
has not only benefited global medical progress, 
including on non-communicable diseases, but also 
serves as an effective model for its wider participation 
in other key organizations. We urge the United Nations 
and its Member States to consider that model and 
develop effective means for Taiwan’s participation in 
specialized agencies, including the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
International Civil Aviation Organization. 
 The Security Council must transform itself into 
an effective and contemporary body. The Security 
Council should be restructured to accommodate those 
nations whose size, leadership and responsibility, in 
particular the Group of Four — Japan, Germany, India 
and Brazil — warrants a permanent presence in the 
Council. Further efforts should be made to ensure that 
Africa and small nations, including island States, have 
improved access and an amplified voice. 
 The General Assembly witnessed a historic 
moment last week, in which, for the first time, the 
general debate was initiated by a woman, namely, 
President Rousseff of Brazil. The Marshall Islands 
welcomes the Secretary-General’s renewed priority on 
addressing gender, including a strengthened 
UN-Women institution, particularly in the Pacific. 
 The message for nuclear weapons, global security 
and climate change is the same: international law is not 
an empty promise."
5216,66,2011,VUT,"Vanuatu joins other 
delegations in congratulating you, Mr. President, on 
your election to preside over the General Assembly at 
its sixty-sixth session. My delegation vows our full 
cooperation, and believes that, with your leadership, 
we will conclude a successful session. 
 
 
9 11-51372 
 
 Allow me to also acknowledge the leadership of 
your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, for 
his exceptional guidance and for the considerable and 
important achievements of the previous Assembly 
session. 
 In the same spirit, on behalf of my Government, I 
take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency 
Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to the post of 
Secretary-General and to commend him on his vision, 
leadership and tireless efforts in moving towards 
achieving the common interests of all humanity. 
 I would also like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the Government and the people of the 
Republic of South Sudan on the birth of their new 
nation on 9 July. Vanuatu recognizes the sovereignty of 
South Sudan, and offers the young nation our full 
support.  
 The theme of this year’s General Assembly 
session, “The role of mediation in the settlement of 
disputes by peaceful means”, calls for more creative 
and feasible peaceful multilateral solutions to many of 
our long-standing disputes that, unless resolved 
peacefully, will have far more extensive global 
consequences. The settlement of disputes by peaceful 
means is central to the United Nations system, as 
enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in 
numerous international conventions and treaties. In that 
context, we, like many others, encourage our brothers 
and sisters in Israel and Palestine to continue the 
peaceful negotiations that will ensure regional and 
global stability. We also call upon the United Nations 
to visit the framework with which it fulfils its 
mediation mandates and to develop closer partnerships 
with mediation actors within regional groups. To 
succeed as responsible nations of this global village, 
we must continue to cultivate an environment that 
thwarts the seeds of bitterness, hatred and vengeance. 
 In establishing the United Nations in 1945, many 
nations, great and small, entrusted it with the 
responsibility to assist in maintaining international 
peace and security, developing friendly relations 
among nations, and promoting social progress, better 
living standards and human rights. However, 66 years 
after the founding of this multilateral Organization, the 
world that we live in is far from the ideals for which its 
inception was intended. Across the globe, people from 
all walks of life continue to be subject to colonial rule, 
death threats, arbitrary detention, torture and worse, 
and are killed for exercising their rights to freedom of 
expression. Untold crimes against humanity and other 
human rights atrocities still continue. 
 While we reaffirm our faith in multilateralism, 
with the conviction that bilateral diplomacy cannot 
substitute for multilateralism, we also believe that our 
nations have a greater need of a more robust 
multilateral system that is swift and efficient in 
responding to the multitude of challenges that members 
of this highly esteemed system, acting unilaterally, 
would be hard done to defeat. We are delighted to note 
that one of the four priorities of the President of the 
General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session is to 
continue the work on the reforms within the United 
Nations. 
 In that context, this year’s establishment of the 
Change Management Team within the Organization, in 
particular, is a step in the right direction. That initiative 
comes at a time when members of this body are calling 
on the United Nations to play a more prominent role in 
a period of rapid change and financial restraint in 
building a culture of transparency, accountability, good 
governance and enhanced democratic participation, and 
to achieve efficiency and results. 
 As regards the Security Council, Vanuatu is 
steadfast in its belief that reform measures must 
provide for democratic and geographically strategic 
representation in both the permanent and the 
non-permanent membership to reflect the realities of 
this century. We continue to lend our invaluable 
support to the candidacies of the many countries vying 
for membership within the non-permanent seat 
category of the Security Council. We hope that 
sustained reforms will help to boost the Security 
Council’s peacekeeping role and to increase efficiency 
and transparency in promoting the universal standards 
and common values and customs that form the basis of 
global security and development. At this juncture, let 
me acknowledge the work of the peacekeeping and 
nation-building missions of the United Nations in 
supporting new countries, such as Timor-Leste, South 
Sudan and others, in their nation-building. 
 On 9 September 2011, we marked the tenth 
anniversary of the twin towers bombing that wreaked 
havoc in the city of New York and claimed more than 
3,000 lives. Such acts of terrorism can never be 
justified, whatever the causes they claim to be 
  
 
11-51372 10 
 
advancing and to whatever grievances they claim to 
respond. 
 Despite international efforts to counter terrorism, 
major threats remain. Indeed, the world cannot sit idly 
by, watching the forces of evil threaten humanity’s 
right to peace and security. Terrorism cannot and must 
not be allowed to flourish. Vanuatu condemns, in the 
strongest possible terms, all forms and manifestations 
of terrorism, and calls on all countries to join forces to 
fight against its evil ideologies, activities and financing 
in order to make the world of tomorrow a safer place. 
All countries must work closely in eliminating that 
scourge. 
 Today, the lack of progress on disarmament and 
non-proliferation, cornerstones of global security, is 
disturbing. The world’s nuclear Powers must fulfil 
their vows to meet their obligations under the Treaty on 
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to take 
decisive and practical steps towards irreversible 
disarmament. Only then will the proliferation of arms 
reverse. 
 My people welcome the strenuous efforts of 
President Obama and other world leaders, working 
together at the vanguard to advance negotiations on 
denuclearization. The very recent events in Japan’s 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster clearly show that 
whatever safeguards are in place, there can be no 
absolute guarantee that those can withstand the 
unforgivable ferocity of Mother Nature. They are 
important lessons for us. 
 Four years after the global financial crisis began, 
in 2007, the economies of many developed countries 
continue to struggle, stirring financial markets 
worldwide with fresh fears of impediments, default and 
possible recession. For small developing countries, 
such as Vanuatu, the rise in food prices, high fuel costs, 
soaring commodity prices, fears of a global recession, 
as well as the other unforeseen effects of the global 
financial instability and uncertainty that remain in 
many developed countries, are having multifaceted 
consequences. 
 Such developments, coupled with the ongoing 
effects of climate change and natural disasters, 
continue to threaten the economies of small island 
nations, and to undermine all efforts towards the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to ensure that 
sustainable development is achieved. 
 Vanuatu has made some progress towards 
achieving the MDGs, but much more needs to be done 
by pooling our own resources at the national level and 
by engaging the international community in 
coordinating efforts so as to achieve our MDGs. 
 The convening of this year’s thematic group on 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is indeed timely. 
In my country, it is estimated that approximately 75 per 
cent of deaths each year are related to NCDs. 
Furthermore, the immediate causes of the NCD 
epidemic — tobacco use, unhealthy diets, physical 
inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol — are 
becoming increasingly widespread in our society, 
especially in urban areas. Those self-inflicted diseases 
are, therefore, becoming a major barrier to our socio-
economic development and to achieving healthy 
islands and the MDGs.  
 At this point in time, my country is undertaking, 
for the first time, a national NCD STEPS survey to 
determine and to better understand the burden and the 
extent of NCDs and their determinants in our 
communities so that we can better target our 
intervention efforts in future. Early this year, Vanuatu 
launched its revised NCD strategy and policy for the 
period 2011 to 2016 to guide our implementation 
efforts in the coming years. We have also implemented, 
over the years, many key NCD strategies to empower 
our people to increase control over their health and its 
determinants, with the assistance of our development 
partners, such as the World Health Organization, the 
Australian Agency for International Development and 
the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 
 In terms of economic performance, Vanuatu’s 
economy grew at an unprecedented average rate of 
6 per cent between 2003 and 2008. Economic growth 
has since weakened, mainly as a result of exogenous 
shocks felt during the ongoing global financial crisis. 
That has had a negative impact on Government revenue 
in the past few years, adding further strain on the 
economy. That said, the need for significant increases 
in financial support from development partners remains 
pressing. The announcement of a considerable increase 
in credit facilities at the Group of Twenty London 
summit in 2009 was welcome news. However, the 
reassertion of those financial commitments and swift 
action need to be rigorously followed up by the donor 
community. 
 
 
11 11-51372 
 
 The previous assessment by the United Nations 
Committee for Development Policy of Vanuatu’s 
development status as a least developed country has 
showed a progressive pace in development. While 
graduation may be imminent, I must underscore, before 
the Assembly, that most challenges of the small island 
developing States are permanent. The challenges of 
smallness, the distance to major metropolitan markets, 
extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and climate 
change, the sea-level rise and vulnerability to tsunamis 
all constitute permanent characteristics of our island 
nations. It is therefore important for the United Nations 
to ensure that multilateral mechanisms for graduation 
and a transition package must not be detached from 
those permanent realities. We are delighted that the 
President of the General Assembly has vowed to pay 
special attention to vulnerable States such as ours. 
 Climate change and ocean acidification remain 
the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security 
and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific, 
particularly for small low-lying Pacific islands. High 
greenhouse gas emitting industrialized countries must 
start to embrace and to accept the common but 
differentiated responsibilities in historic contributions 
to climate change. 
 As the former Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, 
I, along with my fellow leaders of the Pacific Island 
nations, particularly welcome the historic visit of 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the Pacific. I call 
on the United Nations to undertake more senior 
missions to the Pacific region so as to establish a more 
comprehensive understanding of how susceptible the 
people of the Pacific are to the adverse impacts of 
climate change and sea-level rise, as embodied by the 
case of Kiribati. 
 I call on leaders of advanced nations to renew and 
honour their pledges to finance, in particular, efforts to 
help the most vulnerable communities to address their 
adaptation needs in order to ensure that island nations 
survive the impending global disaster that climate 
change may afford. An increased global fund to 
strengthen the capacity-building efforts of vulnerable 
communities, in particular, to integrate climate change 
into economic policies and actions, is pressing. 
 As we prepare for the Conference of the Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (COP 17) talks in Durban, my 
Government urges all delegations to work tirelessly to 
pledge to a second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol. Durban must advance all aspects of the 
climate change negotiations and devise strategies to 
operationalize the COP 16 decisions if any concrete, 
balanced and ambitious outcomes are to yield results. 
 Colonialism and all forms of imperialism must be 
addressed by the United Nations, for one of the reasons 
why the United Nations system was created was to 
develop friendly relations among nations, based on 
respect for the principles of equal rights and the self-
determination of peoples. Therefore, colonial rule is 
obsolete and must be addressed with new drive and 
vision. The United Nations, as well as the international 
community, must continue in their efforts to address 
issues of decolonization in those Non-Self-Governing 
Territories that still yearn for freedom.  
 The mandate of the Special Committee on 
Decolonization must be strengthened. All means should 
be accorded to the Committee to allow it to magnify 
the suppressed voices of the peoples in all Non-Self-
Governing Territories that are still under the control of 
administrative Powers, especially where serious human 
rights violations are reported. 
 My country, Vanuatu, was the last in the Pacific 
region to be decolonized. Since our independence in 
1980, we have continued to speak out for the 
inalienable rights of the colonized indigenous peoples 
of Oceania and in certain parts of the Asian region, 
where either administrative or colonial Powers still 
retain authority. 
 My Government also calls upon the United 
Nations to ensure that the demands for French 
Polynesia’s right to self-determination are not rejected. 
We, along with many other Pacific island nations, 
support calls for the reinstatement of the French-
administered Territory with the United Nations Special 
Committee on Decolonization. That would be the first 
major step in the process of their self-determination. 
Vanuatu encourages the French-administered Territory 
of French Polynesia and, in the same spirit, that of 
New Caledonia to continue to seek meaningful 
dialogue with France in order to find ways to ensure 
that the freedom of the colonized peoples of Oceania is 
fully realized. 
 Enshrined in the core principles of the United 
Nations Charter, the Organization must guarantee 
universal respect for the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of all the oppressed. The universal pursuit of 
  
 
11-51372 12 
 
democratic reform, good governance and adherence to 
human rights conventions have often concealed the 
suffering of many people, denying them their right to 
decide their destiny without fear or reprisal. The 
United Nations must step up its efforts to exercise their 
freedom from the tentacles of foreign rule, so 
troublesome a misgiving in these modern times. 
 One day, all the indigenous peoples of Oceania 
and beyond must reach their goal of freedom, a 
destination promised to all humanity and a right that 
the Creator endowed upon all peoples and that no 
earthly Power can deny, to determine where they live 
and to be self-ruled in free association with the 
international community of nations. 
 Let me take this opportunity once again to 
reiterate to this eminent Assembly our serious concerns 
over the infringement by foreign forces on the political 
freedom of many of our nations today, a right denied to 
the people of the land to exercise their freedom to 
control their lands, a freedom denied by the injustices 
of the global world order that demarcated many of our 
lands, dividing peoples, families and cultures and 
disconnecting us from the traditions of our ancestors. 
Denying the right of a country to exercise its political 
freedom over its maritime territorial boundaries and 
preventing the indigenous people of a country from 
exercising their culture and traditional linkages with 
integral part of its lands, sovereign since time 
immemorial, remain one of the greatest crimes of our 
times. We are therefore calling on the United Nations 
to ensure that our fundamental rights can be exercised 
in all parts of our territory. 
 As the world unites in addressing some of the 
major challenges of our times, the lifting of the 
economic embargo on Cuba is long overdue. Denying 
the good people of Cuba from fully participating in the 
global economy is inhumane. T is high time that the 
Cuban people be allowed to enjoy their rights and 
freedom as an independent and sovereign nation. 
 It is time that we all revisit the aspirations and the 
ideals with which the United Nations system was 
created and join forces to weed out injustice, 
colonialism, poverty, hunger, war crimes, terrorism and 
the like in the hope of creating a peaceful and secure 
world for generations to come. All nations, great and 
small, must respect each other’s sovereignty, for that is 
the way to achieve trust and to ensure a dignified 
confidence among all friends gathered around the table 
of the United Nations. 
 I also welcome Fiji’s commitment to full and 
democratic elections by September 2014. As a Pacific 
neighbour, such as announcement is timely. 
 In conclusion, I wish to take this final 
opportunity to express my gratitude to Vanuatu’s 
development partners for the support that they provide 
in building our economy. I believe that more can be 
done to help small vulnerable island countries like 
Vanuatu to address the rising challenges confronting 
them. 
 Leaders of the world, the resounding echoes of 
history drum in our ears and remind us of what must be 
done tomorrow. The global forces driving the changes 
that will shape our future must beckon towards a world 
where people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, beliefs, 
faiths, cultures, traditions and origins can live in 
harmony and peace, as brothers and sisters."
5238,29,1974,NZL,"Mr. President, I congratulate you most warmly on your election to the President's chair, for which your qualities and long experience as Foreign Minister of your country so admirably fit you. I wish you well in the direction of our business, which includes many important and some difficult issues. The year of your presidency will be an important year. We shall in fact be getting to grips with matters which are central to the future welfare, and even the existence, of human society.
4.	First of all, I must speak of the recent tragic death of our beloved Prime Minister, Mr. Norman Kirk, who last year spoke for New Zealand in this debate. He was a good and humane man -a champion of the poor and the weak. We were deeply touched and comforted by the sympathy shown to us by people from all over the world at the time of our loss. Such solidarity occurs only when we lose a leader who has risen above local concerns, as he did one who has worked to advance the cause of the whole human family. The response to his death suggests that multitudes hunger for new attitudes among the leaders of nations. New Zealand will miss him greatly. But my Government will still try to bring to reality his personal vision of a new world social and economic order. We shall continue to strive, as Mr. Kirk did, to translate into international terms the vision of a decent and humane society which motivates our policy at home. Our goal remains to help to harness the great resources and skills of the people of this planet, so that everyone, not just a few, will have a chance to live as human beings should. We shall continue to work to strengthen the United Nations as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations and for protecting the rights of the smaller nations.
5.	The last three years have witnessed a remarkable change in national attitudes. In 1972, the year of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm, the international community became aware of, and accepted the existence of certain physical limits to economic growth: limits to the availability of natural resources and of food; limits to the amount of pollution that can be discharged into the environment before inevitable and unwelcome consequences follow. In 1973 the world began to receive sharp, warnings of some of these physical limits, particularly in the supply of energy and of food. It became painfully apparent that our ability through existing institutions to make efficient and humane use of the world's talents and resources for the common good was more limited than we had thought and more limited than we could put up with.
6.	In 1974 it became obvious that the world had better make a more serious effort to understand the interdependence of all peoples and all States. At a number of historic conferences the nations at last started to study realistically the fundamental changes that will be needed if we are to bring about the new order that the world requires a new order that will ensure a more equitable use of the world's resources to meet the demands of the future. These conferences included the sixth special session of the General Assembly, on raw materials and development, the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, the World Population Conference, 1974, and, soon, the World Food Conference. The common theme of these conferences was, and will be, interdependence. Whatever subject is studied, the same lesson emerges: we are one people, we are all one of another; and if we ignore that truth all of us will suffer and none of us may have a future in any meaningful sense of the word at all. At one time only visionaries and preachers spoke in such terms. Now the message has spread to the so-called practical people.
7.	Governments, in their concern about the state of the planet, are having to look up from problems of local tension and conflict which are themselves hard enough to solve and to face fundamental issues affecting the very survival of humanity. The great issues of today are population, food, energy, natural resources, the environment and the embracing need for an economic order which will enable all people to realize their full potential as human beings. For the immediate and foreseeable future these constitute the agenda these will be the primary concerns of the international community and of the United Nations. Our success in dealing with them will largely determine the climate in which relations between States will develop in the next decade.
8.	Detente is not just a question of political relations between the great Powers. True, detente must be based on a general acceptance of the interdependence of the great Powers and the small, of developed and developing nations. It must be based on the willingness of all of us to work together to solve the problems about which I have spoken. What alternative is in fact open to us?
9.	To deal first with the subject of food, the shortage of food is growing worse. The international community has recognized the urgent need to act and to deal with the situation. Without food there can be no human energy. The World Food Conference will be a vitally important meeting. World food stocks have sunk to the lowest level in 50 years. We are now living literally on a hand-to-mouth basis. The assessment prepared for the World Food Conference has indicated that there will be a very significant food deficit in developing countries in the 1980s. Others have forecast the possibility of mass starvation by the end of the century. As a matter pf Immediate anxiety, a grave food shortage looms next winter. Weather conditions have reduced the harvests in the United States and Canada, and, therefore, the possibility of their being used, as they so often have been, as a backstop. The drought in the Sahel has brought famine to Africa. Further shortages seem likely to hit countries in Asia.
10.	Weather is one cause of these troubles but nations are also at fault. The institutions for producing and marketing and distributing food have failed us. Above all, they have failed those countries and those people on the lowest incomes. There is an enormous unused potential for food production, but the international community has not yet devised ways of sharing its resources and skills for the benefit of all. The World Food Conference must provide the framework for such co-operation. If a crisis situation is developing, there will be a tendency to concentrate on short-term food aid. A world food security arrangement, which has so far eluded our efforts, is more necessary than ever be-fore. We must ensure that arrangements are made for sufficient stores of food, so that people do not starve in the emergencies which past experience teaches us will unfortunately occur from time to time.
11.	The world, however, cannot just rely on the traditional food producers, There is a fundamental imbalance in food production. The answer is not to produce more and more food in the rich countries and ship it off as aid to distant parts. We must give top priority to increasing national production in developing countries. In many regions there are untapped resources of land and water. These can and must be utilized to expand food production. It is essential that the World Food Conference produce arrangements that will transfer agricultural technology to developing countries and increase the supply of the agricultural inputs they must have: money, energy, fertilizer, seeds, chemicals and equipment.
12.	Most of New Zealand's special expertise is in the varied field of agriculture. We have shaped our development assistance and technical co-operation according to programs to make it available to others who need and want it. In the last year over 30 per cent of our bilateral aid involved the transfer of agricultural technology, materials, equipment and training. In providing this aid we are making a strong effort to ensure that it is practical and literally down to earth. Our friends in the South Pacific tell us that in the past years their islands have been nearly buried by feasibility studies, surveys and reports by international experts. They have been studied and surveyed beyond all bearing. What they want now is action. So do we. We do not underestimate the value of research. Our own agricultural success has depended on it very much indeed. But we think that if production is to be increased, as it should be, this will be done by men prepared to dirty their hands in the field, and not by those who polish the seat of a chair in a distant office. We for our part try to avoid inflicting on other people chair polishers disguised as experts. And we hope that the students from other countries whom we train in New Zealand will get the message that countries are developed only by hard work and effort, and that workers are deserving of equal respect whether they wear collars and ties or just shirts.
13.	As a major agricultural exporter, New Zealand certainly shares the interest of developing countries and other States in the orderly marketing and distribution of food. We are constantly working for the elimination of barriers to trade and for the creation of stable markets at fair prices. Obviously in this area we are working in our own interest; but we believe also that we are working in the interests of others just as much as in our own. The World Food Conference should provide constructive guidance to the multilateral trade negotiations at present under way. We hope it will also give the incentive to remove the present stumbling blocks to progress in these negotiations. This is an area of activity in negotiations in agricultural trade that is usually dull and hard, and greatly complicated by national politics. But if food is to be produced in much greater quantity and it must be if the rapidly growing number of people are to be fed we must get an imaginative breakthrough in this vital field.
14.	I have spoken of our concern about the world food shortage. I have said that we wish to make available to developing countries the benefits of the technology and expertise that we have built up in our agriculturally-based economy. Together with our colleagues from Sri Lanka, we have promoted emergency arrangements to ensure that the countries most in need can obtain sufficient supplies of nitrogenous fertilizers at prices they can afford.
15.	We are convinced that real and lasting progress can be made by developing countries only if aid policies are closely co-ordinated with trade and monetary policies. The sixth special session of the General Assembly was an historic event, in some ways a revolutionary event. Its consequences will work themselves out over many years.
16.	But the most important revolutions, we believe, occur in men's minds, not in the streets. Colonialism collapsed in two decades because of a conviction that its day was over. As the cumulative result of years of effort in education, sometimes through oratory and pressure, the conscience dormant in most people was brought to life and even the colonial Powers came to share this conviction, some more slowly than others. But I believe that we are now on the brink of another and even more profound shift in attitudes. We are beginning to accept, not just in words, but through practical decisions, that all members of the world society in which we live have a just claim on the wealth and the more decent life that that society can make possible. To discuss a new economic order is now to discuss reality.
17.	A momentum has been established. Much more discussion will no doubt be required before consensus is reached on specific actions and before the change in attitudes is complete. But to achieve this we have to keep up the momentum and concentrate the energies of the international community on a manageable, realistic field of action. For our part we would like to suggest that the Assembly at this session identify as priority tasks for the coming year the four main issues for priority action: food, trade access, reform of the monetary system and emergency assistance. We think it would be useful if at this session the Assembly directed the subsidiary organs of the United Nations to bear this in mind in drawing up their own agenda and work programs.
18.	At the sixth special session, the General Assembly established an emergency program of measures to help the countries hardest hit by the economic situation [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]. My country has allocated $10 million for this program. At the meeting to be held on 27 September on this subject I shall give more details of this contribution. However, we believe that a firmer basis should be established within the international community for providing large-scale emergency assistance whenever the need arises. We must have the means to avert the risk of the energy crisis or any other similar catastrophe creating a 'fourth world' of countries so hopelessly placed that they are without any prospect of economic and social development for decades to come. My Government accepts that developing countries must increase their share of international trade, principally through improved access to the markets of the developed countries of the world. We support the generalized system of preferences and we are at present reviewing the New Zealand scheme with a view to introducing improvements into it.
19.	New Zealand does not play a major role in the world financial institutions. But we have supported, and will continue to support, the principle that the developing countries should be full participants in discussions leading to major decisions on the international monetary order.
20.	L turn now to disarmament. Against this back-ground of human need, which all the speakers this morning touched on, it is surely tragic folly, to squander resources at an ever-increasing rate to perfect weapons of destruction. We already have enough nuclear weaponry to obliterate all life from this earth several times over. Almost everyone says he wants to stop the arms race and to use the scarce resources that would be saved for constructive purposes: for aid and human welfare. Each year this Organization solemnly proclaims how essential it is that additional resources be devoted to economic and social development. Each year it proclaims the need for disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament. Yet each year its proclamations are ignored. We now watch with despair medium-sized and even small-sized Powers trying to follow the bad example of the great nuclear Powers.
21.	Since the Assembly last met in regular session the tempo of nuclear-weapon testing has been stepped up. Two super-Powers have told us that a decade must elapse before they will be able to disentangle themselves from the spider's web of the arms race- a decade to strike what they choose to call 'a strategic balance'.
22.	In the same time-span we face the prospect, even the certainty, if the international community does not act with vigor to prevent it, that there will be further additions to the nuclear club. Given the example set by the super-Powers and I do not feel at all comfortable in lecturing others we have to say that we completely reject the notion that the possession of these dreadful and suicidal weapons can in some way enhance a nation's status or security. On the contrary, the greater the number of States that possess such a capacity the more unstable the relationships between States will become and the greater will be the danger to world peace. We are deeply concerned that recent events may undermine the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. Some find defects in this Treaty, but, despite, the defects, it does offer a path back to sanity and reason.
23.	For many years the nations of the South Pacific have been close to the testing of nuclear weapons. Interested parties may argue that the tests are harmless, but those of us who have been closest to them are keenly aware of the dangers that testing poses for the human environment. We know that these tests can create anxiety and apprehension in ordinary people everywhere. We urge that this Assembly again assert, clearly and without equivocation, that testing in every form must be ended, soon, urgently, through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The Assembly should act to advance the principles of the non-proliferation Treaty.
24.	We believe that the Assembly should stand ready to encourage positive proposals from countries of a given region to increase regional stability and security. In recent years that search for international security and stability has been given new impetus through regional activities. New Zealand continues to see merit in this approach, and we urge outside States to co-operate fully in giving effect to these initiatives by smaller countries in various parts of the world.
25.	I come now to the law of the sea. The law of the sea occupies a crucial place among the issues upon which the international community should focus most urgently in the coming year. In a world where population and resources press heavily upon one another, it is of critical importance to agree upon a just use of the resources of the oceans.
26.	The session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas this year was especially important for the countries of the South Pacific. It gave New Zealand and its neighbors a most welcome chance to stress the special dependence of small island nations on the sea island States such as those in the South Pacific are at a disadvantage: they are geographically remote and they have very few agricultural and mineral resources. The development of their nearby maritime areas represents one of the few ways in which they can hope to supplement their slender land resources. New Zealand was encouraged that at Caracas these special needs were generally recognized.
27.	Much work remains to be done; but we were heartened by the progress made. For the first time we now have within reach the essentials of a new agreement on a 12-mile territorial sea and a 200-mile economic zone. Undoubtedly, there will be a great deal of hard negotiation to come before a fair and balanced agreement can be reached on all the major issues. New Zealand, as a coastal State, recognizes the just interests of others: of the land-locked States and of those with limited access to the resources of the sea. We recognize the just interests of all countries, but especially the developing countries, in preserving the 'common heritage of mankind'' in the resources of the deep sea-bed. We hope that all countries will look to the next session of the Conference, in 1975, as the stage at which compromises must be made. And we believe that, if approached in that spirit, the session will lead quickly to the final treaty.
28.	I shall now speak of the South Pacific and Niue. In connexion with the South Pacific islands, but in a different context, we are pleased to note that in a referendum on 3 September the people of Niue chose to become fully self-governing, in free association with New Zealand: On 19 October New Zealand and Niue will end their relationship of administering Power and Non-Self-Governing Territory; we will enter a new period of partnership on a basis of equality. As a self-governing State, Niue will take its place as a full member of the South Pacific Forum along with other independent and self-governing States in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea. Niue's new Constitution contains my Government's assurance that New Zealand's economic assistance to Niue will continue as before. During the process of self-determination it has been helpful for the people of Niue, as well as for New Zealand, to have the United Nations constantly and closely involved.
29.	New Zealand is conscious, as never before, of the importance of Africa on the world's stage. We see the need, not only for Africa but also in the wider interests of the international community, to find lasting and peaceful solutions to the problems of that continent.
30.	It is understandable that the situation in southern Africa should be of such continuing concern to this Assembly. New Zealand stands solidly with the world community in rejecting the policy of apartheid in South Africa. My Prime Minister welcomed a recent opportunity to assure the Chairman of the Special Committee on Apartheid, Ambassador Ogbu of Nigeria, that New Zealand would continue its stand on sporting contacts with South Africa: South African teams will not be allowed to enter New Zealand, unless they represent a sport in which apartheid is not practiced.
31.	New Zealand also continues to offer practical support to the victims of apartheid: it contributes to the United Nations Educational and Training Program for Southern Africa, the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the United Nations Trust Fund for Namibia.
32.	In addition, my Government has decided to contribute more than $200,000 over a two-year period to a joint project with UNICEF to provide humanitarian assistance through liberation movements for the tens of thousands of displaced persons from Southern Rhodesia, Namibia and Angola who are at present living in -Zambia. This money is given to supply drugs, vaccines, high-protein food supplements, agricultural tools and educational aid.
33.	Before I conclude, may I express my Government's pleasure at the admission of Bangladesh, Grenada and Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations. We welcome also the historic change which now allows us to look forward to the early admission of two other important African countries, Mozambique and Angola. Their accession to independence will mark a major step in the process of decolonization and a further major step in the liberation of Africa. It will bring us still closer to the full realization of the principle of universality, to which my Government attaches great importance.
34.	I have said that the primary concerns of this Organization today are people, food, energy, natural resources, the environment and the need for a new economic order. These are universal concerns; every nation has a duty to play its part in helping to solve them. New Zealand believes that all nations can best do this within the great family of the United Nations, accepting the obligations as well as the privileges of membership.
"
5346,29,1974,AUS,"Mr. President, in this year in which Australia has established diplomatic relations with Algeria, it gives me particular pleasure, as head of the Australian Government, to congratulate you upon your election as President of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The Algerian experience has encompassed many of the greatest problems facing the world and the Organization today. Sir, your nation's experience—and your own—ensure distinction and significance to your occupancy of this high post.
3.	As head of the first Australian social democratic Government since Australia helped to found the United Nations and to frame its Charter more than a quarter of a century ago, I reaffirm our loyalty to both. Such pledges are easily enough given; yet no nation makes them more sincerely, more earnestly today, than Australia.
4.	No country more than Australia needs the fulfilment of the international objectives of the United Nations to reach the fulfilment of her own national objectives. There are few countries in which the paradox is demonstrated with such force that true national independence depends upon international interdependence. There are few nations to which the mirage of national self-sufficiency can be made so tempting; yet there are few nations for which that mirage can be so easily dispelled. Australia, fortunate in possession of great resources, confident in the ability of its own people to develop those re-
sources, is nevertheless not ashamed to admit its interdependence with its neighbours and its partners across the world and its dependence upon them. We are a people without illusions; we Australians neither falsely exaggerate our strengths nor fearfully exaggerate our weaknesses. It is precisely because we make a rational assessment of our strengths and weaknesses that we recognize that we depend upon a better international order to preserve those things we most value about our national independence/In seeking a better international order, we give primacy to the United Nations.
5.	It is therefore with growing concern that we witness what can only be called a drift away from international order and international co-operation at present occurring in world affairs. Australia's concern springs not just from the real difficulties created by recent events but, even more, from the feeling that there has been a weakening of will, a loss of momentum, in international determination to meet and overcome those difficulties.
6.	Great hopes were born two years ago. The Australian Government whole-heartedly endorsed the movement towards detente between the United States and the Soviet Union. We whole-heartedly supported China's return to her true place in the family of nations—in the Organization and in the world. We whole-heartedly .endorsed the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam, signed in Paris on 27 January 1973. We therefore ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex], moved our China Embassy from Taipei to Peking, and ended our own military involvement in Indo-China.
7.	Above all, we have been determined to do all we can to ensure that our region and the world should not for a second time lose the opportunity for a new settlement, a new step towards peace and progress, in the way that the chance was thrown away after the war in Korea and after the Geneva meetings in 1954. Yet we have to acknowledge that the hopes springing from the remarkable events of 1971 and 1972 are beginning to sour. There is increasingly a sense of drift, a sense of events out of control. The task of this Assembly should be to help to stop that drift. Our natural preoccupation with our national problems —and for most of us they are very great indeed—must not lead to a loss of international concern and involvement.
8.	We cannot turn inwards. Even the most immediate problems of domestic worry—such as inflation, which so many of us share, the strongest, the most highly developed along with the weakest and the least developed—are in essence international problems for which there can be no ultimate, no complete national solution without an international solution. No nation, no group of nations, no bloc, no alliance, can live alone, can live entirely to itself in this new world. We are all internationalists now—by necessity. Australia is internationalist by necessity and by choice.. Each of us has our bilateral arrangements and our regional arrangements. Many, like Australia, through treaty or trade or tradition, have honourable alignments and valuable associations.
9.	It is, however, through this Organization, its Assembly and its councils and through the specialized agencies that the enduring international settlements must ultimately be sought and the drift away from international co-operation must be arrested. So there must be no loss of nerve, no loss of will here. If we here lose our nerve, if we here allow that drift to continue unchecked, we face the break-down of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty , the break-down of world economic order, the break-down of all our high hopes and high words about closing the gap between the developed and the developing nations and the breakdown of any claims of the United Nations to be an effective peace-keeper and peace-maker. We should all stand guilty of betrayal of our peoples if we did not act now to stop the drift in these matters.
10.	The special obligations which the might of the super-Powers imposes upon them should not be made an excuse for indifference or indecision on the part of the rest of us. We continue to urge upon the superPowers the need for them both to maintain the utmost mutual restraint in their relations between themselves and towards us. They can, of course, easily destroy each other; they can also destroy all of us. We are entitled to ask them to move forward to a stage of complete detente where their tremendous power can be used jointly for the betterment of the whole civilization. We are entitled to insist upon restraint in their deployment of forces overseas, in areas such as the Indian Ocean. Australia is strongly opposed to the Indian Ocean becoming a ground for competition, much less confrontation, between the great Powers.
11.	Mutual restraint is also essential to prevent the excesses and the dangers of the nuclear arms race. Let me recall that those of us who are so far parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have given the nuclear Powers certain rights; they in turn have accepted certain responsibilities and given guarantees, as part of a two-way process. We undertook not to develop nuclear weapons in return for guarantees of protection and assistance in the development of nuclear knowledge for peace. Above all, the sponsoring Powers undertook to promote and maintain a world order based upon comprehensive disarmament. Unless these obligations are sincerely fulfilled, the incentive abroad and the pressure at home for more and more nations to get nuclear weapons will increase. A co-operative effort by all leaders must find effective means of halting the arms race and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There is nothing more urgent facing any of us today.
12.	Australia therefore sees with deepest anxiety the continuing and new testing of nuclear devices, the prospect of an ever-increasing number of nations possessing nuclear weapons and an even greater number possessing the capability of exploding nuclear devices. Where it has been open to Australia,
we have expressed our concern , in action before the International Court of Justice.
13.	All of us face a nightmare world in which as many as 15 or 20 nations may possess nuclear weapons by the early 1980s. There is time to prevent it. We have perhaps about a year, two years at the most, in which to prevent it. Now is the time; it may be our last chance. For our part, the Australian Government pledges that it will neither develop nor acquire nuclear weapons.
14.	Our first aim must be to strengthen the non-proliferation Treaty and to work for its acceptance everywhere. Real and rapid progress can best be made through that Treaty. We should build on what we have. We have not time to start all over again. Six years after it was concluded and more than four years after it came into force, some States have still to ratify the Treaty or to make clear their renunciation of nuclear weapons development. Certainly we understand the difficulties the Treaty presents to some nations. We understand their reservations. We acknowledge the discriminatory aspects of the Treaty as it now stands. We would hope that the forthcoming conference to review the Treaty will remove some of these difficulties, but the conference will be more successful and meaningful if more nations ratify the Treaty and work within its framework to improve it and to apply it.
15.	Secondly, we should make a comprehensive treaty to ban nuclear-weapons testing an urgent priority. The treaties which have been concluded and the resolutions which have been adopted are important achievements, but they have not gone far enough towards stopping the nuclear arms race. They are only steps towards universal and comprehensive agreement on nuclear-weapons testing. We must complete the journey .
16.	Thirdly, we need effective international arrangements to govern and to control nuclear experiments for peaceful purposes. We all recognize the promise which scientific collaboration on the peaceful uses Of nuclear energy holds for economic development in the interests of all mankind. But the world cannot afford the risks which lie in the prospects of increasing numbers of countries possessing nuclear devices—even if they profess to have them for peaceful purposes only. We cannot shrug off nuclear explosions which present us with such a threat, particularly explosions conducted outside existing safeguards and without international inspection. Australia seeks support for an international arrangement by which all States could gain access to nuclear explosive services for peaceful purposes under agreed and secure international controls. We urge all nuclear States to co-operate in establishing such a service, preferably under the auspices of IAEA. I join with the Foreign Minister of Canada in this call [2242nd meeting].
17.	Another approach to the goal of disarmament worth serious exploration is the concept of peace zones. Such zones are of course no substitute for comprehensive disarmament and no substitute for an effective non-proliferation Treaty. Australia, however, takes a particular interest in the agreements and proposals embodying this concept, because most of them directly affect our continent and our region. The Antarctic Treaty,1 the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 {XXVI)}, the ASEAN Declaration,2 the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)3 and the proposal by Iran for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East [AI9693] all move in the right direction. They command Australia's broad support since they assert the dangers inherent in an uncontrolled, unregulated use of our planet for the deployment of nuclear weapons; they seek to limit the development, emplacement and use of nuclear weapons in the: areas and environments they cover; they all express growing anxiety about the spread of nuclear weapons; they all seek paths towards reducing tensions among the nuclear Powers. For the Australian Government, these initiatives not only represent ends in themselves but, we believe, they serve to stimulate progress on other important measures intended to bring to fulfilment the hopes of mankind to live in security, free from the threat of nuclear war.
18.	Let me say that Australia's anxiety about the nuclear arms race does not blind us to the risks to international peace and security from localized conflicts using conventional weapons. We, the members of the international community, stand condemned for our failure so far to find the sense of responsibility and the means of authority to stop regional disputes being settled by force. It is equally bad that some members of the international community have made possible —for profit—massive recourse to arms and to the means of waging* wars about to start or wars already begun. A world order that permits, or that by default sanctions, the large-scale transfer of weapons from one country to another where the risk of conflict is high, is gravely at fault and very foolish. This short-circuits the process of peaceful negotiation and gives first place to the settlement of disputes by war, by bloodshed and, as always happens—and must always happen in modern wars—by the bloodshed of the innocent.
19.	Clearly , we still have far to go before the international community will agree collectively to forsake the short-term gains on arms sales abroad in return for the longer-term but less tangible benefits that such a self-denying ordinance would confer on the weapons producers. Nevertheless, we now ask that the major weapons-producing countries should set an example by imposing the strictest restrictions on the export of arms abroad to areas where there is a clear risk of conflict.
20.	Recent events have shown that the preservation of peace is more than a matter of arms control; it is also a matter of keeping the peace When violence threatens or occur?. It is not enough for Members of the United Nations to pay lip-service to the United Nations peace-keeping role. Individual Members have the duty to provide the material and financial resources to allow the United Nations to deal with threats to security, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression.	
21.	Australia stands ready to participate in peacekeeping operations in whatever way would be most useful. Australia is, of course, allied by treaty with the United States, and we make no apologies for that. There is, however, no area of actual or potential conflict anywhere in the world where loyalties, ideology or interests should make an Australian involvement
in peace-keeping unacceptable or unwelcome. We wish Australia to be always among the first nations of which the United Nations would ask peace-keeping forces. We shall be among the first to respond. We undertake to keep the Secretary-General regularly informed of the nature and size of the contributions we are able to provide over a given period.
22.	Australia further believes that the importance of preventive diplomacy must come to be more widely recognized and accepted, and that the ample provisions offered by this Organization for peace-keeping and good offices should be reinvigorated, explored more thoroughly and exploited more thoroughly. It is time, therefore, to look again at the hitherto untapped provisions of the United Nations Charter and to make all that we can of its capacity to provide useful contributions to such activities as fact-finding, conciliation, mediation and negotiation.
23.	We here should particularly devote increased attention to the role of the International Court of Justice. Not enough nations use the Court. Members of the international community cannot be compelled to take their cases before the Court, but we should strive to build confidence in the Court's worth, its wisdom and its workability as one way of rationalizing and harmonizing international relations. If the. rule of international law and justice is to prevail, then an international tribunal is indispensable. The Court's jurisdiction should be widened. Jurisdiction should become compulsory and universal. New multilateral treaty arrangements, like that which will emerge from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, should enforce compulsory settlement of disputes, with the International Court as the final court of appeal. By such steps the rule of law can be established and strengthened in a better world order.
24.	In this difficult, complicated, crowded world we are all creating for ourselves, the causes of conflict multiply. Nuclear brinkmanship, ideology, border disputes, race hatred, religious bigotry, national ambitions, foreign exploitation—all provide actual or potential sources of tension, conflict, bloodshed and war. Yet there remains for the future one of the oldest of all causes of war-—the threat of war for the possession of resources. Huge population increases, the revolution of rising expectations, the enormous and often wasteful demands our technological civilization makes upon the world's resources —all have increased the pressures on our world civilization to the very limit of the tolerable.
25.	For countries which lack resources, the situation has become critical. The developing countries have been grossly disadvantaged; Last year's oil crisis brought that sharply home to all of us, developed and developing alike.
26.	It is proper that in this world forum I should state the Australian Government's attitude to the use and development of Australia's own very considerable resources. There is no place in our thinking for economic nationalism in its crudest sense. We do, of course, wish to ensure steady markets at fair prices for what we produce. We recognize the great scope for increased co-operation between producers of raw materials and for groups of exporting countries to associate to build a better framework for orderly and rational development of production and trade. As a relatively developed and thriving nation whose production of many resources is also shared by developing and poorer nations, Australia recognizes its duty to co-operate with such nations in obtaining a fair and reasonable return for our products, and we are co-operating.' Equally, however, we in Australia accept our responsibility to reassure countries which depend upon our resources that they shall have steady, secure access to those resources at fair prices. We must protect our interests, and we shall, but Australia is not in the business of resources blackmail. That is the way to international disaster, for producers and users alike.
27.	Let us accept the plain fact that war for resources or food or markets carried on by any nation or group of nations would in modern times represent the supreme folly. There is no war, nuclear or conventional, by which the victor, so called—assuming there is one—could conceivably win back by war the resources used and destroyed in waging it. If we choose not to listen to the voice of humanity against war, we might at least listen to the voice of common sense and, indeed, ordinary, rational self-interest.
28.	As a major food producer, Australia is. particularly interested in the proposals on food which President Ford [2234th meeting] and Secretary of State Kissinger [2238th meeting] made at this session. Australia undertakes to work constructively and cooperatively towards the implementation of those proposals. Suggestions such as the establishment of an international system of grain reserves are thoroughly commendable, and they deserve our most serious attention.
29.	Of all the changes that have occurred in the international community since the Second World War, none has more profoundly altered the face of the world than the accession to independence by those peoples and States formerly under colonial rule; The process is not yet complete, but we look to a time in the near future when no territory will be controlled against its choice by a metropolitan Power with which it has no geographical, social, racial or cultural affinity. In that regard, we particularly welcome decisions by Portugal about its colonies.
30.	Australia has acted with determination and vigour to apply the relevant Articles of the Charter. Papua New Guinea became self-governing on 1 December 1973. It will become fully independent as soon as the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea decides. We expect that decision soon: Let me emphasize that the decision we await is that of the House of Assembly. The Australian Government made its own decision long ago: we utterly reject a colonial role for Australia. Meanwhile, the Australian Government deals with the Government of Papua New Guinea in all significant respects as that of a nation already independent.
31.	There is to me, I must say, a most satisfying symmetry in the march of events by which Portugal, the West, and Australia, the newest of the colonial Powers, are acting at the same time towards the liquidation of colonialism. Across the distance of more than four centuries the new world in Australia clasps hands with the old in ending a false, demeaning, unworthy power over others. 
32.	The dramatic and welcome progress made towards the dissolution of the oldest and last of the colonial empires now enables the United Nations to direct even more concentrated attention Upon its twin evil, that of racisms particularly in its post-colonial manifestations in southern Africa. We must be unremitting in the efforts sanctioned by the Assembly to break the illegal regime in Rhodesia—Zimbabwe— to end South Africa's unlawful control over Namibia and to end apartheid. We should all make determined efforts to see that the momentum which launched the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination is not lost. <;My Government, conscious that Australia's own record is seriously flawed, is determined to remove all forms of racial discrimination within our own shores—notably now as notoriously in the past, against our own aboriginals.
33.	While racism remains as cruel as any example of man's inhumanity to man, we should not, however, overlook the existence of other forms of discrimination which rob men and women of their right to live in dignity and peace of mind. Throughout the world, political prisoners languish in gaols or are otherwise deprived of their civil liberties. There are thoroughly unacceptable constraints on the right of political asylum. Religious and ethnic minorities are persecuted, workers are denied the protection of conventions of ILO and women are denied equal opportunities. Even in the General Assembly women are scarcely equally represented. The Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Willesee, will during the discussion be submitting Australia's views and proposals on these matters.
34.	There has never been a time in human history when the truth of the oneness, the indivisibility, of humanity has been so manifest. It is no longer only a philosophical or religious proposition, but an assertion of sheer reason and commanding common sense. All the momentous recent developments have profound implications for the future conduct of international relations, since they have one common theme: the interdependence of us all. That interdependence is now almost total.
35.	An attempt by any State to bring about political or economic change in another through unconstitutional, clandestine, corrupt methods, by assassination or terrorism, undermines the rule of international law, encourages adventurism and anarchy, endangers world peace, and turns quite quickly against even the most powerful nations that would seek to advance their cause by such methods.	
36.	Unwilful erection of trade barriers by one State or group of States without regard to the hardship caused to others can create economic dislocation around the world by curtailing or closing export markets to which their industries have become geared and on which their foreign exchange earnings depend.
37.	A refusal to recognize the inalienable rights of all peoples to freedom and independence produces tension and conflict, not only between the oppressed and the oppressors, but between them and other nations which become associated or involved in these just and legitimate struggles.
38.	Now more than ever we look to the United Nations. It has the experience, the stature and the capacity to help us identify the sources of tension between nations, to prescribe collective measures to mitigate and eventually to remove* the causes of conflict, and to anticipate and prevent situations developing that have the potential for disturbing world peace.
39.	It is claimed that the world is now short of leadership. It is truer to say that the nature, complexity and universality of the problems rushing in upon us render irrelevant and obsolete that concept of world leadership whereby a handful of powerful men in charge of the most powerful nations can chart the course for the rest of us to follow. So the challenge for the United Nations to provide a genuine and continuing source of leadership, of hope and purpose for the world is more urgent, the opportunity more real, than at any time in the history of the Organization. In the response we make here to that challenge, we shall be judged —as nations, as representatives of our nations, and as men and women—not by our power or size or wealth but by the honesty of our efforts to promote and to practise the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
5363,70,2015,MHL,"I bring the General Assembly the warm greetings of “Yokwe” from the people and nation of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer small island States a powerful tool with which to shape and adjust our own domestic strategies. The international community has spoken, and a changing world is mapping a visionary landscape that reaches into the distant years that have too rarely been part of our own national discussions — beyond 2020, beyond 2023, towards 2030 and even farther, to the middle of the century.
In adopting the SDGs, the Marshall Islands cannot afford a set-it-and-forget-it mentality, which has too often marked past international efforts. We now have a powerful opportunity in which to merge recent national planning improvements and construct an architecture for measuring progress and pinpointing gaps. Such gaps are not only our own, but also those of our partners. Too often, we have — all of us — operated with goodwill, but without accountability for our collective performance. Our post-2023 national trust fund deserves a strong support system and also represents an opportunity, if we use it, to work towards specific goals and benchmarks. If we can jointly harness our national and global priorities, if we can commit our own efforts and national resources, however small they may be right now, and if our close partners can work with us to restructure assistance-delivery to target the SDGs, then my nation too can climb the development ladder.
I welcome the establishment of a comprehensive assistance programme with the International Atomic Energy Agency that will not only enhance our national
20/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
capacity to monitor and evaluate serious issues of nuclear contamination but that will also address health strategies and other key SDG benchmarks.
The Marshall Islands faces some of the more complex development, security and planning challenges in the world, but we lack the full tools available to tackle them. A nation struggling to attain basic social development goals will not be equipped to resolve any other challenge.
Progress in education is key. Firm efforts are under way to correct our course and to provide better opportunities for our youngest and future generations. We have found new pathways for building on our traditional knowledge and culture to enable our education system to draw on our own Pacific story and strength. But our efforts and good intentions alone cannot ensure that every willing student has an opportunity to succeed. We need international support.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has one of the world’s highest rates of diabetes, which has led my Government to declare a state of emergency. Non-communicable diseases remain a primary threat to our national well-being. Without transformative partnerships, and without extending more closely to our shores the renewed United Nations 2008-2013 Action Plan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, we risk a tragic downward spiral.
The term developing nation implies forward movement, yet for far too long the Marshall Islands has been only treading water. We have promising opportunities and aspirations for improving our investment platforms, but our untapped yet substantial resource base is often coloured by larger international influence.
Our fisheries represent not only a vital sector for our own development, but also a wider contribution to international food security, because the Pacific is steward of half the world’s commercial tuna. Our foreign fishing nation partners, who not by accident are also the drivers of global influence, have held the purse to our own future for far too long. Key stocks in the Pacific are being plundered at unsustainable rates that jeopardize our future.
Already, higher returns from foreign licenses have benefited our own national fiscal future, yet that is only a fraction of the true potential. It is unacceptable that,
on the one hand, we are expected to achieve the SDGs and to demonstrate dramatic development progress while, on the other hand, we are blocked from further gains from our own resources by the self-interests of distant fishing nations.
The Marshall Islands and the States parties to the Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of Common Interest remain firmly committed to the benefits of the Vessel Day Scheme and targeted high seas closures as a condition for fishing our waters. The tables have turned and, if others wish to fish our waters, they must now do so on our own sovereign terms.
As a low-lying island nation with no higher ground, climate change poses a severe threat to our security. Some have said that there is no more hope and no more time. I forcefully disagree. The future of my nation — the future of our very land — may rest more in the hands of my fellow world leaders than in my own. There is still hope — hope that my nation will be able to tackle the most difficult planning challenges and to build resilience wherever we can, and hope that the world will not turn a blind eye. I can assure the United Nations that the Marshall Islands refuses the very notion that we would willingly relocate wholesale to another country, or resign ourselves to saying that if the water comes, it comes.
As we move to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later this year, in Paris, I am proud that climate change is now recognized by all world leaders as a reality that deserves, and is receiving, a firm and collective response. Everyone must act. Many, including my own nation, have already committed to emissions cuts well into the future of 2025, 2030 and beyond. But the world’s initial efforts are falling significantly short. Instead of indifference or fumbled excuses, we must achieve true leadership that provides a direct response to closing the global emissions gap.
As the broader United Nations debates Security Council reform to adjust it the modern world, the nations that portray themselves as deserving leaders have an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their leadership by not ducking the bill or pointing fingers, but by embracing the challenge of the global emissions gap. They should begin to speak about opportunities for new forms of energy, instead of dancing around perceived threats to growth. For the island nations, a

world without a true commitment to decarbonization and meaningful strategies for its attainment is ultimately no world at all.
As dramatically different as our landscape is today, the tensions of an earlier age continue to resonate, from the time when the Pacific islands region served as the horrific theatre for a global power struggle. Decades later, we again face the complex push-and-pull of larger international politics. Our regional baseline is often one of severe fragility. We have sharp exposure to external shocks, and some of our emerging and future security challenges not only extend beyond our capacity but push the envelope of international precedent.
The treatment of our security as small-island and large ocean nations cannot be considered apart from that of much larger interaction across the Pacific. Some may view political alliances, borders and, in some cases, significant marine mineral resources as mere possessions ready to be plucked by the highest bidder or the strongest military force, just as one might pick ripe fruit from a tree. That contradicts the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.
I offer my firm support for the initiative proposed by New Zealand during its Security Council presidency, when it convened a Council meeting on small island developing States and threats to international peace and security (see S/PV.7499). That meeting revealed issues that slip under the global radar but that cannot be ignored. I urge the Council’s establishment of a regular agenda item on security issues in small island developing States.
I am proud to announce the formal establishment, earlier this week, of diplomatic relations between the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Cuba.
Everyone should participate on the international stage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the specialized agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the UNFCCC. It is imperative that the global community fully recognize and evaluate Taiwan’s important commitment to reduce its emissions. Furthermore, I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, and urge recognition of the important assistance it has provided to my country in the areas of health, education and energy. The Marshall Islands welcomes Taiwan’s efforts as a regional peacemaker, including in cross-
strait issues, and urges that States Members of the United Nations recognize and encourage such progress.
Like many other countries, the Republic of the Marshall Islands believes that awareness of the catastrophic impacts and humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons must underpin all efforts towards nuclear disarmament. As a former United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has a unique legacy shared only by a few other nations. Even while the United Nations was supposed to be furthering our development, 67 nuclear tests were conducted in our nation between 1946 and 1958 by our former administering Power, the United States of America, under our United Nations trusteeship status, including through authorization under two United Nations resolutions. That was the only time the United Nations ever explicitly authorized the use of nuclear weapons, and the results were, and remain, beyond tragic.
If our own past and its contemporary impact continue to bear that heavy burden, the whole world should know our story. I would therefore strongly urge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to include the powerful and specific example of the Marshall Islands and the related role of the United Nations in his statements aimed at encouraging progress on nuclear disarmament and test bans.
It is essential for the survival of humankind that nuclear weapons never be used again under any circumstances. The universal way to accomplish that is through the total elimination of such weapons. I am deeply disappointed that political distractions resulted in the lack of an outcome from the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons earlier this year. It should be our goal as the United Nations not only to stop the spread of nuclear weapons but also to pursue peace and security in a world without them.
This year, I look forward to a truly united United Nations with the courage not only to address the immediate emergencies at hand but also to move us forward into our dynamic century.

5394,70,2015,KIR,"It is an honour and a privilege to address this historic seventieth session of the General Assembly on behalf of the President, the Government and the people of Kiribati. In Kiribati we begin all formal events such as this by conferring blessings on all. I therefore wish to begin by sharing with the Assembly all our traditional Kiribati blessing of peace and good health, “Kam na bane ni Mauri”.
I echo the sentiments conveyed by previous speakers in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session on his election and for presiding over the recently concluded historic Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, held from 25 to 27 September. On his assumption of the presidency for the first year of the implementation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), I wish to assure him of the full support and cooperation of Kiribati. Let me also take this opportunity to acknowledge with appreciation the commendable leadership of his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his stewardship over the past year as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and for guiding the massive task of shaping the recently adopted Agenda.
I also wish to commend the unwavering commitment and hard work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has served as an able navigator of our family ship, steering the United Nations through the diverse and complex realities and the myriad challenges facing our peoples and nations around the world. In particular, I wish to commend his sterling leadership in guiding the development of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, recently adopted by the membership, and his personal unwavering commitment to focusing
global attention on those who are most vulnerable and who are directly targeted by the many major challenges facing us today as a global community.
We meet at a critical time in the history of multilateralism. The global community very recently endorsed a new post-2015 development agenda “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”. We are also celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. In two months, leaders from around the world will meet in Paris for the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to finalize an agreement on climate change. As we celebrate, we should also reflect on the needs of the most fragile and vulnerable peoples and ensure that the premier global Organization remains responsive to them. That will be the real litmus test for its relevance.
If we as a family of nations do not act, if we fail to focus on the challenges faced by those in the front line, whatever those challenges may be, then we would have failed the millions who are looking to the United Nations to assume leadership. I would like to reiterate our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General for his demonstrated commitment and leadership in focusing the attention of the United Nations and the world on such issues as mitigating the plight of the most needy and alleviating poverty, addressing the Ebola pandemic, hearing the views of young people and women and enabling their participation in development, ending gender-based violence, achieving peace and security, and dealing with the question of climate change.
The challenges facing us as we gather again in New York for this historic session are perhaps greater than they were a year ago. Security challenges posed by climate change, conflicts, terrorism, cybercrime, transnational organized crime and the mass movement of refugees now seen in Europe are among the looming challenges that continue to undermine our efforts as a global family to achieve sustainable development, peace and security for our communities.
If we were to ask what the root causes of those major challenges were, we would be able to find many of the answers in the fact that too little attention has been paid to the problems addressed in the Goals recently endorsed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Goals are not new. Most, if not all, are in our national development plans and strategies.

What is new is the global call for the international community to act together to do things differently in order to effect the transformational changes necessary to achieve the prosperous, peaceful, just and equitable societies that will benefit all. That is crucial in an increasingly interdependent world in which decisions made and actions taken in one country will have ripple effects elsewhere in the globe.
But in adopting the new Agenda, we must not leave undone the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Many countries, Kiribati included, do not have a strong scorecard with respect to the implementation of the MDGs, for a compelling reason. We, like all small island developing States, face major challenges in our development efforts, challenges which are well documented and which I will not repeat here. Those challenges are further compounded by climate change.
My people live on low-lying atoll islands that are no higher than 3 metres above sea level. With the changes in our climate system and with sea-level rise, our islands are now facing major challenges never before faced in our history. We have experienced climate extremes, not only from sea-level rise but also from disastrous natural events, such as cyclone Pam which hit Vanuatu and other low-lying Pacific islands, mine included, earlier this year, soon followed by typhoons Maysak and Dolphin.
High tides combined with strong winds wreaked havoc on our islands, our homes, our villages and our people. What is particularly alarming is the increasing frequency and severity of such events. In some parts of the country, whole villages have had to relocate because of severe coastal erosion and flooding. Food crops have been destroyed and the freshwater lakes, our major source of drinking water, are increasingly being contaminated by the intruding seawater. Our people are worried as they watch those events grow in intensity. The most vulnerable are the already vulnerable — women, children, the disabled, the sick and the aged.
All those events have put pressure on our already stressed national systems and limited national resources and will continue to do so. Kiribati and other low-lying atoll countries such as Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Maldives and Tokelau, as well as the millions of people living in coastal areas in the Pacific and around the globe, have first to address the critical and pressing here-and-now challenges from climate change, before
we can even begin to talk of sustainable development or a new development agenda.
The first real test of our commitment to the new development agenda adopted by the international community will be the Paris climate summit. The Sustainable Development Agenda will mean nothing if the Paris climate summit in December fails to come up with an ambitious and legally binding agreement that addresses the predicament of those on the front line of climate change and saves humankind by halting global warming. For us on the front line of climate change, the Paris outcome document must include a long-term temperature goal to limit global average temperature increase to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It must also include provisions on loss and damage as a stand-alone element that is separate and distinct from adaptation.
We must all step up our national and collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse-gas emissions. We must urge major greenhouse-gas emitters to do their part. Last week, my country, one of the countries with the lowest level of emissions, submitted an ambitious intended nationally determined contribution to the UNFCCC secretariat. We must call with urgency on our development partners, on philanthropic partners and on private businesses to assist us on the front line of the climate calamity to deal with the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise now being experienced in our countries and to support our efforts to build the resilience and preparedness of our people as they face an uncertain future. It is high time we recognize that the new challenges require us to draw on all the resources available to the global community and to accept that sustainable development and global challenges such as climate change should not be confined to the sphere of Governments alone.
Let us call on all those with the ability to assist and with a contribution to make to join in the global dialogue and, more important, to take part in urgent action to address this major challenge. Let us bring in our young people, our women, civil society, the private sector, churches, universities, traditional institutions and indigenous populations. Let us bring everyone on board. Let us be inclusive. Let all who have a contribution to make it.
We welcome the inclusive approach taken in developing the post-2015 development agenda. We also welcome the participation of Taiwan in the World
12/18 15-29940

02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27
Health Assembly — for example, its inclusion in the fight against Ebola — and we would like to see a similar inclusive approach prevail in respect of other international institutions and United Nations processes in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and in the call for urgent climate action, where Taiwan and all who can participate and contribute meaningfully for the good of humankind must be brought in to do so. Everyone needs to be brought in.
“Business as usual” can no longer be our approach. Let us not confine ourselves to our comfort zones and our usual economic arguments; let us stop avoiding our political taboos. The challenge of climate change makes a larger demand on us. It requires that we rise above national priorities and think with a global consciousness. We must go outside the bounds of conventional thinking — outside the norm — because the challenge before us is extraordinarily serious and therefore calls for extraordinary and unconventional solutions.
It is most gratifying to note that there is an emerging glimmer of hope, that there is a shift in the wind in the dialogue on climate change. We welcome the opinion of His Holiness Pope Francis on climate change, together with the messages and expressions of commitment from a growing number of quarters, including capitals around the globe and civil society, in which climate change is recognized as posing a major challenge and requiring urgent action. We welcome this most gratifying shift as a very positive development in the right direction, implying that the international community has at last heard our messages and the stories we have shared about the plight of our people.
But hearing our story and recognizing that climate change is a major challenge is not enough; we need to act on it with urgency. We islands may be on the front line, but so are the millions of people around the world living in low-lying areas. They are just as vulnerable. So are the millions of others facing prolonged droughts, higher temperatures and melting glaciers. For them, like us, sustainable development and the recently adopted new Agenda will not mean anything, unless the global community steps up, and steps up substantially, its efforts to combat climate change.
We take full responsibility for the future of our people and we will do our part. In Kiribati, we have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to ensure the survival of our people. We have bought land offshore. We have
looked at floating and artificial islands and options for raising our islands from their current heights to heights above the predicted sea-level rises. We have embarked on a major education reform programme designed to upgrade the skills of our people in line with our programme on migration with dignity.
But we cannot do it alone. There needs to be a collective global effort. We call for new and accessible financial resources to assist the most vulnerable to adapt and build resilience to climate change. We welcome the continued assistance of our partners, including Taiwan, but much, much more needs to be done. While it is commendable that there have been significant pledges for the Green Climate Fund, there remain the challenge of accessibility and the translation of these pledges into contributions where they matter the most. We welcome the assistance provided by various agencies with the capacity to provide the needed conduit, but it is equally important that such assistance not get eroded in the process.
In celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the united family of nations, we must have confidence that, as we pledge in the preamble to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, no member nation will be left behind. It is simply not sufficient to acknowledge that climate change is an existential challenge. It is about our response as the global community and what actions we take as a community of moral human beings.
I reiterate that the real test of the effectiveness and relevance of the new Sustainable Development Agenda, and indeed the relevance of the united family of nations as it celebrates its seventieth anniversary, is in ensuring that no one is left behind. Yet my people and those on the front line of climate change face the real possibility of being left behind. I therefore call on the General Assembly to lend its support to the voice of the most vulnerable and call on the international community to craft an ambitious legally binding agreement that can begin to heal our one shared home and planet. I further call on the General Assembly to join those on the front line of climate change in requesting the Conference of the Parties in Paris to agree that the increase in global average temperature should be held below 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The climate agreement must also include provisions on loss and damage and, most important, a special mechanism to fast-track urgent assistance to the millions of people who are at the front line of climate change and who need that assistance immediately.
"
5432,70,2015,NRU,"It is an honour to be here for the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. I can only marvel at the scale of that accomplishment. Not only has this institution grown from its original 51 Members to its current 193, but it has also expanded its work to take on a remarkable number of issues facing the world. Our debate here provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on what has made the Organization so successful.
I believe the reason for that success can be summed up in a single word: legitimacy. Only with legitimacy can we expect leaders from around the world to gather here every September. Only with legitimacy can we expect the agreements we reach here to be implemented
in the real world. However, legitimacy is a fragile thing. It takes decades to build, but can be lost in the blink of an eye. Therefore, preserving and strengthening the legitimacy of this institution must be at the centre of our work if the United Nations is to remain a powerful force for progressive change in the world.
Therefore, to strengthen the legitimacy of the United Nations, I propose that the road ahead be guided by three principles: universality, adaptability and accountability. We took an important step in that direction last week with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which demonstrates our ability to learn from past experience and create an approach that is better tailored to the needs and circumstances of all nations.
The Agenda places the welfare of human beings at its core and lays out a comprehensive set of Goals and targets to help empower every individual to realize his or her full potential. This moves us away from looking at single indicators like gross domestic product or income per capita to measure human progress and focuses our work on building a more robust foundation for sustainability and prosperity. Education, public health, gender equality, clean water, oceans, energy and, more importantly, a strong family unit — those are some of the blocks on which our future must be built.
For my country, the ocean is the source of almost all development possibilities. Unlike large countries, we do not have a diversified portfolio of industries. Phosphate mining and fishing constitute the large bulk of economic possibilities for Nauru, along with less than a handful of other sources of income. It is all the more concerning, therefore, when vessels come to our waters and engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Regional estimates put earnings lost to IUU at anywhere from millions to over $1 billion. For economies like ours, those numbers are staggering, and if we are to be true to the 2030 Agenda and the commitments made to the small island developing States, we must do much more to eliminate IUU fishing and ensure that the income from fishing goes to the rightful resource owners.
That and other issues from the 2030 Agenda will require us to rethink the way we cooperate at the international level. Our international and regional bodies must be fit for purpose. The universality of that endeavour will require them to respect national differences and move away from one-size-fits-all
15-29568 15/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
strategies. Thematic silos must be replaced by cross- cutting networks. Implementing agencies at every level must become both more nimble and more robust.
All partnerships — whether multilateral, bilateral or public-private — must be based on mutual respect that recognizes genuine development partners, such as the Republic of China on Taiwan, a democracy that can contribute meaningfully towards development and prosperity in the world. Needless to say, Taiwanese technology and know-how can make a lot of difference towards helping the needy, and, as such, I call for the inclusion of Taiwan in the development agencies of the United Nations.
Aid must be predictable and sustainable, It should not be wielded as a weapon to advance partisan political ends. Predatory relationships that pit one group against another have no place in the 2030 Development Agenda. History has demonstrated that openness and engagement have proven far more effective strategies for positive change than isolation and exclusion. Only in such an environment can we hold one another accountable for the full implementation of the Agenda.
That is the vision that Nauru has embraced for the 2030 Agenda, and back home we are taking steps to move forward. Like the United Nations itself, we will need to build strong domestic institutions to achieve our goals. Their legitimacy will similarly rest on their inclusiveness, adaptability and accountability. Therefore, in implementing the 2030 Agenda, we must go beyond capacity-building. We must engage in the difficult task of institution-building. International and regional agencies and development partners should back those efforts with real resources that include long- term, in-country engagement when appropriate, so that they leave behind durable domestic institutions run by a skilled national workforce.
Nauru is asking for a lot from its development partners. We want to be better partners ourselves. And at the end of the day, implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda will happen mostly at national and local level. On that note, let me thank our partners Australia, Taiwan, Russia, Cuba and others for their support towards our sustainable development priorities.
Our efforts to improve the legitimacy of international institutions must extend beyond those most directly involved in the 2030 Development Agenda. The Security Council in particular must better reflect the geopolitical realities of the world today.
Therefore, the list of permanent and non-permanent members should be expanded. We support the inclusion of Germany, India, Japan, Brazil and others in the permanent category. In addition, the Security Council must continue to adapt and respond to the most pressing issues of today. That is why Nauru calls on it to make climate change a permanent agenda item. It should be supplemented by the appointment by the Secretary- General of a Special Representative on climate and security. In addition, relevant organs of the United Nations should assess their capacity to respond to the security implications of climate change.
The governance of the Bretton Woods institutions should also be made more representative, with developing countries given a greater presence. The global economy has become more reliant on the flow of international capital, and with the frequency of financial crises increasing, the legitimacy of those institutions will continue to be tested.
However, climate change will be the largest test of our international and domestic institutions. We have already seen how some climate impacts can overwhelm the capacity of even the most powerful among us. Clearly, a strong, legally binding agreement in Paris is absolutely critical, with ambitious mitigation contributions from all countries. The agreement should be guided by a temperature-increase goal of 1.5°C, consistent with our vision of a safe and secure world. It must also ensure that climate financing is available for adaptation, particularly for the most vulnerable countries. And for dealing with the impacts that exceed our adaptation efforts, it should anchor an international mechanism on loss and damage.
The United Nations was created
“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind”.
At present, climate change, if left unaddressed, promises impacts no less catastrophic for many of our nations.
Today marks the lead-up to a very important milestone in my people’s history — the seventieth anniversary of our return home. During the occupation of my country in the Second World War, Nauruans were forcibly evacuated to what is now Chuuk state in the Federated States of Micronesia. Due to widespread food shortages and the harsh conditions imposed by our
16/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
captors, our population fell to below 1,500. We were in danger of extinction. Nauruans know very well what happens to small, vulnerable countries when the big ones fail to address their problems in a responsible manner.
I strongly believe that many of the major economic Powers want to reach an agreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris. Many have already come forward with meaningful mitigation contributions that will certainly require a great deal of effort to achieve. While we know it is not enough, I do not doubt their sincerity. However, I am starting to doubt whether they are willing and able to make the fundamental changes in their political and economic systems required to achieve our ambitious goals. The intense lobbying to accept an unsatisfactory outcome has already begun, and in the international process, that has often meant that we will be presented with a take-it-or-leave it deal at COP21. Would such an agreement have any legitimacy? Can we solve the climate problem without it?
The number 70 has biblical significance in the Christian faith, as it is composed of the numbers 7 and 10. The number 7 often represents the concept of completeness, while the number 10 often refers to law and responsibility. It is fitting that during the seventieth session of the General Assembly we will complete our work on a new set of global agreements to tackle the challenges of our generation. The number 70 can also represent a period of judgement. We stand at a critical moment in history as civilization outstrips the natural boundaries of our planet. Our response during the next few years will determine the fate of future generations for the next thousand years. Will we continue to march to an inexorable decline? Or will we join together to meet the challenges before us? Thankfully, we still have a choice ,and the widespread recognition of the need for change I have heard during the past week gives me hope that we will make the right one.
May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations.
"
5436,70,2015,AUS,"We meet this day at an important time for the United Nations, 70 years after its foundation. Australia’s representative to the San Francisco Conference in 1945 described the General Assembly as the place where the conscience of the peoples of the world should have its most potent expression. It is appropriate then, here in the General Assembly Hall, to reflect on what the United Nations has achieved and what it needs to achieve for the future.
The United Nations provides critical services each and every day in many parts of the world. Often this important work goes unnoticed or unappreciated by those not in direct receipt of that support. Australia recognizes the dedicated, often courageous work of the thousands of United Nations personnel in the field who protect vulnerable citizens, deliver vital humanitarian assistance, rebuild damaged societies and support development. The United Nations carries out its work in an increasingly hostile environment.
Today the world faces an unprecedented number of long-running and seemingly intractable conflicts, generating displacement on a massive scale and making humanitarian need more dire than at any time since the Second World War. Terrorism today is a global threat. The magnitude of the development challenge is immense. However, we must acknowledge the remarkable achievement that is the United Nations Charter. The values and aspirations articulated seven decades ago still guide us today.
Australia is proud that, as an active participant at the San Francisco Conference, we crafted a central element of the Charter, Article 56, known as the Australia Pledge. Under that Article, United Nations Members pledge to take action individually and jointly to promote higher standards of living; solutions to international economic, social, health and related problems; and universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Australia took that pledge on signing the Charter in 1945. Today I reiterate that pledge.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), adopted unanimously last Friday by the General Assembly, is a manifestation of the
16/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
Australia Pledge and a testament to the fundamental role of the Organization. Only the United Nations could have produced this remarkable result. The Sustainable Development Goals are necessarily ambitious. Let us consider just the first five: to end extreme poverty everywhere; to end hunger; to ensure quality education; to ensure healthy lives; and to achieve gender equality. Should we realize all 17 Goals, we will transform our world for the betterment of humankind.
We must ensure that the remarkable spirit of cooperation displayed during the negotiation process is maintained as we work to turn these ambitious goals into reality. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that economic growth, including through private-sector investment and trade, is central to sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda also recognizes that while official development assistance remains important, it is only one source of financing for development. The 2030 Agenda affirms that it is the quality of assistance that matters, and that true partnerships for development are essential, based on respect and cooperation. That is what Australia seeks to achieve with our friends and neighbours in the Pacific.
Climate change is a challenge for all nations and decisive action is required. We will succeed in reducing global emissions only if there is engagement by the entire United Nations membership. Australia has announced a strong, responsible and achievable post- 2020 contribution to international climate action. We are committed to ensuring the United Nations Climate Conference in Paris at the end of the year is the platform needed to secure a collective approach to the below 2° goal.
There is an inescapable truth. We cannot transform our world unless the place of women within it is transformed. The 2030 Agenda requires us to achieve nothing less than full gender equality. This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. It is essential to achieve sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth. Australia has established a $50 million gender equality fund to accelerate support for gender equality in our development programme delivered in our region, the Indian Ocean/Asia-Pacific.
We must step up the fight against the global scourge of violence against women and girls.
Last week the Australian Government announced a new domestic policy, a $100 million women’s safety package, improving front-line support services
and providing educational resources to help change community attitudes to violence and abuse. Similarly, our overseas aid programme helps countries in our region in efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls. The United Nations women, peace and security agenda has changed our collective thinking on the role of women in conflict. We now need to put it into practice. That is why Australia has worked with the United States to produce the first military commanders’ guide for implementing women, peace and security in the field.
A key element of the 2030 Agenda is that peaceful and inclusive societies are essential to achieving sustainable development. Human rights, good governance and open and inclusive institutions are crucial foundations for development. Human rights have been at the very centre of the United Nations over the past 70 years, from the United Nations Charter in 1945 to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015.
With the rise of terrorist groups like Daesh, the continuing depredations of the North Korean regime, and the persistence of forced labour and other contemporary forms of slavery, the need for the United Nations to prosecute a strong human rights agenda has never been more pressing or urgent. Australia is standing for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term. This is the first time that my country has sought election to that body. I believe that Australia would bring to the Human Rights Council the same principled and practical approach that distinguished our 2013-2014 Security Council term. Should we be elected, our focus would be on empowering women and girls, strengthening governance and democratic institutions, promoting freedom of expression and advancing human rights for all.
Australia would be at the forefront of efforts to hold to account those responsible for human rights abuses and to build more effective preventative and accountability measures. We would be unrelenting in our efforts to secure abolition of the death penalty. Our term on the Human Rights Council would reflect Australia’s inclusive, diverse society and build on the Australian Government’s strong domestic human rights agenda.
There are nations for which the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda, indeed the promises of the United Nations Charter, appear remote or unachievable. The scourge of war continues to tear apart families, communities, countries and entire regions. As a non-permanent
15-29595 17/23

A/70/PV.18 29/09/2015
member of the Security Council, we experienced first- hand the difficulties the Council faces in responding to the crises and conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Mali. Nowhere is the devastation greater than in Iraq and Syria. Daesh is wreaking unspeakable havoc and harm on individuals, families and communities and destroying the world’s cultural heritage in gross violation of international law and against the fundamental concepts of morality. It cannot be allowed to prevail.
Australia is participating in coalition military action to combat Daesh in Iraq and Syria. We are doing so within the framework of the Charter and in a manner consistent with international law. Defeating Daesh requires both military and political action. Reconciliation and inclusive governance in Iraq are the key to reducing Daesh’s appeal and support. We continue to advocate a political solution that can bring an end to the conflict in Syria and we support United Nations Envoy Staffan de Mistura’s efforts towards that end.
We do not believe any transition option should be rejected. All permutations of a political solution should be assessed with clear-eyed realism. Australia is committed to defeating terrorism in all its forms. We are responding to the challenges of violent extremism and foreign terrorist fighters, taking on those who would exploit our openness and modern communications to commit violence and promote terror. The humanitarian consequences of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq are devastating. I commend neighbouring countries Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, which continue to bear the brunt of the population of displaced persons. Australia has provided $230 million in humanitarian assistance since the start of the conflict.
The massive flows of displaced people across the Middle East and into Europe have stretched response capacities to a breaking point. In this environment, people smugglers will strive to prosper from their dangerous and criminal trade. Australia’s firm response to people smuggling, and continued cooperation with its regional partners, have saved the lives of thousands who would otherwise have succumbed to the false promises of people smugglers. It has also enabled us to give refuge to those most in need. Consistent with our record over decades of resettling permanently thousands of refugees, Australia was pleased to announce recently that we would resettle permanently an additional 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq — registered by
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — particularly those who are unlikely to have a home to which they might return. We also announced $44 million in funding to support 240,000 displaced persons on the borders.
The global humanitarian system is struggling to cope with the escalating demands. The World Humanitarian Summit in May next year must deliver a nimble humanitarian system which responds to different types of humanitarian crises in the most effective fashion. The only long-term solution to these man-made crises is a political one — to bring these conflicts to an end.
Australia’s recent experience as a Security Council member confirmed that the Council’s role is more essential than ever. The Security Council can perform its role only if it has the tools it needs. The role of peacekeeping is fundamental. Yesterday, I joined others in pledging renewed operational support for the United Nations peacekeeping system. Australian airlift was vital to the United Nations early response to the South Sudan crisis. We have now pledged to provide our C-17 Globemasters and C-130 Hercules aircraft to help United Nations peacekeepers respond to crises where and whenever we can in the future.
We recognize that the United Nations needs more tools for peacebuilding to help vulnerable States emerge from crises and prevent them from falling back into violence and disorder. Australia is looking forward to co-chairing with Angola the consultations on the peacebuilding architecture review later this year. We need to strengthen this crucial element of conflict prevention.
Another central lesson from Australia’s term on the Council was that accountability is crucial in preventing cycles of violence. The International Criminal Court has a critical role to play and requires our support. Australia remains determined to hold to account those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 in July 2014. We owe nothing less to the families of those aboard that fateful flight. We will not let a Russian veto impede the efforts of countries grieving the loss of their citizens and demanding justice for the perpetrators of this atrocity.
All States must uphold their responsibility to protect civilians from the most serious international crimes. Security Council members have a particular responsibility to do so. In that context, we welcome
18/23 15-29595

29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18
proposals to restrain use of the veto where mass atrocity crimes are being committed. Australia’s term on the Security Council in 2013-2014 demonstrated that elected members can play an active and constructive role. I am therefore pleased to announce that Australia is nominating itself to serve again on the Council for the 2029-2030 term.
We do not underestimate the challenges facing all of us. Equally we should not downplay the opportunities. We remain confident that working together we can realize the enduring promise of the Charter — for Australians, for our region, and for the international community. And now 70 years on, the General Assembly is indeed the place where the conscience of the peoples of the world has its most potent expression.
"
5445,70,2015,PNG,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, I congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session on his election. We also pay tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, Foreign Minister of Uganda, for his able leadership as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and for steering the course for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. Furthermore, we extend our gratitude to the Secretary- General for his unfailing commitment and visionary leadership of the United Nations, thereby ensuring that the spirit of the Charter remains an enduring pillar for our collective well-being as we retool it to meet the emerging challenges and opportunities of the twenty- first century and beyond.
We commend the theme of the general debate, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”, and pledge our support to the presidency in ensuring the effective implementation of the transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) that was adopted unanimously a few days ago. As Papua New Guinea celebrates its fortieth year of nationhood, we also join the United Nations family this
year in marking the founding of the United Nations 70 years ago. My Government is committed to working in close partnership with all stakeholders to implement the post-2015 development agenda, which in turn must be nationally owned and driven.
We can succeed only when countries truly own and lead their national development plans and strategies, while integrating the 2030 Agenda. Consistent with its 2014 national strategy for responsible sustainable development, Papua New Guinea recognizes that a healthy, well-educated population is the underlying driver for development.
The principle of responsible, sustainable development means that we do not conduct ourselves in a manner that will compromise future generations. The high-level political forum must support national, regional and global efforts with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and avoid issues such as those that undermined the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development. The Government of Papua New Guinea has adopted enabling national policies, strategies and plans to provide an environment conducive to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and the SDGs. Those policies cover the areas of population, water and sanitation, hygiene, free basic health services and tuition-free education. The free-education policy has led to the enrolment in schools of an additional 2 million children in the past two years.
Papua New Guinea has laid a strong foundation for development in the past decade. This has resulted in unprecedented economic growth, which reached double digits in 2012. However, the current depression in international commodity prices and stock markets has negatively impacted the country’s economic performance. We are taking steps to ensure that the recent adverse conditions do not jeopardize the positive gains made in the past 10 years. Papua New Guinea is part of the global economy and, as such, seeks a stable, equitable international economic and financial architecture to support our efforts in advancing human development. The challenge for Papua New Guinea is to translate enhanced economic growth and other transformations into improved practical human development outcomes, in order to achieve our National Vision 2050. That should then result in the achievement of the SDGs.
As we gather here today, there are many conflicts worldwide, with millions of people displaced and forced
22/26 15-29876

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24
to leave their homes under risky conditions, in search of safety and security. Threats to peace and security hinder the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Those security concerns, including transnational crime and international terrorism, if not adequately contained, will have proliferating cross-border effects on global peace, stability and economic prosperity, including for us in the Pacific Islands region. Papua New Guinea echoes the calls on all conflicting parties to amicably discuss and resolve their differences under the mandate of the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to maintaining global peace and security.
Papua New Guinea is proud to contribute to the United Nations and regional peacekeepers in South Sudan and Darfur. We hope to increase our deployment numbers as our economy grows.
The global refugee crisis has reached Papua New Guinea. We have received refugees and asylum seekers since independence. We are currently working closely with the Government of Australia by providing an asylum-seeker processing facility and contributing to finding lasting solutions to the global challenge. We strongly believe that it is high time for the global community to seriously address the root causes of the refugee situation and the forced displacement of people and families.
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons remains a serious threat to national and global peace, security and development. In that light, Papua New Guinea has prioritized policy initiatives and programmes to curb the importation and trading of firearms.
Papua New Guinea reaffirms its commitment to upholding and protecting fundamental human rights. Our national population policy 2015-2024 recognizes that human rights are closely intertwined with sustainable development.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. This global mechanism is essential, given the increasing frequency and severity of climate-induced natural disasters, particularly in our Pacific islands region. Recognizing the need for better preparation for timely responses to disasters and crisis situations, the Pacific subregional grouping — the Melanesian Spearhead Group — is in the process of establishing a humanitarian and emergency technical response coordination centre. We welcome technical
and capacity-building assistance from the international community to support our efforts, as provided for under international agreements, including the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway.
The world has changed since the formation of the United Nations 70 years ago. The current United Nations system requires urgent reform, and we support the efforts of the Secretary-General in that regard. On Security Council reform, we welcome the General Assembly’s recent adoption of decision 69/560, on equitable distribution and representation in the Council’s membership. Additionally, Papua New Guinea supports the initiative to review the use of the veto power in the Security Council, particularly during times of grave humanitarian crisis and mass atrocities.
In the regional context, we are fully supportive of the 2014 Pacific Islands Forum reforms, whereby a new regional development road map — the Framework for Pacific Regionalism — was adopted to promote greater regional cooperation, integration and connectivity. Through this Framework, Papua New Guinea committed $100 million for 2014-2018 to its regional outreach programme, to support Pacific SIDS in critical areas of development such as good governance, education, health, capacity-building, climate change, relief assistance and natural disaster reconstruction efforts.
Our assistance to Pacific SIDS exemplifies and promotes the spirit of South-South cooperation, and we encourage others to join us in similar partnerships. In that respect, Papua New Guinea has made modest financial contributions to Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Niue, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, as well as to various regional entities including the Pacific Islands Forum, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme and the Melanesian Spearhead Group, to add value to regional partnerships.
The Pacific region continues to attach critical importance to ensuring the sustainable development, management and conservation of the Pacific Ocean for our peoples’ livelihoods, food security and economic development. In this regard, we welcome SDG 14, on conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources. We call upon development partners to assist us in addressing various challenges related to the oceans, including illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing in our territorial waters.

A/70/PV.24 01/10/2015
Climate change poses imminent dangers with wide-ranging implications, including threats not only to human security, survival and development, but also to the entire global ecosystem. Our Climate Change Management Act is possibly the first legislation of its kind in the Pacific islands. It provides for funding arrangements to assist in the adaptation to climate change.
Along with other Pacific island States, Papua New Guinea looks forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris and hopes that a new comprehensive and legally binding climate agreement will be adopted to set the schedules for the reduction of carbon emissions from both the developed and developing world. The most imminent threat resulting from sea level rise due to climate change is the forced displacement of populations and complete inundation and loss of sovereign territories, particularly in Pacific small island developing States. We therefore call on the Security Council to deal decisively with the implications of climate change and security issues.
The recent Pacific Island Forum summit in Port Moresby adopted the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action. Leaders were deeply concerned about the serious effects and impacts of climate change, particularly on national and regional development and security issues. Among other things, the Pacific island leaders declared that an increase of 1.5°C would severely exacerbate the particular challenges facing the most vulnerable smaller island States of the Pacific and urged that all efforts be made to keep us within the global temperature goal, as noted by the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC at its twentieth session, in its decision 1/CP.20.
The 2015 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Declaration on Climate Change Action also expresses an expectation that there will be access to financial resources for climate change actions and resilience in vulnerable developing countries; recognition of the special circumstances and vulnerability of SIDS, particularly those in the Pacific, and the least developed countries (LDCs); support for inclusion in the Paris outcome document of loss and damage as a critical and stand-alone element, building on the ongoing work of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; and finally, recognition of impacts of climate change on women and youth, the
elderly, the disabled, indigenous peoples and other vulnerable and marginalized groups, acknowledging their contributions to effective implementation of the Paris outcome document.
Let us not leave anyone — particularly those of us in SIDS and LDCs — behind, drowning. We must strive to come together in accordance with the rule of law for a better, more secure and prosperous world.
"
5448,70,2015,PLW,"On behalf of President Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the Republic of Palau, I have the honour to make the following remarks before the General Assembly at its seventieth session.
At the outset, Palau would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to lead our work during the seventieth session. We pledge our support for the work ahead. May we also take the opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his sterling leadership during the sixty-ninth session.
We meet here today in perilously challenging, yet still hopeful, times. The principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are more critical to our common future than ever before. We must not only reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, but also redouble our efforts to uphold those rights. Our collective determination to promote social progress and better standards of living must be matched by our on-the-ground partnerships to fight poverty, protect the most vulnerable among us and protect the one planet we call home.
So while the challenges — violence and war, poverty and disease, rising seas and wildfires as well as droughts caused by climate change — are enormous, so too is the resolve that I share with all here today to make good on our commitment to transforming our world through the urgent and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).
I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General, the co-facilitators and the thousands of people whose dedicated work made the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 Agenda a strong set of imperatives for transformational change that all of our peoples so urgently need to preserve our cultures, our economies and our environment and to ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for our children.
Let me also briefly express my President’s sorrow at the plight of the countless refugees who are seeking havens of peace and prosperity for themselves and for their families as they search for refuge and protection away from their motherlands, which have been torn by strife that was sparked and worsened by internal conflict and/or environmental degradation and climate change.
The theme of the general debate at the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”, is very appropriate for this year’s high-level event, the United Nations Summit for the adoption of the new post- 2015 development agenda. It took place just before the
24/33 15-29946

03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28
general debate and adopted resolution 70/1, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, containing the Sustainable Development Goals.
Just prior to the Summit, His Holiness Pope Francis addressed the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3), reiterating the theme of his papal encyclical, Laudato si’, wherein he criticized the careless use of our planet’s resources leading to environmental degradation and global warming. Let his commentaries serve as an inspiration to us all that will change hearts, minds and actions for a better future that will focus the world’s attention on the most vulnerable among us and on our Mother Earth.
My friends, we can only hope that a generation from now, this session of the General Assembly will be remembered as the defining event when the nations of the world decided, with the greatest resolve, to reverse the tide of the unchecked development and exploitation of our planet and redouble their efforts to end poverty and protect the most vulnerable among us and truly committed to transformative action.
Fifteen years ago, 189 nations and 23 international organizations committed to moving forward with the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Goals served as the framework for a new global commitment to reducing extreme poverty, improving health, enhancing environmental sustainability and addressing gender equality. We now know that progress towards achieving these Goals has been impressive but uneven. Our work to augment these Goals and adopt a new set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals reflects a very clear recognition that the results of the MDGs would have been more impressive had they addressed the underlying causes of poverty and environmental degradation, and had Goal 8, on partnerships, been better realized.
Through 15 years of experience, we now recognize that it is only through international cooperation and partnership with a wide variety of stakeholders that we can scale up the urgent action needed to realize the full potential of sustainable development for our people and for the oceans, forests and coastal areas that sustain our cultures and livelihoods. I am hopeful that now, in 2015, we will all embrace the overarching goal represented by the new Sustainable Development Goals, that is, our commitment to revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.
The third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa in July, was the first test of the degree of commitment on the part of the developed countries to endowing the new sustainable development agenda with the means needed to meet the new proposed level of ambition. Unfortunately, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda merely reiterated, by and large, the commitments made to the outgoing agenda of the Millennium Development Goals and failed to bridge the gap between grand speech-making and down-to- earth expanded financial commitments.
A more ambitious and reinvigorated global partnership is clearly required. The annual report of the MDG Gap Task Force, including the recently released 2015 report, highlighted several shortfalls in international efforts to achieve the MDGs and provided sobering reminders of the need to substantially step up efforts to meet long-standing international commitments.
Over four and a half decades ago, the international community committed to transferring 0.7 per cent of the gross national income of the rich countries to the poorer countries in the form of official development assistance. To date, the rich nations of the world have generally fallen short of that commitment. In the coming decades, affordable and equitable access to technology will be ever more critical if we are to attain the designated levels of human progress and sustainable development in many areas, including enhancing food security, improving health, including mental health and well-being, and preventing non-communicable diseases. Technology will be the bedrock for aggressive action in climate-change mitigation and adaptation, which remain urgent.
Let me reiterate an important point. If our collective will to implement the 2030 Agenda is sincere, then it is essential to greatly enhance the means and mechanisms of implementation on a much greater scale than those recommended in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. That is the only way to achieve the promise of a more inclusive and sustainable world free from hunger and where poverty is eradicated. Let me say it again. That will be achieved only through expanded, genuine and durable partnerships.
Fortunately, my country has a history of strong partnerships. The United States continues to support Palau in its development and movement toward economic independence. We continue to be strong friends, and
15-29946 25/33

A/70/PV.28 03/10/2015
we recognize the unique relationship that we share. We look forward to completing our Compact of Free Association agreement with the United States, which reflects that close and special relationship. We wish to express our special gratitude to the United States and our many other global partners for their support of Goal 14, on oceans, and for the ongoing support towards the preservation of our largest global resource through the set-aside of 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine protected areas. Finally, we thank the United States for its continued and increased assistance to Palau’s expanded marine surveillance and enforcement efforts. That is critical if we are to successfully protect the proposed new Palau National Marine Sanctuary.
Palau would also like to acknowledge the great friendship that it has with Japan and the very significant economic support that we have received from Japan over the years. We also wish to express our sincere gratitude for Japan’s generous support and enhanced public and private assistance to our marine surveillance and enforcement efforts. We continue to express our support for the expansion and reform of the Security Council and for Japan’s permanent membership in the Council.
Palau would also like to thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic support in assisting Palau to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Palau also wishes to recognize Taiwan’s commitment to lowering carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. We urge the United Nations system to involve Taiwan in the process of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Additionally, we advocate in favour of Taiwan’s participation in the relevant international environmental mechanisms, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taiwan possesses technical capacities in many areas that can be shared with the world. It should therefore also participate in other international meetings, mechanisms and frameworks such as the World Health Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, among others.
The success and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals will rest, in great part, on the strength of partnerships, which means inclusion rather than exclusion. Taiwan has been a valuable partner to Palau in achieving our MDGs, and we look forward
to our continued partnership with that country as we embark upon the great challenge of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We would like to express our special gratitude to India for its recent efforts to expand relations with the Pacific Community and to enhance regional cooperation aimed at achieving mutual goals of environmental recovery and economic development. Palau reiterates its support for the reform of the Security Council so as to allow the Council to reflect more closely the issues of today’s world, including the security needs and concerns of the Asia-Pacific region. In that respect, expanding the permanent membership category to include India would be welcome.
Finally, we would like also to recognize the very broad list of partners across the globe that make our efforts towards a sustainable future possible, including the Governments of Australia and New Zealand and the European Union, private organizations, non-governmental organizations and civil society.
With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we have reaffirmed the commitment enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations to fundamental human rights. Inherent in that commitment is an obligation to provide appropriate support for the realization of that commitment. As my President often says, at the end of the day the success of the 2030 Agenda will depend on the strength of the partnerships we develop.
It is now time for the world community to develop those partnerships and, through them, to commit to a much expanded and more accessible financing, technology and human-resource capacity. We must now match our collective determination to promote social progress and better standards of living with on-the-ground partnerships to fight poverty, protect the most vulnerable among us and protect the one planet that we call home.
"
5494,70,2015,VUT,"Vanuatu is honoured to join previous speakers in congratulating the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth session, and I would like to assure him of my delegation’s full support. Under his leadership we are confident that he will guide us successfully through the session. I would also like to offer warm thanks to the previous President of the Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa. His exemplary leadership has produced many important achievements that will continue to shape and strengthen the United Nations and enable it to execute its mandate effectively.
We are meeting today at a critical crossroads in history that presents us with a unique opportunity to change the lives of millions of people around the world, especially the most disadvantaged, for the better. The 2008 world financial crisis dramatically changed the global financial landscape. The banking crisis resulted in unprecedented unemployment and low economic growth around the world. The effects of the financial crisis are still being felt, and the recent volatility of the global financial markets has created further uncertainty.
Apart from that global economic challenge, we are witnessing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis caused by conflict and violence. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are currently more than 60 million refugees in the world, a number unequalled since the Second World
15-29568 29/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
War. Climate change continues to be a major challenge for the world generally, and a major threat to small island developing States (SIDS) in particular. Its impact cannot be understated. The rise in sea levels and the effects of El Niño and unfavourable weather conditions point to a bleak future for humankind.
The uncertain global economic outlook, the adverse impact of climate change and the humanitarian crisis mean that the task ahead of us in implementing the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) is all the more daunting. That stark reality calls for immediate collective action. If we do not resolve this global crisis today, we run the risk of creating a world with no prospect of sustaining peace and security. For the world community, that blunt reality calls for global action to ensure that peace, prosperity and security can continue to be maintained in the future. That is the most important gift we can give our future generations.
I welcome the theme of the General Assembly’s seventieth session, “The United Nations at 70 — the road ahead for peace, security and human rights”. It is timely and relevant to our current global development challenges. Peace, security and human rights are the mutually reinforcing pillars of successful sustainable development and consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. This year we are celebrating the 70 years of the existence of the United Nations, and on reflection, we can see that much has been achieved. We have experienced no major wars so far; millions have been lifted out of extreme poverty and remarkable progress has been made on the human rights front. Despite those achievements, however, significant challenges remain ahead.
The humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the conflict and violence of recent years has revealed a dark side of humankind, a world of haves and have-nots. The major Powers must do more to assist the surging refugee population, and I urge the most financially able countries to seriously consider donating to the coordinated Humanitarian Programme Cycle of the United Nations. What we need now is to address the underlying root causes of such conflicts — extreme poverty, hunger, the lack of good governance, a lack of adherence to the rule of law, poor economic growth, rising inequality and youth unemployment. Sustained and inclusive development is therefore extremely important to preserving peace, human rights and stability around the world. I commend the Secretary-
General’s approach to addressing this humanitarian crisis from a human rights perspective.
In the light of these global challenges, the role of preventive diplomacy as a key instrument in the maintenance of peace and security around the world is critical. Women’s role in this area should be enhanced, and we should focus most of our efforts on preventive diplomacy. Vanuatu will always play its part in maintaining international peace and security, and our deployment of peacekeepers to Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti reflects our commitment to that endeavour.
As part of the international community’s response, we have embarked on three important and ambitious global agendas, adopting the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as drafting an agreement on climate change to be concluded in Paris at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) later this year. The 2030 Agenda promises to be transformative, particularly for those at the margins of society. While the Millennium Development Goals contributed immensely to human progress in areas such as gender equality, extreme poverty reduction and improved access to basic social services, there is room for more to be done. The 2030 Agenda covers a wide range of areas that are pertinent to my country’s sustainable development and a good complement to our national sustainable development aspirations.
We welcome the establishment of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, on the conservation and sustainable management of oceans and seas. For too long we have observed the decline of the health of the oceans and seas as evidenced in dying coral, a profusion of marine pollution, damaged coastal ecosystems, declining fish stocks and ocean acidification. We recognize the need for a framework within which the implementation of SDG 14 can be progressively assessed, benchmarked and driven forward for the duration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We therefore support mandating the proposed triennial United Nations conference on the oceans and seas as the driver of progress evaluation for SDG 14.
I am delighted to see that a focus on gender remains an integral part of the 2030 Agenda. Achieving gender equality in my country, given our tradition and cultural makeup, continues to be a challenge. However, the political will to continue to advance women’s interests remains steadfast. We have made notable progress
30/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
on women’s access to basic education and health services and their assumption of leadership positions in municipal councils, and today women have better access to basic financial services than ever before. As one of my country’s leaders, I want to see more tangible progress made in the advancement of women and girls and their active participation in national leadership. That can be expedited if more financial resources can be made available for helping my Government to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment.
The success of the 2030 Agenda will depend on access to affordable financial resources and appropriate technology and on substantially improving national capacity. Regarding access to financial resources, the recently adopted Addis Ababa Action Agenda reflects most of the pertinent issues, and it is important for us to implement it swiftly. I join other global leaders in calling on all developed countries to meet their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, as agreed on in the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration. The ODA target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income (GNI), as well as the increased target of 0.2 per cent of GNI to least developed countries (LDCs) by 2020, must be met, for they are crucial to realizing the 2030 Agenda.
Development financing initiatives through South- South cooperation are complementary to this and will remain critical. On that note, 1 would like to take this opportunity to thank the President of China, His Excellency Mr. Xi Jinping, for his recent announcement at the SDG Summit (see A/70/PV.7) that China will provide $2 billion to developing countries. That type of gesture and goodwill demonstrates real action and genuine partnership.
Access to technology is critical to the achievement of sustainable development. I welcome the United Nations initiative, launched in Istanbul, aimed at establishing a technology bank for least developed countries. My Government would greatly appreciate its speedy realization. In the area of technology, and particularly the development of information and communication technologies (ICT), Vanuatu has made tremendous strides in recent years. Our efforts were recognized last weekend when Vanuatu, along with a small number of other countries, received a United Nations award for ICT development, thus demonstrating the transformative role that ICT is playing in improving our people’s lives. It will continue to be a key tool for us in our implementation and achievement of the SDGs.
Regarding improving country capacity, I urge the United Nations to assist developing countries, particularly SIDS and LDCs, in developing their statistical capacities. For small island developing States, that remains a challenge and, as we know, it is the most important basis for formulating evidence-based policy, as well as assessing progress on the 2030 Agenda.
For small island developing States such as Vanuatu, climate change remains a major threat to our achievement of sustainable development. I am therefore grateful to see that Goal 13 of the 2030 Agenda highlights the importance of climate change. However, we should note that this Goal can be meaningful only if we reach a favourable agreement in Paris in December. The connection between climate change and sustainable development is clear. If we do not address climate change, SIDS cannot achieve sustainable development. In March, Vanuatu experienced a category-5 tropical cyclone that affected 60 per cent of the population and 64 per cent of its economy. According to our current assessment, it will take many years and more than $500 million to rebuild our economy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the international community for its swift response in assisting us immediately after the cyclone hit with disaster relief and operations. We look forward to its continued support for our recovery and reconstruction efforts, which we have just embarked on.
Our Pacific island leaders have continued to voice their concerns about climate change in regional and international forums. We are calling for a legally binding agreement limiting the increase in the average global temperature to well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and for anchoring loss and damage provisions in the agreement. We are also calling for a financial package that will commit countries in the UNFCCC’s annex I category to providing $1 billion a year by 2020 in order to finance our adaptation and mitigation needs. These declarations represent our collective voice in the lead-up to the Paris Climate Change Conference and our call to ensure that the planet is saved for us and future generations.
Apart from focusing on climate change, we have also agreed to strengthen regional connectivity, improve productivity and boost economic growth to ensure peace and security in our region, all initiatives that are consistent with the 2030 Agenda. The relationship between the United Nations and the Pacific-based regional organizations is critical to the implementation
15-29568 31/33

A/70/PV.20 30/09/2015
of the 2030 Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway. We welcome the recent adoption of resolution 69/318, on the relationship between the secretariat of the Pacific Islands Forum and the United Nations, and we hope that cooperation can now be translated into concrete action.
My delegation would like to remind the United Nations not to lose sight of decolonization issues, in the light of the emerging challenges that have been presented to us to address collectively. Vanuatu calls on the United Nations family to remain equally focused on finding ways to address this long-overdue issue. The United Nations membership must bring closure to its work on decolonization. The right to self-determination has been a fight endured by many generations. While many have lost their lives in the process, the dream continues for the United Nations and all nations advocating and promoting the democratic principles that still linger in the hearts of many, in the hope that one day their cries will be heard and the promise of a self-determined future delivered. The United Nations must continue the work of the Special Committee on Decolonization in order to maintain a meaningful dialogue on the question of New Caledonia. We thank the Government of France for its cooperation in moving the decolonization process forward. It is therefore important that all parties maintain a dialogue and ensure that all the issues are addressed.
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome President Barack Obama’s recent decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba and reopen diplomatic missions between the two nations. We hope the process will be completed soon with the lifting of the embargo on Cuba.
Like other small Pacific island countries, Vanuatu is a small, open and vulnerable economy. Its openness and small size mean that it is highly vulnerable to external shocks and that opportunities to exploit economies of scale are limited. Despite those challenges, we have been able to record economic growth for the past 10 years. The recent impact of Tropical Cyclone Pam, however, has erased the gains made over that decade. It will take many years to recover, making our efforts to achieve sustainable development somewhat daunting. As a result of this difficulty, my Government recently made a decision to request the United Nations to consider postponing our graduation from LDC status for some years. That will give us ample time to recover fully from the effects of the cyclone and rebuild our economy. I urge the membership of the United Nations
to support our draft resolution on the matter during the Assembly’s seventieth session.
My Government and people will work to mobilize domestic resources and ensure that our institutional capacity is geared to meeting the new development Agenda. Like many other developing countries, we acknowledge that we cannot achieve our sustainable development plans alone, and we therefore call on the international community to help us achieve those goals.
My Government believes that the ongoing tensions between the issues of the freedom of the seas and territorial claims has placed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other relevant international conventions under huge pressure. However, I also believe that States must be willing to cooperate and seek peaceful solutions to any disputes that may have arisen. Umaenupne and Leka islands, commonly known as Matthew and Hunter islands, south of Vanuatu, have been a repository of our cultural heritage since well before the colonial era. As in the other 83 islands, people would use the freedom of the seas to visit their claimed cultural sites. For several decades now, my people have been denied their right to enjoy the freedom of the seas and their claimed territory. I would like to thank and commend the United Nations and the Republic of France for their willingness to hold a dialogue and allow my people their right to visit their claimed territory to perform cultural rituals. The Government of France is to be commended for its important role in advocating for the rights of indigenous peoples in our region and around the world.
I would like to place it on record that Vanuatu has declared the two islands and the water surrounding them a cultural and marine protected area. Cultural visits to the island will be undertaken to revive and empower our indigenous and cultural system. I also wish to put it on record that the Government of Vanuatu will strengthen its ties with its French counterpart in collaborative efforts to ensure that our ocean is safe from terrorism, piracy, climate change and illegal fishing.
In conclusion, the global challenges before us are overwhelming. The global economic uncertainty, the impact of climate change and the unprecedented humanitarian crisis at hand remind us that we need to think differently and adopt innovative approaches to resolve those challenges. We need to deviate from business as usual. That is important especially when implementing the ambitious 2030 Agenda for
32/33 15-29568

30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20
Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the soon to be adopted Paris climate change agreement. What we need are revitalized partnerships, international cooperation and collective wisdom to address those challenges. When we stand together, there is no limit to what we can do together.
"
5511,70,2015,NZL,"The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a good opportunity to reflect on the state of the Organization. For most of us, the United Nations has been one of the key international realities of our lives. It has been at the heart of what has shaped us in the significant developments of the post-Second World War era. But as we all know, it is not perfect. A lot can be said about the shortcomings of the United Nations. They are many and some are serious. But there are things this Organization can do that no other international body can. And it remains the key reference point for States when there is a problem. That is why New Zealand fought so hard for its current seat on the Security Council. We sought election because the Council is the primary body for the maintenance of international peace and security.
New Zealand is a small country at the bottom of the world. Despite being far from many of the world’s trouble spots, we are not immune to their consequences. This time last year, I pressed the case for New Zealand’s election to the Security Council. I would like to thank Member States for their faith in us. In the past nine months we have striven to repay them. Much of the debate in this Hall this week has been about where the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, has not performed. The conflicts and human suffering in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and a long list of other countries show how far we are from achieving the aspirations of our founders and of today’s Members. So, too, does the lack of progress in bringing peace to the Middle East.
Since we have been on the Council, we have found it as hard as many of those here warned. The Council’s agenda is lengthy and contentious. The dynamics within it are difficult. When Council members work together, as they did over the recent agreement on Iran’s nuclear capability, they can still deliver on the Council’s role as it is set out in the Charter of the United Nations. The Iran deal was a notable bright spot this year. Although it was negotiated in Vienna, only the Council had the power to implement it. New Zealand is proud that this occurred during our presidency of the Council in July. Now, the deal has to be implemented and its example followed. That is because this important agreement must become the basis for something wider — a fundamental resetting of relationships and a foundation for the resolution of other regional conflicts.
Nowhere is the resetting of relationships needed more than in Syria. Syria has been torn apart by internal divisions and a leader prepared to wage war on his own people to cling to power. External actors, from within the region and beyond, have tried to tilt the balance in pursuit of their own interests. And as the country descended into lawlessness, the evil nightmare that is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which first took hold in Syria, spread death and terror in the region and beyond. ISIL’s warped ideology and unprecedented use of social media to export its twisted message is a threat to all of us, even a country as distant as New Zealand.
That is why New Zealand has joined the international coalition against ISIL. We are doing what we can to help the victims of the Syrian conflict and combat the scourge of ISIL. New Zealand’s armed forces are helping the Government of Iraq to train its soldiers to
16/25 15-29664

01/10/2015 A/70/PV.23
defend its people. In response to the humanitarian crisis we are helping to fund programmes in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to assist their efforts to support thousands of displaced refugees. Like many other countries, we are implementing an emergency Syrian refugee resettlement programme.
None of that gets to the root of the problems in Syria. All Council members carry responsibility for ending the misery in Syria and beyond. The consequences of inaction are not theoretical. The human toll is real — a 3-year-old boy dead, washed up on a Turkish beach; hundreds of thousands killed and millions forced to flee their homes. We cannot ignore the huddled travellers in the railway stations of Europe or the reality of refugees scratching out a meagre existence in camps and makeshift homes in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. More than 160 leaders have shown up in New York this week to mark the enduring importance of the United Nations over the past 70 years. Yet we do so against the backdrop of the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.
Every one of us sees the harrowing images daily. At the same time we see the consequences of the Security Council’s failure to act over the past four years. It is time for the Council to step up. It is time for it to stop talking about what is right and do what is right. It is time for the Council to do the job for which it was created. It is time for its members to set aside their vested interests and historical alliances in order to stop the violence and end the suffering. It is time for the Council to do its duty by those who have lost their lives and loved ones and the millions who have been displaced. We cannot afford to let the Council go from an institution with failures to a failed institution.
There must be a political solution to the conflict in Syria. And it must come soon. It should address all issues and involve all relevant actors, from within the region and beyond. The question is not Al-Assad or ISIL. Both need to be dealt with. A workable political solution will not be a perfect one. Indeed, it is a classic case of the perfect being the enemy of the good. It will require international cooperation and compromise, on all sides.
The Council also needs to engage in making progress on the Middle East peace process. Since being elected to the Council, New Zealand has made clear its view that the status quo is unsustainable. It puts at risk the achievement of the two-State solution that we all know is the best hope for a lasting peace. That is a
matter of urgency and another critical issue on which the Security Council should lead. We are told that the conditions are not right on the ground and that the parties are not ready, but we should not let conditions on the ground dictate our actions, if our actions can help bring a solution.
We stood for the Council because we believe small States have a positive contribution to make, and we wanted to provide a voice for those who go unheard too often. It was for that latter reason that we arranged the first open debate on the peace and security challenges of small island developing States during our presidency in July (see S/PV.7499). We were heartened by the level of participation of both those States and the broader membership.
The challenge for a small elected member to have its voice heard and its views taken into account is considerable. Part of the problem is structural. That the five permanent members of the Council have the right of veto creates an extraordinary power imbalance. That imbalance is exacerbated by their practices of prenegotiating outcomes before engaging with the 10 elected members and of taking no action when one of the five does not agree. That experience has reaffirmed to us that New Zealand was right to oppose the right of veto when the Charter of the United Nations was being drafted.
It is still our view that the right of veto is a constraint on the effectiveness of the Council and realizing the aspirations of the States Members of the United Nations. For that reason, New Zealand supports the two proposals being put forward this year — by the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group of countries and by France and Mexico — to limit the use of the veto in mass atrocity situations. The fact that two permanent members are supportive represents progress, but part of the problem is also behavioural. The permanent members have become used to exercising power and are protective of their privileged position. They presume to control the Council’s agenda and to determine its processes. Despite that, we are doing what we can to ensure that the elected members have the information and the opportunity to contribute effectively to Council decision-making. And, in turn, that it makes effective decisions.
We want to contribute to a Council that is genuinely focused on finding practical solutions to political problems and not on preserving the status quo. We are well aware that the conflicts on the Council’s agenda
15-29664 17/25

A/70/PV.23 01/10/2015
are complex and not easily solved, but we are realistic in our expectations of what can be achieved. New Zealand believes that the body responsible for maintaining international peace and security has a responsibility to find solutions to the world’s most pressing crises.
Only the United Nations and its agencies have the capacity to focus world attention across a range of issues. That was demonstrated last week with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. We sincerely hope that the Conference of the Parties will be similarly successful in Paris in December, with the adoption of a meaningful agreement on climate change.
Healthy and productive oceans are a key requirement for a sustainable future. I was pleased to announce earlier this week the creation of a marine sanctuary around New Zealand’s Kermadec Islands. The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary will comprise 620,000 square kilometres of ocean in one of the most pristine and special environments on Earth. The Sanctuary will be one of the world’s largest and most significant fully protected marine areas. It will cover an area twice the size of our land mass and better protect the habitats of a huge array of sea creatures.
New Zealand is committed to managing our oceans responsibly, and we are working with our Pacific neighbours to do the same. We have committed $1 billion in development assistance to the Pacific, focused on, among other things, helping support sustainable fisheries management. Our aid is focused on our region and in areas where we know we can get real results for real people, improving livelihoods and creating opportunities. Many Governments around the world are doing the same, and we are proud to play our part.
As I prepare to leave New York, I do so proud of the contribution that New Zealand has made to the sustainable development of our oceans. I leave proud of the contribution New Zealand is making on the Security Council and proud of the values and principles that underpin the country I lead. I also leave dispirited by the Security Council’s failure to help not only the people of Syria, but those in so many other countries. The collective effort of the Security Council, supported by the broader membership, could make a real difference.
I think all of us who have been here over the past week know that collective action must start somewhere. It should start at the United Nations.
"
5551,48,1993,AUS,"I warmly congratulate
Ambassador Insanally, on his election as President of the
forty-eighth session of the General Assembly. As a fellow
Commonwealth member with Guyana, Australia is very
pleased to serve in the Assembly under his presidency.
This session of the General Assembly will deal with a
particularly heavy and important agenda. It will do so at a
time when hopes for, and expectations of, the United
Nations have never been greater - but when, at the same
time, many doubts have been raised about the capacity of the
United Nations system to cope. We will be relying very
much, Mr. President, on your wisdom and your experience
as you preside over our deliberations.

The world is a rather less happy place than we all
hoped it would be after the end of the cold war. Economic
and social deprivation continues to be a harsh daily reality
for many of our countries and our peoples. Not even the
most advanced countries are immune. The developed
Western economies are limping, with low growth rates,
historically high unemployment rates, increasing disparities
as a result between rich and poor, and a continuing inability
so far to reach agreement - either between themselves or
with the rest of the world’s trading nations - about the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalization
measures so necessary to give a new kick-start to world
trade and economic growth.
In the non-Western world, rates of growth have been
extraordinarily uneven. The spectacular advance in some
regions, in particular East Asia, has been in stark contrast to
the continuing terrible deprivation and poverty in others.
Some States have simply been unable to cope with exploding
internal economic, political and social problems, and for all
practical purposes have collapsed, leaving the international
community to respond, somehow, to the humanitarian crises
that have followed so often.
In security terms, the end of the cold war has seen the
end of the super-Power nuclear-arms race and has relieved
us of the immediate threat of nuclear devastation. We have
seen major achievements in nuclear-arms reduction; and for
the first time in the history of the nuclear age a
comprehensive test-ban treaty, which would ban all nuclear
tests in all environments for all time, seems within our
reach. We could help to make it even more so by adopting
by consensus a resolution in this Assembly supporting the
negotiation of that treaty. A very great deal, of course,
depends on the current moratorium on all nuclear testing
being maintained. We in Australia very strongly support
what President Clinton said in that respect this morning.
This year we signed at last, after 20 years of
negotiation, the chemical weapons Convention. But much
remains to be done to bring this and other instruments into
effective operation. And there are still too many countries
unwilling to submit themselves to the disciplines, more
important and more necessary now than ever, of the nuclear
non-proliferation Treaty.
The threat of conflicts between States has certainly not
diminished with the end of the cold war. If anything, the
removal of the cold-war gridlock - the discipline imposed by
the super-Powers on each other and their respective
supporters - has created more room than ever for States to
manoeuvre. Some are beginning to do so, and some are
bound to seek to do so in the future. Some of the emerging
economic Powers have yet to acquire political or military
profiles commensurate with their new wealth, and the
process of adjustment certainly has ample potential to
generate regional tensions. Should those tensions escalate
into conflict, the unhappy reality is that proliferation of more
sophisticated conventional weapons and proliferation of the
capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction make any
prospect of major regional conflict an alarming one for the
world as a whole.
The release of cold-war pressures has been associated
with another major new development of security concern
with which we are all now disturbingly familiar: the
resurgence of ethno-nationalism, often taking a violent form.
Some ethnic groups are being prepared to pursue their
claims for self-determination within the framework of
existing States, arguing essentially for minority human rights
protection - claims of right which, on first principles, we
should all be prepared to acknowledge and support. But
many other such groups have made clear that they will be
satisfied by nothing less than their nations becoming States,
causing the fragmentation of existing States in the process,
and creating some very real dilemmas for the international
community as a result. Again, the proliferating availability
of weaponry of every degree of sophistication has given a
sharp new edge to these concerns.
Looking out upon a world with all these characteristics,
it is easy to be pessimistic and fatalistic. But I do not think
we should retreat into that habit of mind. For everything
that has gone wrong over the last few years, there is
something else that has gone right. To match against the
awful continuing tragedy in the former Yugoslavia, we have,
for example, this month’s peace agreement in the Middle
East - of course, only the first step in what remains a long
journey, but an enormously encouraging one
notwithstanding. And to match against the continuing chaos
and uncertainty in Somalia, and the at best very limited
success of the United Nations operation there, we have now
the unquestioned success of the United Nations operation in
Cambodia - and the end at last to more than 20 years of
what has been a real twentieth-century tragedy involving
bloody war, civil war, genocide, invasion and civil war
again.
A terrible conflict continues in Angola, but peace is at
hand at last in Mozambique; and in South Africa the final
death of apartheid is imminent, as testified last week in this
place by Nelson Mandela. Military regimes have given way
to democratic ones throughout Latin America. Many
problems remain to be solved in the former Soviet Union,
but Governments that can credibly claim to reflect the will
of their peoples are in place throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. The military regime in Myanmar, or Burma,
continues to resist the obvious mood of its people for liberty
and democracy, but elsewhere in the region traditionally
monolithic government structures - driven in many cases by
economic imperatives - are beginning to show signs of
flexibility and responsiveness.
But while I do not believe that we should be unduly
pessimistic or fatalistic about the condition of the world
around us, nor can we afford to be complacent. There is
much more that we can and should be doing to reinforce and
strengthen the international community’s capacity to govern
itself better, and in particular to better guarantee the
maintenance of peace and security in the post-cold-war
world. It is on this subject - the role of the United Nations
and the international community generally in securing peace
in the world of the 1990s and beyond that I want specifically
to focus my remarks today.
A little over a year ago, following a unique meeting of
the Security Council, Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali
published 'An Agenda for Peace'. It was and remains a
remarkable document, one which poses most of the questions
we need to address if we are to have a fair chance of
maintaining international peace and security in the world of
today and the foreseeable future. Since that time, a
worldwide debate has taken place on the issues described in
'An Agenda for Peace', which has involved not only
Governments and officials, but has reached out to embrace
Forty-eighth session - 27 September l993 25
universities, foundations, non-governmental organizations
and many organs of the public media as well. This debate
generated resolutions at the last session of the General
Assembly, several worthwhile changes to some procedures
and structures within the Secretariat, and the prospect of
further changes to come.
It cannot be said, however, that the issues raised by
'An Agenda for Peace' are now all settled, either in theory
or in practice. We still do not have even a completely clear
and consistent shared vocabulary to define the ways in which
it is possible for the United Nations and other organs of the
international community to respond to security problems:
'peacemaking', for example, means different things still to
different people; so do 'preventive diplomacy' and 'peace
building'; the conceptual boundary between 'peace-keeping'
on the one hand and 'peace enforcement' on the other is not
drawn in the same way by everyone who uses these terms.
Nor do we seem yet to have clear and universal
agreement even as to the kind of problems which justify a
security response by the international community. Should
we recognize, for example, a humanitarian right of
intervention and, if so, in what circumstances and to what
extent? When does an economic or social problem become
the kind of security problem which justifies the mobilization
of the response strategies spelt out in Chapters VI and VII
of the United Nations Charter?
Even when it comes to applying a very familiar
response to a new problem - for example, establishing a
peace-keeping operation like the 30 which have now been
initiated since 1946 - there does not yet seem to have been
developed a commonly accepted check list of criteria to
guide decision-makers in determining when precisely the
operation should be set in train, how it should be structured,
managed and resourced, or how long it should continue.
Every situation, of course, has its own characteristics, but is
it really necessary for decisions on these matters by the
Security Council or others to be made on so evidently ad
hoc a basis?
When it comes to thinking about how the United
Nations - and others in the international community,
including regional organizations - might best be structured,
organized, managed and funded to most effectively address
the international peace and security agenda, it is not clear to
me that we have yet heard the last word in that debate.
An extraordinary amount has been achieved in the
tumultuous period since 1989 in responding to the new
demands and challenges that have been unceasingly hurled
at the United Nations, but a good deal more remains to be
done if the United Nations in particular, the only fully
empowered body with global membership that we have, is
to be as effective as we would all want it to be.
It is much easier, of course, to ask all these questions
than to answer them. Identifying problems is always easier
than defining acceptable solutions. But I believe that we all
have a responsibility to each other and the international
community to try to answer these questions and to keep on
working away at the answers until we find common ground.
So it is in that spirit that I put before the Assembly today a
detailed study of these questions, which tries to answer them
in a way which might help us find a little more of that
common ground.
The study, in the form of a book entitled Cooperating
for Peace, has been distributed, I hope, to delegations as I
speak. I do not pretend for a moment that this says the last
word on any of the enormously complex and sensitive issues
with which it deals. It is simply an Australian contribution
to the debate which was so thoughtfully and constructively
initiated by the Secretary-General last year.
The study seeks to do three things in particular. First,
it suggests ways of bringing a little more clarity - to the
extent this is presently lacking - into the concepts and
vocabulary that we use in defining security problems,
defining possible responses and matching responses to
problems. Secondly, it suggests specific criteria that might
be applied by decision-makers in deciding what, if any,
response is appropriate to a particular new security problem.
And, thirdly, it suggests a priority list of areas in which
further United Nations reform might usefully be pursued. In
the short time that remains to me I shall try to give a quick,
outline sketch of what we are trying to say in each of these
respects.
First of all, on the issue of concepts and terminology,
it is perhaps worth making the point at the outset that this is
not just something for academics to wrangle about. It
matters in practice. If decision-makers do not share the
same basic way of looking at issues and the same basic
vocabulary in defining them, there is a very real risk that
they will talk past each other - or, at the very least, find it
very much harder to produce responses which are timely,
properly graduated, effective in practice, affordable and
broadly consistent from one case to the next.
Just as importantly, the choice of words can sometimes
significantly influence the way in which we think about
matters of substance. To give just one example: If we use,
as many people still do, the expression 'peace-making' to
describe military enforcement action, then, simply because
this is such an innocuous and constructive sounding
expression, there is a danger that we may over time become
a little more relaxed than we should be about taking such
action. It is much better, I suggest, to confine the expression
'peace-making' to diplomatic-type activity to resolve conflict
and to reserve the expression 'peace enforcement' to
describe the always dangerous, always messy, and what
should always be the last-resort, activity of applying military
force.
In the study we define security problems, in more or
less escalating order of seriousness, as 'emerging threats',
'disputes', 'armed conflicts' and 'other major security
crises.' We make the point that security is not strictly or
solely a military concept and that threats to security, as
many speakers in the general debate have already said, can
these days come very much from factors such as exploding
population pressures, environmental degradation, mass
involuntary movements of people and the illicit narcotics
trade, among other things.
Equally, we define possible responses to security
problems, again in escalating order of severity, in terms of
'peace- building,' 'preventive diplomacy,' 'preventive
deployment,' 'peace- making,' 'peace-keeping,' 'sanctions'
and 'peace enforcement.' We are at pains to emphasize that
it is only as a last resort that security solutions should be
seen as coming out of the barrel of a gun. We give much
more emphasis than has been common elsewhere to the
concept of 'peace-building,' which we define in the study as
extending not just to post-conflict economic development
and institution-building strategies, but to a whole variety of
preventive strategies, both within particular countries and in
the form of international treaty-type régimes addressing both
military and non-military threats to security.
In defining criteria for embarking on peace operations -
whether peace-keeping or peace enforcement - the most
crucial consideration is that there be a clearminded focus on
the objectives of the exercise and the likely effectiveness of
the operation in achieving those objectives. No operations
of this kind should ever be embarked upon for the sake of
being seen to be doing something. Although it is not always
possible to analyse or predict with certainty, it should always
be possible to avoid embarking on operations which are
manifestly likely to be ineffective and which, as such, put at
risk the most crucial United Nations resource of all, its
credibility.
In the case of peace-keeping we suggest in Cooperating
for Peace that there are seven basic conditions for ensuring
an effective operation: clear and achievable goals; adequate
resources; close coordination of peace-keeping with any
ongoing peacemaking activity; a capacity to be and to be
seen to be absolutely impartial as between the parties who
have been in conflict; a significant degree of local support
for the peace-keepers; evident support for the operation from
external Powers that may have been involved previously in
supporting one side or the other; and a 'signposted exit',
that is, a clearly designated termination point, or set of
termination criteria.
When it comes to peace-enforcement operations, our
suggested criteria for determining involvement are quite
complex and vary according to whether one is talking about
an operation in response to cross-border aggression, as with
Iraq and Kuwait; about one in support of peace-keeping
operations, the basic rationale for United Nations
involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina; or about peace
enforcement in support of humanitarian objectives, as in
Somalia. Without going into all the necessary detail now, I
think the basic considerations always come down to the
following: widespread international support; clear and
achievable goals; adequate total resources to meet those
goals; and clearly defined termination or review points.
If the United Nations is to play with maximum
effectiveness the central role it needs to play in maintaining
international peace and security, then further change, further
reform in the United Nations system, really is necessary.
Some of that change is bound to be painful for some people,
but that is the way of change. Putting it simply and starkly:
Unless the United Nations develops a comprehensive
capacity to address today’s and tomorrow’s problems - not
yesterday’s - there is a very real risk of the United Nations
gradually losing, with Governments and peoples around the
world, the credibility it needs to survive.
In the study we identify a number of priority areas for
change. The first is to restructure the Secretariat to ensure
that the Secretary-General has an effective chain of
command exercising authority over major United Nations
operations and to consolidate and coordinate in a more
orderly and manageable way the present sprawl of
departments and agencies. We support the proposal that the
Secretary-General create a new senior structure at United
Nations Headquarters under which he would have four
Deputy Secretaries-General responsible, respectively, for
peace and security, economic and social operations,
humanitarian operations and administration and management.
Each such Deputy Secretary-General would have full
executive responsibility for the operational issues falling
within his or her portfolio, subject only to direction by the
Secretary-General. This would be a big change, and it is not
the first time it has been proposed, but it is the one that,
more than anything else, would create the conditions for
more orderly and effective management throughout the
United Nations system.
The second priority need is to resolve once and for all
the United Nations critical funding problem. Various
adventurous ideas have been canvassed for external
funding - money coming from sources other than Member
States - and we suggest that at least one of those ideas,
namely, a small levy on international airline travel, be
further explored. But overwhelmingly, of course, the
problem is one that has been created by Member States,
including the richest of our number, and it is entirely within
our ability to resolve by meeting our assessed contributions
for regular budgets and peace operations in full and on time.
It is an abuse of good management principles and of basic
common sense to be forcing the Secretary-General to spend
so much of his time pleading for debts to be honoured. In
that respect I echo the sentiments expressed a few minutes
ago by Mrs. Brundtland.
If the bulk of current arrears were to be paid by the end
of this year, the United Nations finances would be in a quite
healthy position, with the Working Capital Fund, the Peace-
keeping Reserve Fund and the Special Account all
replenished and the Organization in a position to meet all
outstanding troop-contribution costs.
The third priority is to improve the management of
peace operations, both at Headquarters and in the field.
Some very significant and useful steps have already been
taken in this regard in the context of the creation of the new
Department of Peace-keeping Operations, but more remains
to be done, including in particular the development over time
of a properly constituted General Staff to plan and manage
the military dimensions of such operations.
The fourth priority is to give special attention to the
machinery of preventive diplomacy, again both at
Headquarters and in the field. These efforts have been
largely ad hoc in the past, although the Department of
Political Affairs is gradually building a core of appropriate
expertise. Quite apart from anything else, there is an
overwhelming cost advantage in doing more to stop disputes
becoming armed conflicts. We estimate the cost of keeping
100 well-qualified, experienced practitioners of preventive
diplomacy in the field for a year to be $21 million; compare
that with this year’s peace operations budget of $3.7 billion -
and compare it, moreover, with the $70 billion that it is
estimated to have cost the United Nations coalition to fight
the six-week Gulf war.
The fifth priority is to rethink the whole system of
humanitarian relief coordination. Despite advances that have
been made with the creation of the Department of
Humanitarian Affairs, we think some basic structural
problems remain. We propose that they be addressed in a
radical way by the creation of a new disaster-response
agency, combining the relief and basic rehabilitation
functions of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme
(WFP), which would work in turn directly to the suggested
Deputy Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs.
The sixth priority, as we see it, is to take various steps
to raise the profile within the United Nations system of
peace-building. This is, after all, the point of intersection
between the Organization’s peace and security role and its
economic and social role, and it should be given recognition
and emphasis as such. The pursuit of peace and security has
to include the satisfaction of basic human needs, as well as
the direct prevention, containment and settlement of armed
conflict. Much of the United Nations system is in fact
already concerned with peace- building in the form of
activities such as international law-making, disarmament,
economic and social advancement, sustainable development,
democratization and institution building. But much more
can be done, organizationally, to link these activities
together, to recognize their security significance, and to
ensure that they are pursued with a sense of common
purpose.
The remaining priority, a very large subject in itself, as
we all know, is to regenerate the Security Council - not
because it is now working ineffectively, but because its
manifest lack of representativeness is beginning to impact
upon its legitimacy. The Security Council is the linchpin of
the whole United Nations peace and security system, and it
is in no one’s interest that its credibility should be allowed
to gradually erode. The outstanding questions about the size
and shape of the Council should certainly be resolved by the
time of the United Nations fiftieth anniversary in 1995.
This, indeed, remains an ideal target date for the
achievement of a whole range of necessary organizational
reforms.
Running right through the study - and underlying all the
suggestions we have been making about structure and
process - is a single sustaining idea, that of cooperative
security. This embraces two perhaps rather more familiar
ideas, common security and collective security. But the
overall flavour of cooperative security can perhaps best be
captured by describing it, in a little more detail, as an
approach that emphasizes reassurance rather than deterrence;
that is inclusive rather than exclusive; that favours
multilateralism over unilateralism or bilateralism; that does
not rank military solutions over non-military ones; that
assumes that States are the principal actors in the security
system, but also accepts that non-State actors have an
important role to play; that does not particularly emphasize
the creation of formal security institutions but does not reject
them either; and that above all stresses the value of creating
habits of dialogue.
A good deal of the spirit of cooperative security is in
fact to be found in the Charter of the United Nations.
Paragraph 4 of Article 1, a provision much neglected in the
past, designates the United Nations as a 'centre for
harmonizing the actions of nations' - not the sentiments of
nations, but the actions of nations. In Articles 55 and 56
Member States pledge themselves to create the
'conditions of stability and well-being which are
necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among
nations'.
Underscored in that context are the promotion of higher
standards of living, the solution of economic and social
problems and respect for human rights.
Too often during the cold war we looked past these
obligations and concerns, because we were preoccupied with
military means of survival. But the threats that concerned us
then no longer exist; and what was written in San Francisco,
before the cold war froze our capacity to deal with many
other kinds of threats to security, should now be seen as a
compelling guide.
Our survival in the 1990s and beyond will depend on
our developing a new understanding of what constitutes
security and what contributes to it. It will depend on our
capacity to think clearly about how to react to new security
problems as they arise. It will depend on our willingness to
rethink and to reshape our institutions, including the United
Nations, so that they can cope with new realities. But,
above all, it will depend on our all developing and sustaining
a real commitment to cooperating for peace.
"
5640,48,1993,PNG,"On behalf of the
people and Government of Papua New Guinea, I should like
to congratulate Ambassador Insanally of Guyana on his
election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-
eighth session. In so doing, I should like to recall - and to
express my delegation’s sincere appreciation for - the even-
handed and efficient manner in which his predecessor, Mr.
Stoyan Ganev, the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria, presided
over the Assembly at its forty-seventh session.
His outstanding example has maintained and thereby
helped to strengthen a high standard which we are confident
Mr. Insanally will match. His election brings us particular
pleasure because of the many important interests which
Guyana shares with Papua New Guinea and the increasingly
strong relations which have been developing between our
two countries, mainly through cooperation in the context of
multilateral organizations such as the Commonwealth, the
African, Caribbean and Pacific group of Governments parties
to the Lomé Convention, and the United Nations itself.
The Government of Papua New Guinea is also pleased
to welcome the further progress towards the universal
membership of the United Nations marked by the admission
of the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Eritrea, The
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Monaco and
Andorra. We look forward to cooperating with their
Governments and delegations in advancing the objectives of
the United Nations.
In welcoming the new Members, I feel bound to
observe that my Government is concerned that other small
States, including a number in the South Pacific, which find
it difficult to afford to join and send missions to the United
Nations, should be provided with the means of keeping
abreast of developments and of having proper account taken
of their interests, perhaps through such arrangements as a
regional observer, as a number of Governments have
proposed to the South Pacific Forum.
I turn now to the proposed United Nations initiative on
opportunity and participation. When I addressed the General
Assembly 12 months ago, I said that I had chosen
'opportunity and participation' as the main theme and goal
of my policy as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also forecast
that my Government would be formally proposing an
initiative for the United Nations bearing the same name.
The proposal is now listed as item 151 on the agenda
of the current session of the General Assembly. The
initiative is, of course, important for Papua New Guinea -
opportunity and participation are, in fact, among the national
goals and directive principles embodied in our national
Constitution. It is also important to other developing
countries where increasing opportunity for, and participation
by, citizens is a public issue and an official aim. It is,
moreover, directly relevant to countries where previous
economic arrangements are in transition to markets. In an
increasingly interdependent world, where issues and ideas
often have global implications, it should be of interest and
certainly deserves support worldwide.

Papua New Guinea became independent on the very
same day, 16 September 1975, as the General Assembly
adopted a consensus resolution - 3362 (S-VII), on
'Development and international economic co-operation' -
directed, in the words of its first preambular paragraph, 'to
accelerate the development of developing countries'. The
timing was, almost certainly, coincidental. But it is none the
less worthy of notice because of what it suggests about the
circumstances, including a continuing need to achieve the
same aim on the part of countries such as Papua New
Guinea both then and now.
In the early l990s, Papua New Guinea has been
enjoying an unprecedented rate of economic growth,
measured, in the standard terms employed by bodies such as
the World Bank, at something more than 9 per cent per year.
But few would suggest that the living standards of most of
our people have improved at anything like the same rate.
The measure is quite seriously misleading, as many of us
have known for a very long time. But so are government
policies and processes of economic development that fail to
pay adequate attention to questions of distribution, including
who benefits and who takes part. I refer here, I should add,
to distribution not only of Government services but of
openings - and even more to effective access - for people to
benefit by taking part in economic development.
In certain sectors of society in many countries,
including my own, people - particularly those living in rural
areas - are still trying to enter the cash economy for the first
time. In other sectors and even more countries, people who
have long been engaged in monetary transactions are trying
to increase openings, access and mutually beneficial
interactions. Increasing opportunity and participation is, in
many respects, a universal goal. The urgency of the need to
address the means of achieving it comprehensively,
systematically, thoroughly and critically now arises out of
concern at several features of the current international
situation.
The first is the difficult and often worsening
circumstances of and in many developing countries. A
second is the problems being encountered in the transition to
markets in countries where economic arrangements were
previously State-centred. Another feature results from a
tendency among economic policy-makers in widely scattered
parts of the world, including developed countries and the
major international financial institutions, during the 1980s to
favour reducing the economic role of the State and to leave
questions of access and distribution of benefits to markets.
Complicating the effects of so-called 'aid fatigue' in
developed countries are the increasing need and demand for
aid, investment and commercial loans arising from the
changes occurring in Eastern and Central Europe, the former
Soviet Union, southern Africa and the Middle East. New
opportunities for scarce capital and other resources are also
opening up in the same and other areas. Furthermore,
expensive and urgent needs will have to be met when the
terrible conflicts currently raging in the former Yugoslavia,
the Caucasus, parts of Africa and elsewhere are resolved and
rehabilitation can get under way.
In other words, resumption or continuation of
development in many parts of the world will require that
more must be done with less. Opportunity, access and
beneficial participation in economic development must be
quite dramatically increased if living conditions are to be
maintained, let alone improved.
The proposal which the Papua New Guinea Government
is therefore making is for the United Nations to establish a
small panel of distinguished, expert and experienced persons
broadly representative of the international community to
review what has already been done and to identify options
to increase opportunity and participation, with particular,
though not exclusive, reference to the economies of
developing countries. We propose not an academic study,
but one that draws on actual experience and makes
recommendations for practical action. We do not have any
fixed ideas about what it should say. Rather, we want it to
make a close, critical examination of what has been
attempted, what has been proposed and what has been - for
whatever reason, or for none - overlooked.
We emphatically do not want the project to begin with
doctrinaire assumptions; rather, we want it to ask questions -
for example, about when and how it is best for the State to
limit its involvement in the economy or to withdraw
completely, and when and how the State should act to
maximize opportunity and participation. Above all, we want
it to investigate and to provide advice on the best way of
linking opportunity, via effective access, to participation.
Thus, the panel, the project and the report ought to be
multidisciplinary in approach and scope, examining critically
both experiences and ideas about ways in which legal,
administrative, economic, social and other arrangements help
or hinder increasing economic opportunity and participation.
While the focus should be on the particular difficulties
of developing countries, the project should, we believe, look
further afield. It will, in fact, have to do so if its research
and findings are to stimulate the world-wide information
exchange, and, above all make the practical difference which
we hope will result.
Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 3
In my statement to the General Assembly a year ago I
described the proposed United Nations initiative on
opportunity and participation as being in some respects 'the
economic counterpart' to the Secretary-General’s most
succinct and constructive report, 'An Agenda for Peace.' It
should also be seen, I believe, as a complement to, and a
necessary filling-out of, other important United Nations
resolutions and documents that have been concerned with
development issues more generally, such as the reports of
the Pearson and Brandt Commissions, and 'The Challenge
to the South'.
The panel and the report envisaged in our proposed
draft resolution should, in addition, be viewed as
complementing and helping to fill out the Brundtland Report,
particularly in so far as they manage to identify options not
only for maintaining increased opportunity and participation,
but for continuing to increase them so as to allow living
standards to go on being raised for and by future
generations.
While we await publication of the Secretary-General’s
eagerly anticipated report outlining an agenda for
development, the proposed initiative on opportunity and
participation should not be seen as a rival or a duplication.
The proposal ought to be seen instead for what it is intended
to be, namely, a constructive start and a practical
contribution to setting objectives and specifying means for
development into the twenty-first century.
Like other supporters of the proposal, the Government
of Papua New Guinea has been gratified by the strong and
positive response with which the proposed United Nations
initiative on opportunity and participation has been greeted
by Governments, non-governmental organizations and
international bodies in diverse parts of the world.
We have particularly appreciated the expressions of
support we have received from the Government of the
Assembly’s President, the Chairman of the General
Assembly’s Second Committee, and organizations
particularly concerned with advancing the common interests
of developing countries, the Group of 77 and the Movement
of Non-Aligned Countries.
In our own immediate neighbourhood, we have been
assured of strong, individual and collective support by
members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations
(ASEAN), the Melanesian Spearhead Group, and the South
Pacific Forum, which includes the Governments of
developed countries in the region.
With assistance from the United Nations Development
Programme, my Government has convened both a national
and a regional Workshop, in which highly respected,
variously experienced and diversely skilled persons gave
their time on an honorary basis to help develop and refine
the proposal. The proceedings of both Workshops are being
circulated to all United Nations members.
When the proposal is debated in the Assembly on 15
November, we look to all members of the United Nations for
contributions to its further development and refinement, and,
of course, for their votes. As it did with the resolution
(47/441) on development and international economic
cooperation, adopted on Papua New Guinea’s independence
day, my Government hopes that the General Assembly will
endorse the proposed United Nations initiative on
opportunity and participation by consensus.
Believing as we do in the importance of the proposed
initiative, but conscious of the severe strains currently
imposed on the United Nations human and financial
resources, and bearing in mind the recommendation made to
all members by the Second Ministerial Meeting of the
Standing Committee on Economic Cooperation of the
Non-Aligned Movement, my Government has decided to
make a special pledge to contribute K100,000 - the
equivalent of a little more than $102,000 - to assist in
realizing the proposal. While we believe that
implementation of the proposal must not depend on special
donations, we call upon others to do the same in accordance
with their means.
With regard to conferences on development and related
issues, consistent with Papua New Guinea’s obvious interest
in development issues generally, and in those that pertain to
small island countries in particular, my Government looks
forward to the first Global Conference on Sustainable
Development of Small Island Developing States, which is to
be held in Barbados in April 1994.
We shall remain actively involved in preparations for,
and the proceedings of, what we regard as a most important
occasion for sharing experiences and ideas, including both
problems and hopes, with island States in our own and other
regions.
For closely related reasons, we also look forward to the
International Conference on Population and Development, to
be held in Cairo in 1994.
Having taken a close interest in the deliberations and
outcome of the World Conference on Human Rights in
Vienna in June, we shall contribute as best we can to the
4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
preparations for the World Summit for Social Development,
to be held in Copenhagen, and the Fourth World Conference
on Women, scheduled for Beijing, both in 1995.
I turn to the subject of apartheid and sanctions against
South Africa. Successive Governments of Papua New
Guinea have always been strongly opposed to apartheid, both
in principle and in practice. We have consistently applied
sanctions, backed by the force of Papua New Guinea law,
against those who have upheld it. Even as apartheid has
been dismantled, and progress towards a democratic,
multi-racial South Africa has been observed, my Government
has been conscious of the special perspectives and interests
of African States. We have accordingly taken the view that
we would remove our sanctions against South Africa only in
consultation, conducted through bodies such as the
Commonwealth and the United Nations, with such States.
Despite the economic interests which might have been
served by allowing links between Papua New Guinea and
South Africa, we have willingly paid the price our policy has
required.
I have been personally moved in recent days by the
addresses made by the President of the African National
Congress, Mr. Nelson Mandela, before the United Nations
Special Committee against Apartheid as well as the Joint
Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
Group of countries and the European Community.
Following the recommendations made by Mr. Mandela, the
Organization of African Unity and the Commonwealth
Secretariat, as well as the resolution adopted by consensus
in the General Assembly on Friday 8 October, my
Government will now take steps to remove legally enforced
sanctions. But in doing so we remain conscious of the
continuing - and unfortunate - relevance of Mr. Mandela’s
pointed reminder to the Joint Assembly of the ACP Group
and the European Community that:
'the white minority Government and its institutions ...
should not be ... treated as though they were the
representative of all the people of South Africa.'
The struggle for real equality for the African citizens of
South Africa is certainly not over. In some respects, it has
scarcely begun. My Government believes very strongly that
the achievement of a genuinely stable, democratic and
multi-racial South Africa requires increasing opportunities
for access to and participation in all areas of society,
including the economy, by the country’s African population.
My next subject is the progress towards peace in the
Middle East. Successive Governments of Papua New
Guinea have consistently followed a policy of supporting
the right of Israel to exist within secure borders, while
recognizing the Palestinian people’s right to a homeland.
We are accordingly both impressed and encouraged by the
dramatic, bold and hopeful agreements reached by the Israeli
Government and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
We commend the steps that have since been taken,
including the diplomatic and material support provided by
other Governments to facilitate implementation of those
agreements. As our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable
Paias Wingti, has already announced, the Government of
Papua New Guinea will do what little it can to further the
process, by acknowledging the constructive role being played
by the Palestine Liberation Organization and examining ways
in which we might seek to strengthen relations with the
legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people.
I come now to the reform and revitalization of the
United Nations and the recharging of its resources.
The welcome developments in southern Africa and the
Middle East, particularly those related to Israel, the occupied
territories and the Palestine Liberation Organization, reveal
both strengths and weaknesses in the United Nations, and
suggest that while there are situations in which the United
Nations can play an important, even vital, role, there are also
situations in which it cannot.
We must recognize that when the United Nations itself
cannot, for whatever reason, be effective, then individual
Governments, such as Norway’s, regional organizations, such
as the Organization of African Unity, or some other body
may be able to initiate or facilitate a positive outcome.
The Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the
reforms which are gradually being made to the United
Nations system: in the Secretariat and other organs, and in
the manner in which our deliberations are organized. We
also welcome the generally revitalized role that our
Organization aspires to play in international relations. But
we must remember that internal reform and reorganization
are only as important as their eventual outcome.
A revitalized United Nations must not be allowed to
become an instrument of sectional interests or ill-planned
adventurism. In the context of the contrast between the
evidently satisfactory outcome of United Nations efforts in
Cambodia and the uncertainties of the situation in Somalia,
my Government feels a need to sound a cautionary warning.
The terrible events unfolding in the former Yugoslavia,
particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the mounting
toll of human death, injury and suffering resulting from
conflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union reinforce my
Forty-eighth session - 11 October l993 5
Government’s reservations about aspects of the current
debate over the part that the United Nations can and should
play in the post-cold-war international order.
The Government of Papua New Guinea is also
conscious of the selectivity and costs of United Nations
peace-keeping, peace-observing and peacemaking operations,
and of the need to ensure that the Organization is reformed,
revitalized and re-endowed with sufficient resources to make
a difference to the very basis of peace in developing
countries: development itself.
My next topic is decolonization, indigenous people and
natural resources. In this, the United Nations International
Year of the World’s Indigenous People, my Government had
the rare privilege of hosting a Regional Seminar of the
Special Committee of 24 on decolonization, chaired by
Papua New Guinea’s Permanent Representative at the United
Nations. The occasion gave us an opportunity to reaffirm
our commitment to the decolonization of New Caledonia,
with special safeguards for its indigenous people, the
Kanaks. The Government of Papua New Guinea is strongly
opposed to any suggestion that the Matignon Accords might
not be fully honoured. The same position has been adopted
by our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead Group and the
South Pacific Forum.
In addition to the question of New Caledonia, the
Regional Seminar also focused attention on other relics of
European colonialism, including French Polynesia, where
Polynesian demands for independence seem to be gaining
strength.
Elsewhere in the South Pacific, the negotiated
settlement between the Governments of Nauru and Australia
has been widely welcomed for the redress it provides for a
long period of colonial exploitation of Nauru’s principal
land-based natural resource and the destruction of much of
its natural environment.
The settlement is also arousing considerable interest as
to its possible implications in other former Trust Territories
and colonial dependencies. The Government of Papua New
Guinea is only one of a number of interested parties which
have the matter under close examination. My Government
is also only one among many in welcoming, and wishing to
encourage, efforts to recognize the rights and to improve the
situation of other indigenous people in the South Pacific and
elsewhere.
Together with our partners in the Melanesian Spearhead
Group - the Governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu
- we have signed a Declaration on Cooperation in
Development of Natural Resources. One of the explicit
objectives of the Declaration is to facilitate implementation
of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.
Another objective, which has yet to be realized, is to
supplement existing efforts in relation to regional fisheries
by broadening and deepening cooperation between the
Governments of countries in the South Pacific where other
natural resources are being developed, often by outsiders.
The crisis in Papua New Guinea’s North Solomons
Province is an unfortunate and costly internal affair of Papua
New Guinea. It continues, still unresolved, even as
Government and other services are being restored. I am
therefore pleased to report that my Government has recently
been engaged in productive exchanges with the Government
of the Solomon Islands, particularly concerning the spill-over
effects of the crisis on and near the common border.
Following these exchanges, I have issued an invitation
on the Government’s behalf to the Joint Assembly of the
African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States party to the
Lomé Convention and the European Community to send a
visiting mission to Papua New Guinea, including the North
Solomons Province, to assess the situation and to
recommend how it might assist in rehabilitation.
The Government has also announced its intention to
work towards an All-Bougainville Leaders’ Conference to
try to resolve the crisis by political means. The Government
of Solomon Islands has offered its cooperation in what has
been, at times, a rather difficult situation. We hope to
continue our dialogue over long-term measures to strengthen
bilateral relations.
With respect to regional and global economic
cooperation, the Government of Papua New Guinea, like
most other Members of the United Nations, is concerned at
the possibility that reform of the international trading system
might fail as a result of the apparent intransigence of vested
interests in certain developed countries during the final
stages of the Uruguay Round of negotiations of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We also do not
believe that regional trading blocs can be an adequate
substitute for an equitable and orderly international trading
system.
The Government of Papua New Guinea does not see
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (APEC) as
a replacement or a rival for an updated version of GATT.
But we do regard APEC as being important to our interests.
More than 80 per cent in value of exports from Papua New
Guinea go to the existing APEC member countries. Nearly
90 per cent of our imports come from exactly the same
6 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
countries. Other aspects of Papua New Guinea’s
international economic relations are just as deeply enmeshed
with APEC members. With encouragement from existing
members, my Government has therefore applied to join
APEC. We believe that it would not be right for such a
body to continue without a single member from the centre
of a region whose name it bears: the Pacific. We look
forward to an early - and positive - response to our
application.
In conclusion, I should like to say the following:
No human being can have failed to be deeply moved
by, or to feel the utmost sympathy for, people affected by
the disastrous earthquake which occurred in India in late
September.
No one who has been following the developments
consequent on the changes in the former Soviet Union can
have failed to be both excited and concerned by the dramatic
political and military confrontations which have been
occurring in the Russian Federation. All of us must surely
be concerned at reports that nuclear testing has been
resumed, at the possibility that more tests might follow, and
that weapons of mass destruction might grow in number,
power and circulation.
In short, notwithstanding the progress made towards
finding lasting solutions to some long-standing issues since
the cold war ended, we continue to live in a rapidly
changing, often fragile and uncertain world. Able by virtue
of our membership of the United Nations at least to let our
views be known on what are some of the most important
and pressing issues of our time, the Government of Papua
New Guinea has, therefore, chosen to give close attention to
an issue of particular concern to developing countries, to
explore avenues of cooperation with other States, and to
propose a United Nations initiative on 'Opportunity and
Participation'. Let me end by repeating my previous call for
members’ support for a proposal intended to assist in
identifying what the people and Government of Papua New
Guinea believe to be common interests, global problems and
practical solutions.
"
5674,48,1993,MHL,"On behalf of the
people and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands, I warmly congratulate Ambassador Samuel Insanally
on his election as President of what promises to be a historic
session of the General Assembly. I would also like to
express my country’s profound appreciation to his
predecessor, Mr. Stoyan Ganev, Foreign Minister of
Bulgaria, for his superior guidance during a time of
unprecedented change.
We are gathered here at a crucial juncture in human
history when numerous changes are becoming apparent.
Few of us ever imagined that we would witness in our
lifetimes the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, a handshake
between the leaders of Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the peaceful separation of Eritrea from
Ethiopia after decades of war, or the transition to a
Government in South Africa that is truly representative of its
people. In the current international climate we can be
optimistic about the peaceful resolution of the difficult
problems of our time. However, at the same time our world
witnesses these triumphs of the human spirit, it also faces
grave new problems, such as the tragedies that are unfolding
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia.
The new order will require fundamental changes in the
attitudes and thinking of nations and all mankind. Gone are
the clearly defined divisions of super-Power conflict. In
their place are a myriad of problems, suppressed during the
cold war, that are now resurfacing. The confrontation
between East and West has given way to more intricate
problems, without readily apparent solutions. There are no
easy answers for bringing restraint to the extremes of ethnic
and religious nationalism, or promoting human rights and
sustainable development. Yet the past few months have
shown the real progress that can be made on even the most
intractable problems. Rather than wringing our hands, we
must draw upon the diversity of views represented in this
grand Hall and upon the examples of those who dedicated
their lives to the struggle to bring peace to the world.
The world’s billions are increasingly looking to the
United Nations for solutions. However, as currently
structured and financed, the United Nations by itself cannot
accommodate the breadth and gravity of the many problems
it faces. It is our view that the Organization must be
carefully re-evaluated to ensure its effectiveness in a
situation of new realities. We support the creation of an
Office of Inspector General and will continue to study the
various proposals for expansion of the Security Council
membership.
As proud Members of this body, we cheer our
Organization’s successes and are troubled by its few
setbacks. The Marshallese people mourn the loss of
members of United Nations peace-keeping missions, which
are bravely endeavouring to maintain peace and provide
assistance to those in danger.
Allow me, for a moment, to address the special
situation of the island nations. The physical limitations of
islands and their lack of natural resources, which larger

nations might regard as insurmountable barriers, we, by
necessity, view as challenges to overcome. Throughout
history, islanders have displayed a remarkable degree of
innovation and adaptation, which has allowed us to survive
numerous natural and man-made disasters. Our people and
way of life were not deterred by the horrors of modern
weaponry from which the Marshallese people suffered
during the nuclear testing. Despite the end of the super-
Power arms race, the world must still confront the grave
dangers of nuclear testing, nuclear proliferation, and the
production, transit and disposal of nuclear material. The
Marshall Islands will forever have a special interest in the
dismantling of nuclear weapons because many Marshallese
people are still prevented from returning to their ancestors’
homeland.
As survivors of that legacy, we very much welcomed
the nuclear-testing moratorium. We are greatly distressed
that this moratorium has now been broken by one of the
nuclear Powers, and we would appeal to the others not to
follow this path. I should like to lend my Government’s
voice to the voices of others that have called for negotiations
on a lasting and effective comprehensive nuclear-test-ban
treaty that will enjoy universal adherence. It is the wish of
the people of the Marshall Islands that no one else should
have to endure the same hardships and physical harm that
we did. We pray for a world free from nuclear testing and
intend to participate actively in the steps leading to such a
treaty.
We were proud to be one of the first signatories of the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and
on Their Destruction earlier this year in Paris. We will do
our part to contribute to the goal of the abolition of that
immoral class of weapons and commend the many officials
who worked on the Convention for their tireless efforts.
Perhaps the most effective way to avoid the grave
consequences of nuclear weapons is to address the problem
at its source by prohibiting the production of weapons-grade
plutonium. We therefore look forward to working on a
treaty to this effect, and we commend the United States and
others for taking the lead in this regard.
The islands of the Pacific are especially vulnerable to
the dangers posed by transport of nuclear material. We hope
that such shipments will cease. If they are to continue, the
States responsible must take every precaution to ensure that
the safety of States along the sea lanes and the high seas is
ensured.
All of humanity is shocked by the brutality of
nationalist and ethnic conflicts raging throughout the world
today. The possibility of introducing nuclear weapons in
these disputes threatens global peace and security and raises
the spectre of death and suffering on a magnitude never
before witnessed. My Government will continue to support
all efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.
The efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) in the area of nuclear safeguards merit special
praise. I am very pleased to report that last week the
Marshall Islands was accepted as a member of the IAEA,
and we look forward to contributing to the work of the
Agency. We are confident that the Agency’s vast expertise
in the area of protection from radiation can shed light on the
matter and at the same time come up with remedial
treatment for the many Marshallese victims afflicted by
numerous cancerous diseases resulting from nuclear testing.
My Government warmly applauds the increased
attention by the world community to human rights and
democratic institutions. Although it fell short of some of our
expectations, this year’s World Conference on Human Rights
was an important milestone in the efforts to protect the
rights of individuals and vulnerable sectors of society.
Perhaps more important, the Vienna Declaration and
Programme of Action clearly demonstrated that respect for
basic human rights and fundamental freedoms can exist in a
context of cultural diversity.
As important as the Vienna Declaration is, it is
meaningless without the means to enforce its provisions.
We will therefore continue strongly to support efforts aimed
at creating a post of United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights and a Special Rapporteur for Women’s
Rights, and we will continue to study proposals for an
international court with jurisdiction to consider cases of
human-rights violations.
Tomorrow’s leaders are today’s children. With this in
mind, we must ensure that our children are well prepared to
accept the mantle that will be passed on to them. For
decades, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has
advanced this objective with determination, and we are
especially appreciative of its assistance to the Marshallese
children. We are proud to have recently ratified the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and we encourage
others to do the same so that the world may attain
UNICEF’s goal of universal adherence by the year 2000.
The Marshall Islands are endowed with natural beauty
and a rich cultural heritage. The development potential of
Forty-eighth session - 6 October 1993 3
our islands resides in the preservation of their fragile
environment. Because our land area is so limited, we treat
it with the greatest respect and conserve it as best we can.
Given the small land area of our atolls, we face
constraints to agricultural and industrial development. As
the pressure from a growing population increases in my
country, additional demands are made on our resources.
Regrettably, we have become increasingly dependent on
imports to meet basic human needs.
The long distances from markets of many islands result
in especially high transport costs. In our case, we are almost
2,000 miles from the nearest major market for our goods.
Consequently, transport costs raise the cost of goods to
levels that are often not competitive. Even with competitive
products, restrictive trade barriers further limit our access to
markets. We are hopeful that the negotiations of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will produce a
trade agreement that is equitable and fair to all nations.
The Marshall Islands welcomes with gratitude the
recently approved country programme of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP). It would be especially
welcome if this plan of action could assist my country
significantly along the road to sustainable development. The
spirit of cooperation that was exhibited at the first round-
table meeting in 1991 is evident in this programme. It is
hoped that this will be the first step in a long and fruitful
partnership and that the UNDP will become more responsive
to the special needs of the Marshall Islands. Like many of
the island States in the region, the Marshall Islands is not a
traditional recipient of overseas development aid, and we
have few bilateral partners. Given its regional expertise, we
are pleased that UNDP is becoming a major focal point for
our development assistance. UNDP understands the
complexities of the Pacific region and the development
challenge for the island States. We hope that the UNDP
budget for the region will not be cut back any further. The
Pacific is a vast area, and the logistical challenges faced by
the field office in Suva, Fiji, are daunting.
Sustainable development is a primary objective of
Government planning. We are increasingly aware of the
limits that constrain our development potential. We want to
prosper on the resources that we have, but we do not want
to repeat mistakes that others have made on their road to
development. I commend our neighbour, Papua New
Guinea, for the important work it has initiated to integrate
sustainable development into the framework of international
relations.
The Marshall Islands is a small nation, and we
increasingly feel the strain caused by our expenditures on the
United Nations. We are, of course, very grateful and proud
to be a part of this body, but we are becoming worried at the
scale of new contributions, particularly for peace-keeping
operations. The burden of membership is not shared equally
by every citizen of the world, and we would like to see this
inequity in contributions addressed in some way. If one
looks at the cost of United Nations membership on a per
capita basis, one sees that the island States are among the
very top contributors.
The vulnerability of small islands to natural disasters
and to fluctuations in the world economy make it difficult to
quantify the well-being of our people. Calculations of per -
capita gross domestic product and other traditional economic
indices do not accurately represent the standard of living in
the islands. Perhaps other criteria could be devised to reflect
the complexities of our situation.
The Marshall Islands was one of the first countries to
ratify the Conventions adopted at the Rio Conference on the
environment. Developments subsequent to the Rio summit
have been closely observed by the Marshall Islands
Government. It is our sincere hope that the process initiated
at Rio de Janeiro will succeed, so that our islands can be
saved from possible destruction by global climate change.
The Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of
Small Island Developing States will increase world-wide
understanding of the vulnerability of our islands. The
Government of Barbados is to be thanked for generously
offering to host that Conference next year. We are,
however, a little disturbed by the response by some donor
countries to the Conference. It must be reiterated that the
Conference has its mandate from Rio and from the forty-
seventh session of the General Assembly, and that it should
be considered as a test case for sustainable development. It
will be an attempt to address issues that are specific to small
island States in their quest for sustainable development. The
will of the global community to live up to the promises
made in Rio will face its first test, and the implications of
the outcome of the Conference will be significant to all.
Throughout history the sea has united my people and
has been vital to our lives. It provides our nourishment; it
is a source of income; and our culture and traditions have in
large part been shaped by the ocean. The majority of our
population derives its livelihood from ocean-based activities,
and our territorial waters abound with fish that can feed
people around the world. Clearly, our fate is tied to the
ocean. Today, however, our way of life is threatened by a
rise in the level of the very ocean that has given us life for
4 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
thousands of years. We are greatly appreciative of the
efforts and attention given to the problem by the world
community, most notably in the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, signed at the Rio Earth Summit, which my
Government is proud to have ratified.
However, for a low-lying atoll like the Marshall Islands
the Framework Convention may have come too late. We are
eager that funds from all sectors of the United Nations
system, especially the Global Environment Facility, be made
available for the purpose of adaptation to a rise in the sea
level. We also realize fully that changes required of
residents of industrialized countries will entail considerable
sacrifice, at least initially. However, countless studies have
shown that steps to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions would
greatly benefit those countries in the future.
The threat to the Marshall Islands is imminent. Our
way of life is threatened. My country is threatened with a
loss of identity and culture. We are powerless in the hands
of others and my country may cease to exist as a result.
I would like everyone in this Hall to visit our corner of
the world before it disappears. I hope that 30 years from
today our islands will not have been swamped by the sea
and that we will be able to invite you again, rather than
referring you to a page in a history book. For many, the
Marshall Islands may be little more than specks on the map.
The peoples of the Pacific hold a very different view of the
world: that the world would be greatly diminished by the
loss of even one of the diverse cultures that have been
crafted by mankind.
Let us strive during the coming months to work in
tandem and to endeavour to fulfil the grand aspirations and
lofty goals that this Organization represents. As we do this,
allow me to offer a Marshallese proverb to guide our work:
'Jouj eo mour eo, lej eo mij eo' - 'Alone we cannot survive,
but together we are strong'.
"
5703,48,1993,NZL,"The United Nations
is our Organization; we are its custodians, and we have to
adjust to change. We have a huge responsibility to pass it
on in better shape than we found it. Historians in future
years will acknowledge this period of radical change.
But what are the objectives of this Organization of ours
in 1993? Well, they are not very difficult to enumerate,
because they are set out for us and by us in the Preamble to
the Charter, and they remain as valid today as they were
when they were agreed in 1945.
The first, of course, is peace, because without peace
and security no human society can flourish; then human
dignity, because if we do not treat each other with respect as
individuals, we will not do so as nations; justice, because
unless relations between nations are grounded in law, the
powerful will always be able to triumph over the weak;
social and economic progress, because without the sustained
and sustainable development of our economies, all our other
achievements will be as nothing.
I believe that to this list we must now add the
maintenance of a clean and attractive environment. We are
learning, painfully, that our planet also has rights. We
ignore them only at our peril.
These are the foundations for the vision of what the
world should be. In New Zealand, we would say that they
give opportunities to all. When the United Nations came
into existence almost 50 years ago, the vision was sharper
than the reality, but the founders of the United Nations were
certainly not deterred. They were at the watershed in the
affairs of the world. They had just experienced the awful
reality of a global conflict in which millions had died, and
they were determined to do everything in their power to
make sure that such a conflict could never occur again.
They did build well. They embodied their vision not only
in this Organization but also in a whole series of economic,
financial, social and humanitarian institutions, and they gave
it the only strength that counted: their sheer determination,
as men and women from very different countries, to make
it happen.
Only the utmost patience and perseverance has kept that
dream and that determination alive through most of the
50 years since 1945. Progress has been slow and it has been
halting. Some great things were done, but too often the
Members of the United Nations could agree only at the
lowest common denominator, a reflection of the political
gaps and strains within the United Nations membership.
There are, however, four reasons why I believe that that
long, grey era has closed.
The first is that the cold war, that shadow and threat of
a global conflict, is now over. Freed of that constraint, the
United Nations can operate, as it was intended that it should,
as the ultimate guardian of the security of all its Members,
the ultimate arbiter of world peace.
Secondly, democracy, one of the most effective
guarantors of peace between nations, is spreading. We
welcome the establishment of democratic institutions and
processes in countries that have for too long been without
them.
The third point is that in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations, the world has a major opportunity to turn its
back on protectionism and lock in the prospects for
economic growth through trade and other forms of economic
integration. Freedom and free trade go hand in hand.
Fourthly, and last, the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
and Agenda 21 contain a global consensus, a universal
determination to act to preserve our environment.
This combination of developments marks a new
watershed; if we are to keep faith with the founders of this
Organization, we must do what they did in 1945 at their
watershed, and build well, not just for ourselves, but of
course for those who follow.
On the issue of security and peacemaking, the first
point that I raised was that the elimination of confrontation
between the super-Powers has opened up new possibilities
for the practice of collective security and peacemaking. The
unfortunate consequence of 50 years of super-Power
confrontation is, paradoxically, that we are not yet very good
at working together: like a novice sports team, we are really
rather uncoordinated, sadly lacking in strategy, sadly lacking
in team skills or knowledge of the new rules, and sadly
lacking in collective determination. We cannot correct these
deficiencies overnight, but we must keep on trying to
improve.
Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 39
The other paradox is that peace has not broken out
simply because the former Soviet Union and the United
States have stopped squaring off against each other. There
have been unexpected consequences: some would liken the
result to taking the lid off a pressure-cooker. Conflicts,
internal and between neighbours, seem to have burst out
everywhere. These consequences, in human terms, are
horrific.
So here we are, in the United Nations, underresourced,
undertrained and facing an enormous peacemaking, peace-
building and peace-keeping challenge. We really have no
alternative to learning as we go, and I believe that we are
doing so.
During the past year, I have spoken to soldiers and
relief workers in the field in United Nations missions as
widely spread as Somalia and Croatia, and I pay my highest
tribute to their dedication under some of the most adverse
circumstances. United Nations people are trying there, as
elsewhere, to create conditions where their work will
ultimately no longer be required. They are actually trying to
do themselves out of a job.
The Secretary-General’s document 'An Agenda for
Peace' is now in a consolidation phase. The problems are
clear: rising expectations; machinery due for reform; lack of
funds; and the lack of ready, well-trained and well-equipped
forces. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already made some
thoughtful proposals, including sending teams to Member
States to help identify in advance resources available for the
United Nations operations. New Zealand is willing to
respond positively to this approach.

The Secretary-General has also made organizational
changes in the Headquarters departments that support peace-
keeping. The revamping of the Department of Peace-
Keeping Operations is a very good start, providing we
recognize that we need more than just a shifting of the
resources. The new philosophy of peace-building and
peacemaking must work in tandem with the well-tried and
successful peace-keeping philosophy of the past.
On the issue of safety and security of United Nations
personnel, recent peace-keeping operations have highlighted
the risks to United Nations personnel working in dangerous
and unstable situations. That does not help the recruitment
of peace-keepers, and it does not help the recruitment of
contributing countries. The United Nations must have the
means to hold personally responsible and accountable those
who attack or commit other acts of violence against the
United Nations and associated personnel.
Earlier this year the New Zealand Government took the
initial step of calling for all possible measures to ensure the
safety of United Nations personnel. We asked the Secretary-
General to report on the adequacy of existing arrangements.
His report makes a number of positive recommendations.
He has highlighted the need for the General Assembly to
elaborate a new multilateral instrument on the role the
Security Council might play in setting the appropriate
conditions designed to improve the safety of personnel.
I was very pleased just this afternoon to participate in
a Security Council meeting that adopted a resolution
welcoming the Secretary-General’s report and spelling out
the conditions the Council will impose in the future for the
protection of United Nations personnel. I was also delighted
that the General Assembly last week agreed to New
Zealand’s proposal to include a new item on the safety of
personnel in this year’s agenda. I hope that the Sixth
Committee will establish a working group to consider the
issue and make urgent progress. I hope the subject will also
be very fully discussed in all other relevant United Nations
bodies.
Of course, any mechanisms for protecting peace-keepers
must also require that parties to any conflict respect the
integrity of those personnel that have been deployed on their
behalf. Such an undertaking should, in principle, form part
of the mandate for any peace-keeping operation. The recent
practice of the Security Council of establishing clear
mandates for peace-keeping operations at the outset of
deployment is especially welcome, but there remains an onus
on a host State both to explain carefully to its people the
reason for the United Nations presence and also to take
active steps to ensure the safety of United Nations personnel.
But the purpose of peace-keeping or peacemaking and
peace-building is not solely to deal with conflicts that have
already arisen, urgent though that task is. We must improve
our capacity to prevent conflicts before they break out, and
I should like to acknowledge here the importance and
timeliness of recent improvements in conflict-resolution
mechanisms and the ongoing work on preventive diplomacy.
I welcome very warmly the contribution made by my
Australian colleague, Senator Gareth Evans, to the debate on
this subject. He has given us much food for thought and
some helpful suggestions for concrete steps we can take to
improve our performance in this area.
40 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
Disarmament measures remain a key element in conflict
prevention. This year, as the international community
moves towards the extension - I hope for an indefinite
period - of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, the Assembly will have non-proliferation as one
of its major themes. In this regard, North Korea’s continued
evasion of its responsibilities under that Treaty demands a
firm international response.
We welcome very strongly the restraint being shown by
the nuclear-weapon States on testing and their positive
attitude towards the launching of negotiations for a
comprehensive test-ban treaty. It is not before time. New
Zealand has sponsored a draft resolution on comprehensive
test-bans for many years. Its purpose now is on the brink of
fulfillment. The subject needs to be taken up in the
Conference on Disarmament. Given the importance of the
tasks now on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament,
membership of the Conference must be open to all who have
the will to participate constructively.
In respect of conventional weaponry, we applaud the
enhancement of controls through the commencement of the
Register of conventional-arms transfers. We now have a
chemical weapons Convention in place alongside the
biological weapons Convention.
It is timely to consider what similar work can be done
in respect of conventional weapons. As disarmament moves
from the realms of Utopia into the achievable, we must lend
every effort, here in the United Nations and outside it, to
ensure disarmament’s more rapid progress. No sensible
proposal should be discarded simply for outdated ideological
reasons.
The spread of democratic institutions to every corner of
the globe is, I believe, one of the most encouraging
phenomena of recent years, and the pace is astonishing. In
the space of just 24 hours last week, the Parliament of Israel
approved a Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self-
government; the Parliament of South Africa enacted
legislation establishing the Transitional Executive Council to
take charge of that country until a democratically elected
Government is in office; and a constitutional Government
took office in Cambodia.
We welcome these historic events and the promise they
hold for a more just and prosperous existence for the peoples
of those nations. As delegations will remember, the Middle
East and South Africa dominated the political agenda of the
Assembly for many years. These positive developments in
both regions will give a new cast to the Assembly’s
deliberations.
We can also take heart from progress on another front
of long-standing concern to the Assembly. The United
Nations is now three years into the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism. The good news is that we
are already seeing evidence that the goals and objectives of
the United Nations in this area are almost completely
realized. The number of Self-Governing Territories on the
United Nations list is now very small, and many of these are
exploring innovative ways to complete the decolonization
process. The recent United Nations Seminar on Colonialism,
held in Papua-New Guinea in June, confirmed this trend. It
also revealed that in some cases some very small Non-Self-
Governing Territories do not want fundamental constitutional
change thrust upon them.
New Zealand has always been a strong advocate of the
principle that in all cases decisions on self-determination are,
of course, for the local people to make. We are comfortable
with the notion that certain Territories, such as the Tokelaus,
may finally choose to develop concepts of self-government
and free association that further develop models that have
already been successfully employed for other very small
former Territories.
In that connection, and consistent with New Zealand’s
principled approach to all matters of decolonization, I am
pleased to confirm that the New Zealand Government and
the people of the Tokelaus have extended an invitation to the
United Nations to send a further visiting mission to the
Tokelaus early in 1994 to meet local leaders and, of course,
discuss recent developments.
Democracy is a sure foundation for peace between
nations. It is the political expression of that universal
respect for human rights to which we are all committed.
The Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action arising out of
this year’s World Conference on Human Rights gives some
direction to steps the Organization can take to strengthen the
observance of human rights.
I believe we should move quickly to approve a high
commissioner for human rights. The United Nations needs
an officer with a mandate to play a constructive role in
preventing, monitoring and alleviating human rights abuses
throughout the world. The Centre for Human Rights should
be given the resources to match the immense task it will
have before it. There is a clear need for an enhanced
programme of advisory services and technical assistance to
Forty-eighth session - 29 September l993 41
help countries build up their national human rights
infrastructure.
Human rights is also about recognizing the rights of
peoples to self-identity. In this, the International Year for
the World’s Indigenous People, I would like to support a
proposal that the United Nations declare a decade for
indigenous peoples. We need to build on what has been
achieved, first at Rio de Janeiro and subsequently during the
International Year world wide. This is a long-term task. It
will require a sustained and very coordinated effort.
Unhappily, our task is not just to enhance the
observance of human rights. In this last decade of the
twentieth century, we seem at times to be actually moving
backwards, witnessing the abuse and deprivation of human
rights on a scale that we really believed we had put a long
way behind us. The suffering of millions of refugees
displaced by conflict is beyond our comprehension but
cannot and should not be beyond our compassion. This
dimension is starkly evident in nearly every issue now
before the Security Council. Last June, the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees put the
figure at 19 million people - 19 million displaced people
around the world - and it continues to rise.
It is appropriate to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ogata
and her staff for the way in which they are meeting, often in
dangerous and trying circumstances, the challenges which
this problem brings. New Zealand has responded to these
increased demands by making a special provision for
refugees from Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia by
establishing special programmes for particularly vulnerable
groups, such as women at risk, and by providing aid. We
now have one of the highest per capita resettlement ratios in
the world. But this is, of course, addressing the symptoms,
not the cause. The ultimate objective must be to create or
recreate conditions that allow refugees to return in safety and
dignity to their own homes and homelands.
Nor can we neglect the need to bring to justice those
who have brought about such suffering. The establishment
of a war crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is
certainly a central pillar in the international response to this
particular conflict. The full achievement of the Tribunal’s
mandate is of the highest priority. At the same time, and in
a broader context, New Zealand also welcomes the
consideration being given to the creation of an international
criminal court. We would like to see further progress on
this issue made during this session of the Assembly.
Sustainable economic growth for all countries is
essential for stability and peace in the world. A principal
determinant for that is an open, healthy and international
trading system, a system that encourages closer economic
relations and strengthened North-South exchanges. There is
no greater assistance developed countries can give to the
developing countries than to open their markets. A
satisfactory conclusion to the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade negotiations would be of immense benefit to us all and
has been mentioned, I believe, by just about every speaker
on this rostrum during this debate.
Progress to that end in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, of course, has been slow, as we know.
Many deadlines have come and many deadlines have gone
without resolution. We should not be under any illusion.
Come this December, after seven years of negotiations on
the Uruguay Round, either we will have the liberalization of
multilateral trade with a benefit to all or the prospects of
avoiding global economic warfare will have suffered the
most serious setback. The New Zealand Government sees
the purpose of these negotiations being to lock in place
today the politically attainable, and to build on what might
be possible tomorrow. In preparing for that, we also have
to focus our attention on what is needed to ensure that all
countries are placed where they can reap the benefits of the
future.
We still have much to follow up from the Rio
Conference on Environment and Development. But time is
not on our side. Environmental degradation continues to
pose a serious threat to the planet and its resources, and no
country - no country - is immune from its impact. The
levels of responsibility for environmental damage may differ
from country to country, but we must face up to their
consequences together. We must meet the objectives of
Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration. All countries should
move to ratify the climate and biodiversity Conventions, a
step that New Zealand took just recently. New Zealand will
contribute to the global environmental facility that is to fund
both of those Conventions. We have begun work to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions and are developing a
comprehensive strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas
emissions. We are also making excellent progress on
phasing out consumption of ozone-depleting chemicals.
New Zealand is ready to share its expertise on biological
diversity with other countries to assist them in meeting
obligations under the Conventions.
I suppose that one of the most useful exercises that we
can conclude here is to draw some lessons from the
experiences and views that I have set out. The most obvious
42 General Assembly - Forty-eighth session
one to me is that, however important it is to deal with the
particularities of human aspirations for peace, respect for the
individual, economic well-being and a good, clean
environment, one should never lose sight of the connections
between them all. The Secretary-General has pointed out
how peace, development and democracy form a mutually
reinforcing circle, and we agree. Getting the linkages right
can be as important for success as the elements of each.
Peace and security are not likely to be soundly based if
people are hungry. Economic growth cannot last if the
natural resources used to create it are not conserved. People
are not likely to make the effort required by economic
restructuring if the important choices are made for them.
Economic growth cannot be sustained if countries keep
coming up with new pretexts, such as environmental
protection, to justify excluding outside competition from
their own markets.
Human aspirations and human security must be seen in
the round. That is one of the major challenges facing the
membership of this Organization. The work done by the
United Nations in post-peace-keeping situations, I believe,
deserves renewed attention. For those countries where there
is still a need to foster economic, political and social
development, we should look at establishing a partnership
arrangement between the United Nations and the sovereign
Government. A coordinating body comprising the
Governments and a group of friends of the Secretariat could
help to ensure that the gains of peace-keeping are taken
through to reconstruction. I believe that we need a new
institutional framework to graduate problems out of the
security area and into a forum more able to cope with the
needs of redevelopment and reconstruction.
The second lesson is that we need to keep looking at
how well the United Nations is fitted to meet the challenges
it is facing and be prepared to change it where necessary.
Membership of the United Nations has continued to grow
and I warmly welcome the newest Member States.
Many speakers have referred to Security Council
reform. The Security Council is in need of early reform.
We support a modest increase in membership and a fresh
look at the institution as a whole. The possibility of some
members representing regional groupings for, say, a 10-year
period is worth considering. New Zealand will continue to
oppose any extension of veto rights.
Another imperative is for the Council’s work methods
to be improved. Wider consultation with the broader
membership of the United Nations is essential. United
Nations agencies are also ripe for restructuring. The General
Assembly has made a good start on itself. We have
streamlined the Committees, but we also must streamline the
overall workload. It is unmanageable at present.
For several years now, we have been looking hard at
ways to fund new demands on the Organization by making
compensating savings elsewhere. We still need to ask hard
questions about whether all that has been done traditionally
still needs to be done. I welcome the fact that the Secretary-
General’s budget proposals already envisage some major
steps in this area. He has also identified better contracting
as a source of further savings.
At the end of the day, however, all that can be done to
increase efficiency and cut costs will come to naught if the
financial commitment by Member States is lacking. New
Zealand pays its dues on time; most others do not. I urge
them to do so. Let us certainly go on talking about financial
reform, but let us also secure the financial basis of the
Organization while we are doing so.
But what is the real dream that all of us have? I would
urge all members to keep making, from year to year, real
progress towards satisfying those basic human aspirations I
mentioned at the outset and to do so with a strong, well-
equipped and well-focused United Nations. Specifically, I
want to see a reshaped Security Council, a more tightly
focused General Assembly, better peace-keeping practice, a
Secretariat equipped to handle peace-building and partnership
arrangements, and financial arrangements built on efficiency
and punctuality. Would that not give a point to the fiftieth
anniversary celebrations that lie ahead in 1995, and would it
not make the United Nations of the next 50 years a more
effective, more dynamic and exciting place to do the world’s
business in than the conditions of the last 50 years have
allowed? The deprived of this world expect no less. The
well-off know the world is too small for the huge gap that
now exists amongst all people to remain.
"
5736,32,1977,PNG,"﻿ Two years ago, on the occasion of Papua New Guinea's admission to membership in the United Nations, I had the honour to address the thirtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly.1 Since then Papua New Guinea has held national elections, and I now avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm Papua New Guinea's support of and continuing commitment to the principles of the United Nations.
1.	Papua New Guinea wishes to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to your high office. The task that you have been given is not an easy one, as the outcome of this session of the General Assembly will depend largely on your guidance. I wish you well in this task.
2.	I wish also to pay a tribute to your predecessor, Ambassador Amerasinghe of Sri Lanka, who performed his duties as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly with distinction.
3.	I should also like to place on record Papua New Guinea's appreciation for the work done by the Secretary- General and his staff.
4.	It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the people of Papua New Guinea, to extend a warm welcome to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti as new Members of the United Nations. 
5.	Papua New Guinea is still a very young Member of the United Nations family and is only now becoming aware of the full scope of the Organization. Our experience with the United Nations has, so far, been .limited to a number of the special bodies of the Organization and its related agencies. These are already making a valuable contribution to Papua New Guinea's development.
6.	There are numerous United Nations conferences and meetings held every year on many and varied technical matters. In view of our limited resources, we have carefully selected the conferences to which we could send representatives, but now we must ask whether the diversity and complexity of the matters considered by the United Nations family have not grown so great that this Organization is losing its effectiveness. Papua New Guinea hopes that a cautious review of this problem could be made.
7.	Papua New Guinea attended the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London in June and came away from it with a sense of achievement. The Commonwealth has proved that it can play an effective role in the field of international affairs, and we therefore applaud the decision taken at the last General Assembly session to grant the Commonwealth Secretariat observer status within the United Nations 
8.	Papua New Guinea has been involved, through direct participation, in programmes of action and development undertaken by the world community to create a peaceful and balanced world order, especially in the field of international trade. We have also followed with much interest the current North-South dialogue at the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. We deeply regret that the results of that Conference fell short of expectations. Papua New Guinea will continue its active participation in the meetings under the auspices of UNCTAD, particularly in relation to the Integrated Programme for Commodities with the common fund. We should like to see a much firmer commitment by the parties involved on these two particular issues. This commitment should be one based on an honest and realistic exploration of all avenues, because failing to do so may well lead to inappropriate and inadequate solutions, and certainly not to the new international economic order we all wish to see.
9.	My Government has noted with concern the failure so far of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to reach a successful conclusion. Papua New Guinea is among those countries which have felt obliged to take action to extend fishing limits to protect their resources. We acknowledge, however, that this kind of individual self-help is a poor substitute for a generally-accepted treaty. The Conference also failed to meet the just demands of the third world for a fair and equitable regime to govern the exploitation of the deep-sea-bed.
10.	In the absence of a new treaty, the general extension of fishing limits has created a special challenge for the countries of the South Pacific. Most of Us in the South Pacific are developing countries; some lack any resources of economic value except fish. Fisheries management has presented these countries with a new opportunity for regional co-operation. However, we know that this is a field in which rich and powerful countries can gain benefits at the expense of the smaller, less-developed nations. Papua New Guinea is a small country, but we are determined to resist exploitation by foreign fishing interests. We are also determined to see that the policy of regional co-operation takes account of the interests of our developing neighbours, including those not yet fully independent and those smaller than ourselves.
11.	Papua New Guinea was honoured to welcome Samoa, another member of the Pacific group, into the United Nations at the last session. We hope that with the admission of more Pacific countries into the United Nations and other agencies the voice of the South Pacific can now be clearly heard.
12.	The South Pacific region is often thought to consist of many small island-nations without regional identity. That is no longer true: the region now has an identity in the South Pacific Forum, and we hope that decisions made by that body will be given due consideration by the United Nations, its related agencies and all Member nations. .
13.	Papua New Guinea is an ardent supporter of the decolonization process, and we note with considerable gratification that our near neighbour, the Solomon Islands, will become independent next year. It is the hope of Papua New Guinea that all of the few remaining colonies, not only within the South Pacific area but world-wide, will achieve self-determination within the immediate future.
14.	I should now like to speak about some of the major international issues before the General Assembly. Of particular concern to Papua New Guinea are developments in southern Africa.
15.	First, as regards Rhodesia, Papua New Guinea strongly supports a negotiated settlement between the parties involved. We welcome efforts by the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America to seek a constitutional settlement there. We would not support the use of force in any settlement of this question. We have already made it clear at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting that we should like to see majority rule in Rhodesia. Any settlement there must fully ensure the rights of the black African majority.
16.	Papua New Guinea condemns the situation in southern Africa, where the rights of the people are totally suppressed by small white minorities. Full pressure should be brought to bear on these minority regimes to ensure an equitable settlement in southern Africa. Papua New Guinea fully supports the present sanctions imposed upon South Africa and Rhodesia. However, we have serious reservations about their effectiveness, particularly when influential Members of this Organization do not play their part by enforcing them.
17.	My country recently banned trade with South Africa. Although trade between Papua New Guinea and South Africa was very small, we wish to play our part in enforcing the sanctions. We call upon other, more influential Members of the United Nations to be totally honest in enforcing the agreed sanctions. We feel that the racist regime will continue to oppress the majority of the people of South Africa as long as Members of this Organization continue illegally to trade or associate with this racist regime.
18.	While we are concerned at illegal white minority regimes that cause suffering to black people in southern Africa, Papua New Guinea is also gravely concerned that in Uganda there is a black regime which resorts to oppression of its own people. This must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by this Assembly, and we urge that consideration should be given to ways in which this Assembly can help to alleviate suffering in that country.
19.	In addition to the appalling denial of human rights already mentioned, there are instances of many other countries denying their citizens basic human rights. Such violations must be strongly condemned. It is the view of my Government that this Organization must take appropriate action to ensure that all people of all races are accorded the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Charter and other instruments of the United Nations.
20.	Another area of grave concern to us is the continuing development and testing of new types of nuclear weapons. In the past we have strongly opposed the testing of such weapons, particularly in the Pacific region, and we will continue to do so. That the testing of nuclear weapons has not been totally banned is a matter to be regretted, and 1 urge all nations to co-operate in the search for an effective means of controlling those weapons of mass destruction.
21.	There is one further issue that I must mention. That is the question of resolving the conflict situation in the Middle East. We commend the diplomatic initiatives taken by the United States of America on this problem and have sincere hopes of their success. It is essential that there be an early resumption of the Geneva negotiations. We hold the view that a Palestinian State must be given recognition but, on the other hand, we firmly believe that Israel must not be denied the right to exist as a sovereign State.
22.	I have touched on a number of issues of real concern to the world community and hope that this session will find lasting solutions to those and many other issues to be debated in this forum. Finally, I wish to reiterate the view of my Government that our involvement and participation in international affairs reflects the genuine values that our people have and their aspirations to live in a peaceful world. We shall continue to be mindful of developments on the international scene and the likely implications for Papua
New Guinea and the region of which we are part. Papua New Guinea will continue to contribute, within its limited resources, to the objectives of this Organization and to accept our share of the responsibilities of membership in the United Nations and the international community.
 


"
5819,32,1977,NZL,"﻿74.	 Mr. President, I offer you my warmest congratulations on your election as President of this Assembly. It is at once a notable mark of confidence in you personally and a timely acknowledgement of your country's standing in the world community.
75.	We welcome as new Members the Republic of Djibouti and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. New Zealand was privileged to be a sponsor of Viet Nam's application for membership. We did so not merely because of our belief in the value of universal membership of the United Nations, but because we regard the participation of Viet Nam as indispensable in the task of solving the pressing problems of South-East Asia. We look forward to developing a positive relationship with this dynamic State both within the United Nations system and in our direct bilateral dealings.
76.	This year's General Assembly, like its predecessors, confronts awesome problems which we human beings have created and which—we must believe—human beings have the intelligence to solve, if only we can summon the will and forge the consensus. Our Secretary-General has pinpointed the issues in his valuable report. Many of them have been with us for a long time. Others, as he notes, are new. All directly affect the peace, security and welfare of our fragile world community. Indeed, they are basic to its continued functioning and even to its continued existence.
77.	Whether the issue be the softening of the expensive and potentially deadly rivalry between the super-Power?;, whether it be the establishment of human justice for all the people of southern Africa and the Middle East, whether it be the imperative of a more just and workable international economic order, whether it be the conservation and orderly use of the resources of the sea and the sea-bed, whether it be the sensible management and sharing of the finite resources of this planet, whether it be the halting and reversal of the arms race-whatever the issue, all of us have a direct stake in the outcome. No one of us can opt out. All of us face the challenge; all of us will share the responsibility if we fail to find solutions and then uphold them in good faith.
78.	It would, of course, be naive to pretend that this body is an objective research institution or a philanthropic agency, or that national or regional interests are likely to be set aside, or that advances will be made except step by step through deals and compromises. That is the nature of national or international political institutions, of which this is one. We represent our constituents, and they have their interests and their aspirations, to which we must be responsive. But all of us, I think, can feel in our bones that in its economic, no less than its political, condition the world is not many steps away from chaos; and that for all of us the consequences of failure are so grave that, however intractable the problems, however elusive the solutions, we are called upon to make the effort to face them with seriousness and compassion. We are then in the area of attitudes. Attitudes determine political will, and without a shift of attitudes the indispensable consensus will continue to elude us.
79.	No issue calls more urgently for agreement among us than that of the more just and effective use of the world's economic resources. It is at our peril that we should ignore the fact that one third of our fellow beings are subsisting in conditions of destitution and mounting despair, that, after two decades of international consideration and some, but all too little, action, development problems have increased in magnitude, that, despite dozens of conferences, the relative position of the people of the developing countries has each year steadily deteriorated.
80.	in recently reviewing the decline in the terms of trade of countless which produce agricultural exports, and considering measures such as the supplementary financing facility established by the IMF, my Prime Minister made this observation:
'We cannot say to a poor country, 'We will pay you much less in relative terms for your goods than we used to pay, but you need not worry as we will lend you the balance at market rates of interest providing you take the steps to lower the standard of living of your people.' It is difficult,' he said, 'to cut what you haven't got.'
81.	As an exporter of agricultural products, New Zealand has suffered greatly from declining terms of trade and, I might add, from the social burdens involved in adjusting to a greatly reduced income. We are therefore well placed to understand the far greater difficulties of the oil-deficient developing countries. We claim no special sympathy for New Zealand because we are well placed by comparison with most of the world's population. But our difficulties stem from causes similar to some of those which frustrate the developing world: declining terms of trade for countries which export agricultural goods and Increasing protectionism on the part of the affluent industrial countries. In many countries belts have already been tightened up to, and beyond, what is socially and politically acceptable. We must all think in terms not of palliatives but of fundamental shifts of attitudes and policies.
82.	In such a situation more attention must be given, not just to financing deficits and tightening the belt, but to enabling the primary producing and newly industrializing countries to increase their earnings. And this must involve facing squarely two fundamental questions, namely, the relationship between the prices of primary products and industrial goods, and the question of access to the markets of the affluent industrial countries of the world. These are political questions of the greatest importance, questions that must be tackled by those in whose power it lies to diminish both surpluses and deficits. And surely it must be obvious that for the rich, industrialized world to do so would be no more than enlightened self-interest. Could it not help to revitalize their faltering economies and to provide their societies with a renewed purpose and sense of direction?
83.	The problem is, of course, at the very essence of politics. It is the far from easy task of convincing electorates and, more specifically, of ensuring that special interest groups in those electorates are harnessed to wider national and international imperatives. We are convinced that most of the leaders of countries whose policies will determine the course of the world's economy, and the social and political ramifications of those policies, are aware of what must be done if the looming economic and political chaos is to be avoided. Their problem, and the problem of all in government, is to mobilize sufficient determination and creative leadership to change entrenched attitudes and to confront those interests which, however obsolete they may be, are nevertheless deeply entrenched in their national history and their political processes. But time is short, and it is running out.
84.	I have concentrated some attention on She responsibilities of the affluent market-economy nations, but it is not only their problem. It is the problem of all, regardless of ideology, regardless of economic system.
85.	There appears to be a general recognition that it is within the United Nations framework that the efforts of the international community to promote such action should be carried forward. The present session of the General Assembly has a special responsibility to put in hand preparations for a new international development strategy. The conclusions and agreements of the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation held earlier this year need to be followed up.
86.	New Zealand was not a participant at the Paris Conference. We have, however, welcomed the progress made, and my Government has now completed its study of the measures agreed at that Conference. We endorse the agreements reached, limited though these were, and will take up the debate in the various forums concerned on the topics left uncompleted.
87.	An important element in our efforts to promote development and greater equity in the distribution of the world's resources is, of course, international energy cooperation, with particular reference to the interests and needs of energy-deficient developing countries. We are encouraged that the Secretary-General has recently made proposals for such co-operation within the United Nations system, and we shall play our part in working out this concept in the course of this session and thereafter.
88.	It is now almost three years since the World Food Conference decided to establish an International Fund for Agricultural Development. The Fund represents a new approach to the age-old problem of world hunger-the pooling, on a hitherto unprecedented scale, of resources to be devoted exclusively to improving agriculture in developing countries. The Fund's initial pledging target of SI billion was achieved at the beginning of the year, and the Agreement establishing the Fund was thrown open for signature in February. New Zealand will formally ratify the agreement today. We look forward to its early entry into force and the fulfilment of initial pledges by donor countries so that operations may begin.
89.	New Zealand will also participate actively and constructively in the resumed session of the United Nations Negotiating Conference on a Common Fund under the Integrated Programme for Commodities. We earn our living by the export of primary produce, and therefore share the concern of developing countries that greater stability should be introduced into the commodity markets of the world.
90.	New Zealand is experiencing the most prolonged and deep-seated recession in its post-war economic history. This fact has sharpened our appreciation of the lot of developing countries. It has, however, circumscribed our ability to help those beyond our shores, but we remain pledged to the target of 0.7 per cent for official development assistance, and we shall move again towards that target as soon as our economic circumstances permit.
91.	In our interdependent world there are no issues that can be considered in isolation. The refashioning of the global economic system is closely linked to negotiating settlements in southern Africa and the Middle East, to halting the arms race, and to controlling and ultimately eliminating weapons of mass destruction. The more we can establish conditions of security and stability the more chance there is of securing the massive diversion of resources and the rearrangement of economic activity needed to reduce the unacceptable disparities that new exist among nations. How, then, do we address these problems?
92.	All of us agree that the situation in southern Africa is a tragedy, c tragedy compounded by intransigence and repression, a tragedy of expanding and enveloping dimensions. Change must come, and it will come. The question is not if, but how. Here, of course, there is less agreement.
93.	Some claim that armed struggle is the only way; and if intransigence persists they will, of course, be right. But it is a way that would extract a terrible price in human lives and suffering and would create bitter problems for the future.
94.	When the Anglo-American proposals on Rhodesia were announced, I said publicly that they offered the last chance for a peaceful settlement. If the Smith regime tosses this chance away it might buy itself a little time, but it can only be a time of tension and a time of knowing that the end will almost certainly be bloodshed in Salisbury and Bulawayo. I would urge the Smith regime to realize it, not only for their own sake,- but also for the sake of Zimbabwe as a whole.
95.	There has been some progress on Namibia. The southern African authorities have apparently recognized the futility of pressing ahead with the Turnhalle proposals and have accepted the need for elections on the basis of one man, one vote. The Maputo Conference showed them, if they needed any showing, that the international community is united in its demand that Namibia should be free and independent. But if there has been some progress, there remain formidable problems. One of the most taxing is that of Walvis Bay. There can be no question that any exclusion of Walvis Bay from Namibia would undermine that country's integrity and impede significantly its chances of building a viable economy.
96.	The gravest problems are those of South Africa. They are complex and deep-rooted. And they are on a huge scale. White South Africa remains to be convinced that it has no alternative but to accept fundamental changes of attitude. Even a society that is as inward-looking and as determined to go its own way as South Africa cannot survive alone. It is part of the world whether it likes it or not. If the rest of the world makes it clear that it will have nothing to do with
South Africa so long as it persists with its discriminatory policies, the pressure for change will sooner or later become irresistible.
97.	We in New Zealand have played our part in this process. We took part in the Lagos World Conference for Action against Apartheid and subscribed, without reservation, to the terms of the Lagos Declaration. We have minimal trade with South Africa and virtually no investment. We have supported the Swedish initiative calling for the ending of all new investment in South Africa. We have refused to contemplate any exchange of diplomatic representatives. My Government is actively discouraging sporting contacts. We support the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the appeal for South African refugee students. We are opposed to the creation of the so-called 'Bantustans'' which would seek to make black South Africans aliens in their own country. We have scrupulously observed the voluntary arms embargo and will give our full support to any proposal to establish a mandatory arms embargo in terms of the appropriate provisions of the Charter. We have taken a forthright stand in pressing for the release of political prisoners and in condemning the brutal treatment which has led to the unexplained deaths in confinement of more than one black leader-most recently Steven Biko. In short, we shall do all we can to bring about the atmosphere in which a just solution of the problems of racism and minority rule in South Africa might be achieved before a long, drawn-out and bloody armed struggle becomes inevitable.
98.	The Arab-Israeli dispute is another problem that threatens world peace. It is a dispute about which we have little direct knowledge and we are certainly not well placed to presume to offer any new ideas on how it can be resolved. Even so, it seems to us that certain things stand out. One is that Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338(1973) must continue to form the basis-for any settlement. We are obliged, therefore, to reject any attempt by one party to the dispute to pursue policies that are contrary to the principles laid down in resolution 242(1967). We believe that territory occupied by Israel must be returned.
99.	The second thing is that the Palestinian people have a right to a homeland, either as a separate State or as a part of a larger, Arab State. The precise boundaries of that homeland are a matter for negotiations by the parties directly concerned. But if there is to be a peace in the Middle East, the principle must be recognized. It does not derogate in any way from the fundamental right of Israel to exist as a sovereign, independent State within secure and recognized boundaries, free from threat by any acts of force, and indeed we believe that a final territorial settlement will confirm and help to protect that right.
100.	And, finally, it is imperative that negotiations begin soon. The longer a start is delayed, the greater the build-up of tension and the greater the chances of the outbreak of another war. Obviously, to be constructive, negotiations must include all the parties to the dispute, including the Palestinians, through their chosen representatives.
101.	In another long-standing dispute, that between North and South Korea, the resumption of early negotiations between the parties directly concerned is, in our view, an urgent requirement. My Government remains deeply concerned lest the tensions on the peninsula should lead, once again, to confrontation. It is our earnest hope that, during the pause in international deliberations on the problem, a peaceful solution can be found through negotiations between the two Korean parties. New Zealand hopes that all Governments which are in a position to encourage this peaceful means to a solution will use their influence accordingly.
102.	We have a deep concern also for the security and prosperity of South-East Asia. We therefore welcome the co-operative, constructive efforts of the countries of the region through the Association of South-East Asian Nations. ASEAN is a non-military association dedicated to the establishment of peace and stability in South-East Asia. Its leaders have made clear on many occasions their desire to promote friendship and understanding with their neighbours. We hope they will soon get a response. For our part we are glad to be associated with ASEAN in its efforts to improve the well-being of the people of this area.
103.	This same developing regional co-operation is to be found so in our own part of the world, the South Pacific. There, the South Pacific Forum, a group of ten States, five of which are represented in this Assembly, is the principal vehicle for co-operation and consultation. Two of the Forum's recent initiative deserve particular mention. In June it was agreed to establish a regional shipping line, the Pacific Forum Line. Ships are to be chartered to the Line by participating Governments and it will operate services within the region, commencing early next year. Sea transport, of course, is the key to economic development in the region and the Forum Line will open new possibilities.
104.	The second major initiative was the agreement of the Forum, at its most recent meeting in Papua New Guinea, to establish a fisheries agency to co-ordinate and develop protection and surveillance of fisheries within the economic zones of member countries. The proper control of this huge area, which in total is one of the largest in the world, is clearly beyond the capability of any one member country. By sharing their skills and knowledge, the members will be able to exploit their resources to the best advantage of all countries in the region. At the same time the establishment of exclusive economic zones in the South Pacific and of a regional fishing agency in no way diminishes the importance for the area of the early completion of the treaty on the law of the sea. It is our earnest hope that negotiations will result in an agreed text during 1978.
105.	Before I leave the subject of regional co-operation I should like to refer, very briefly, to the signing on 7 September in Washington of the Panama Canal Treaties. This is a significant advance which my Government welcomes. We see the agreements as a milestone for the principal parties, the United States and the Republic of Panama, for the Americas as a whole, and for countries as far flung as my own. The large volume of our trade which passes through the Canal causes us to take a positive interest in its security and efficiency. I warmly congratulate the Governments concerned.
106.	The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the basic purposes of the United Nations and next year will be the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. New Zealand attaches great importance to the Universal Declaration and to the values enunciated in the International Covenants on Human Rights, the one covering political and civil rights, the other economic, social and cultural rights.
107.	Before formally committing ourselves to the Covenants we have sought to ensure that in every respect our laws and juridical system were capable of enforcing the obligations of those Covenants. This has been a lengthy task involving the drafting of new legislation. That task is now substantially completed. Enactment of this legislation will mean that our laws will sustain any scrutiny under the Covenants. I expect, therefore, that we will ratify both those Covenants, as well as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide not later than 1978. Respect for human rights, for human dignity and the individual's fundamental freedoms have long had a central place in our traditions and values. Through this codification the law in fact will have caught up with our practice.
108.	In preparing for the ratification of the Covenants the New Zealand Government has drafted, and Parliament is expected to adopt during the current parliamentary session, a measure which will outlaw every kind of discrimination based on sex or religion. Racial discrimination is already contrary to New Zealand tradition, law and practice and New Zealand reports regularly to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Under the new legislation a national commission of human rights will be established to deal with complaints of racial, religious or sexual discrimination. This legislation should facilitate New Zealand's signature and ratification of the draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women when it is adopted—in the preparation of which New Zealand has taken an active part. We hope it will be completed and opened for signature at the present session of the Assembly.
109.	I have touched on a number of problems and I want now to turn to the most menacing of all-the arms race. No other issue before this Assembly creates greater hopes and engenders greater despair. The gap between our aspirations and our achievements frustrates and dispirits us, and that gap must be closed.
110.	There has been some progress. It is encouraging that at last serious negotiations have begun among three of the nuclear-weapon States on the content of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. This will provide the most effective restriction on vertical nuclear proliferation so far and is clearly the first priority. We hope that a generally accepted comprehensive test-ban treaty will have been drafted by the time the special session is held. No other development, in our judgement, would provide a happier augury for the success of that session. We do not consider acceptable to wait for technology to solve all the political problems confronting a test ban. This would be to wait indefinitely and perhaps for ever. The time for action is now.
111.	None of the great issues before this Assembly are capable of quick or simple solution. But we can make a start, and if the will is present we can move progressively and consistently to the settlement of our disputes, to the changing of attitudes and to the reconciliation of our differences. The New Zealand delegation approaches this session of the Assembly determined to work conscientiously towards that objective.
 

"
5863,32,1977,AUS,"﻿30.	 Mr. President, I begin by offering you my congratulations and good wishes as you commence the task of steering the General Assembly through its thirty-second session. I have no doubt that you will serve this Assembly with distinction, and I offer you the full co-operation of my delegation. I wish to take this opportunity also to express my Government's recognition of the continuing contribution made to the United Nations by Ambassador Amerasinghe, particularly in the high office of President of the General Assembly, in which he preceded you, and in the office of President of the Third United Nations Conference on the law of the Sea. Yugoslavia has much to contribute to the functioning of the United Nations and to the furtherance of harmony among nations. Yugoslavia's distinctive role in international affairs is fittingly recognized in your election to the presidency of this General Assembly.
31.	Let me also say that last year we welcomed Samoa to membership, and I am delighted and indeed honoured to be following today my friend, the Prime Minister of Samoa.
32.	This year, of course, two new Members have joined us. As Chairman of the group of Western European and other States for the current month, the Australian delegation has already had an opportunity to express a welcome to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Republic of Djibouti. May I add that we look forward to full co-operation with them across the broad range of the United Nations agenda.
33.	Every year we are all faced with the problem of how best to use our time on this rostrum—what subjects and themes to focus on, how wide or narrow a range of subjects to cover. I have decided to be very selective on this occasion, to speak on central issues which are of common and immediate concern to all Members and all peoples, whatever their more particular interests and preoccupations: namely, the issues of nuclear arms control and disarmament; energy; North-South relations; human rights; and the particular problems posed by the two areas of most acute crisis in the world today, southern Africa and the Middle East.
34.	It has been possible during the last few years to discern a fundamental shift in emphasis in our agenda. This has been a reflection of the objective fact of a new interdependence and at the same time a much greater awareness of that fact. But there is one crucial item which is as important on the new agenda as it was on the old: the issue of nuclear arms control.
35.	The first concern of mankind must be the avoidance of nuclear conflict. If we fail in that, we fail in everything. We shall no longer be living in a recognizable world, if indeed we are living at all. The issue is not one which will stand still; things must get better or they will get very much worse. And we are very close to the point of no return.
36.	It is therefore enormously important and appropriate that there will be a special session of the General Assembly on disarmament in 1978. This special session is not intended to provide a forum for the negotiation of new agreements. But it is intended to give new stimulus and focus to international efforts in the whole field of arms control and disarmament, to make an important contribution to a new consensus on priorities for future negotiations and to review ways in which existing negotiating machinery can be made more effective. These are urgent tasks.
37.	The central issues of nuclear arms control, as I said here last year, are: the achievement of universal adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban agreement and its acceptance by all States; and continued progress by the United States and the Soviet Union in their negotiations on strategic arms limitations.
38.	It is essential that the linkage between progress towards these goals be fully appreciated. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the nuclear- weapon States have undertaken to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race This obligation is one facet of a three-cornered bargain on which the non-proliferation Treaty rests: nuclear Powers undertake to negotiate towards mutual nuclear disarmament; non-nuclear Powers forswear nuclear weapons and accept safeguards on their nuclear industries; and countries in a position to do so undertake to co-operate in the peaceful development of nuclear energy. These interlocking undertakings have not only a legal aspect deriving from the Treaty but political and psychological ramifications of the greatest importance. Indeed it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of the psychological dimensions of this whole problem. The substitution of confidence for hesitation, trust for suspicion, and hope for fatalism is essential for its solution.
39.	The interest of the international community is that all States should adhere to the non-proliferation Treaty. The fact that a large majority of States are now parties to the Treaty lends hope that universal adherence can be achieved. There is no other convincing test of a country's commitment to non-proliferation. Every nation has responsibilities to joining efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and to contribute to an international climate which would make it harder for States to remain outside the non-proliferation Treaty.
40.	Australia has always attached great importance to the cessation of nuclear testing in all environments. We are encouraged by the discussions which are taking place between the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on a comprehensive test-ban agreement. Such an agreement would be a major step forward in nuclear arms control. It would be an important barrier both to the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries and to the expansion of existing nuclear arsenals-and both are equally important. Agreement between the superpowers is the essential first step towards the cessation of tests by all countries in all environments.
41.	The pre-eminence of the super-Powers is also such that agreement between them must provide the foundation for progress, not merely towards mutual limitation but also towards the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament. In this context the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union are of fundamental importance. We welcome the significant measure of progress which the two States have already achieved and their commitment to continuing negotiations into the future.
42.	It goes without saying that the success of arms control efforts in the nuclear sphere is closely linked to satisfactory international controls on the utilization of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. Australia recognizes the right of all States to share in the utilization .of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. We believe that there should be the widest possible agreement on an appropriate framework for the management and operation of the nuclear fuel cycle. This requires stringent safeguards and controls on nuclear materials, equipment and technology to prevent their misuse for military purposes But alongside these, and of equal importance, there must be incentives for countries that, have unreservedly forsworn the nuclear weapons option. Such a framework will strengthen the non-proliferation regime. In this regard, Australia strongly supports the impending international nuclear fuel cycle evaluation.
43.	It is of course the most striking historical irony of our era that the nuclear energy which has given rise to the problem of proliferation also offers the only economic solution to another urgent problem facing the international community over the next few decades, namely, the prospect of energy shortages.
44.	No other issue so strikingly reflects the interdependence of the nations of our planet, for it affects all countries. None demonstrates so clearly the need for intensified co-operation to avoid what could be potentially disastrous consequences, politically, economically and socially, if the world proves incapable of a smooth and rapid adjustment from a primarily oil-based economy to one reliant on renewable and non-depletable sources of energy. We do not underestimate the difficulty of bringing about such a change, which will require considerable effort and many sacrifices on the part of all nations and will test our innovative skills to the utmost. Such a change will also-and I stress this-require a sustained and imaginative effort on the part of Governments to impress the gravity of the situation on the consciousness of their people, to make them fully aware of what is at risk if a solution is not found. But I am optimistic that, provided we co-operate closely, we shall succeed in overcoming the energy problems that face us.
45.	It is possible that by the mid-1980s, and virtually certain by the 1990s, there will be dislocations in the world's supply of oil as global oil resources become more rapidly depleted. The major oil-producing and oil-consuming countries are fully aware of this situation and will increasingly want to reserve oil supplies for non-substitutable energy and non-energy uses. In the light of this, Governments will be required to take urgent action to conserve energy use, to promote the development of conventional sources of energy and to develop, through intensified research and development programmes, alternative non-conventional energy sources which are both renewable and non-depletable. These are actions that cannot be put off until next year or the next decade. Given the long lead times involved and the prospect of energy shortages, action must be taken by Governments now. Many Governments, including my own, have recognized these realities and are responding accordingly.
46.	Last month the Australian Government announced a range of policies designed to promote the development of Australia's energy resources. Our decision to proceed with the mining and export of Australia's uranium will have important implications for the world community. Bearing in mind that we possess some 20 per cent of the Western world's proven low-cost reserves and have no domestic nuclear power requirement at this stage, Australia will be in a position to make a significant contribution towards supplying the needs of an increasingly energy-deficient world. Given that the scope for conservation and for expanding conventional energy sources is limited, and that alternative renewable energy sources are unlikely to be brought into commercial use in the short or medium term, an expansion in the use of nuclear power will be essential for the next few decades at least. Recognizing its responsibility to the international community, Australia is prepared to co-operate with other nations to supply uranium, subject to the strictest safeguard conditions, to facilitate this transition.
47.	Furthermore, we believe that, in order to overcome the obstacles facing the world community during the transition period in energy, co-operation among nations in this area must be intensified. Bilateral co-operation will be necessary but, in my view, insufficient; With the conclusion of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, no forum currently exists for continuing an international dialogue on energy. The Australian Government earnestly hopes that the failure to reach agreement on a continuation of the energy dialogue at the Conference will prove only temporary. We should spare no effort over the coming months to seek means of establishing international consultations on energy. As a potentially major net exporter of energy, Australia is ready to play its full part in any such future dialogue.
48.	When we talk of international interdependence, we are talking not only of the interdependence of countries, but also of issues. For these do not stand apart from each other as discrete problems but are interlocked. I have just mentioned the Conference on International Economic Co-operation in the context of energy; but both the Conference and the energy problem itself are of central importance to the next issue I wish to discuss: the North-South dialogue.
49.	That dialogue is about many things and at the deepest level. Economic matters are not the only important ones. But they certainly are important, and so far the dialogue has concentrated most heavily on them.
50.	The economies of many countries are heavily dependent on the income derived from exports of agricultural commodities and raw materials, and market forces cause significant fluctuations in the prices of these products. Little wonder, then, that these countries have sought to introduce measures of price stabilization, which would be to the benefit not only of producers but also of consumers.
51.	My country is a member of all existing international commodity agreements, many of which have brought together consumers and producers in a natural compact. Some of these agreements have been successful and the problems of others have encouraged the devising of alternative methods of ironing out excessive price fluctuations. Developing countries, concerned over worsening balance of payments positions, have made concerted efforts in UNCTAD for the adoption of measures which would assist in stabilizing prices over a wide range of commodities. In this context, a significant proposal now before the international community is that for an Integrated Programme of Commodities with the associated proposal for the establishment of a common fund.
52.	The decision in favour of the establishment of a common fund is perhaps the most notable achievement of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation, and I am pleased to have played some part in its adoption at the Ministerial Meeting in Paris in May and June. Subsequently, at the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in London from 8 to 15 June, the Australian Prime Minister urged the creation of a technical working group of experts to examine the matter. The Commonwealth Group, drawn from a cross-section of producer and consumer countries, developed and developing, was requested to report on the issues and considerations. My Government is examining their report, which has just been received, for the contribution it can make to the development of our position on the complex and technical questions associated with defining the common fund's purposes and methods of operation.
53.	Negotiations on an Integrated Programme for Commodities are proceeding concurrently with negotiations on tariff and non-tariff barriers affecting trade in a wide range of agricultural and industrial products. My Government welcomes the impetus given to the multilateral trade negotiations. We-are preparing our position in accordance with the time-table agreed upon between the United States and the European Community. We share, too, the concern expressed in London by the major economic partners of the Western world about the dangers of a resort to protectionism. The salutary lesson of the 1930s is clear; so also is that of the 1950s and the 1960s when economic prosperity moved hand-in-hand with an expansion in world trade. We look forward to the acceleration of the multilateral trade negotiations in the hope that the Tokyo round will indeed stimulate increased trade in farm products, raw materials and industrial goods.
54.	The Tokyo round is coming to its period of most intensive work at a time when there is growing recognition of the emergence of a significant number of middle-income countries, many of which possess growing industrial sectors and whose concerns to expand overseas markets are understood by my Government. Some of these countries are our neighbours. Some of their products pose special difficulties for sectors of the Australian community. An expansion of world trade would go a long way towards maintaining the very impressive pace of development they have achieved.
55.	Progress towards a new international economic order will be influenced also by the transfer of real resources to developing countries. Much of the development debate has hitherto focused on the aggregate levels of such resources. But it is not simply a matter of increasing the volume of aid. The quality of aid, particularly its relevance to the needs and priorities of the recipient countries themselves, is at least as important as quantity. In both these respects, 1 believe Australia's record is a good one: 425 million Australian dollars have been allocated to official development assistance for 1977/1978, an increase of 12 per cent. In United States dollar terms, the programme is approaching the half billion dollar mark. Virtually all of this assistance is in grant form. Our contribution to multilateral agencies will increase by 47 per cent in this financial year, reflecting the confidence we have in the major United Nations agencies, particularly UNDP. We have made significant further progress in untying aid for bilateral projects; over-all Australian bilateral aid is already substantially untied. My Government has undertaken multiyear commitments covering the major portion of our bilateral programme, as well as several multilateral organizations. Important new initiatives in regard to the funding of local costs of projects have also been undertaken. As a major food supplier, Australia is fully aware of the global concern to meet basic food requirements and to improve food security. Australia has recently announced several important new measures relating to food aid, including a substantial increase in food aid assistance and a commitment to contribute to an international reserve for emergencies.
56.	My delegation had hoped that it would prove possible for the General Assembly to reach agreement on the assessment of the outcome of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation. The Conference was a most important event, and Australians applauded the framework it provided for the concurrent examination of an enormous range of issues. Many of these issues were, and are, complex and not easily solved. The greatest achievement of the Conference lies in the exposure of these complexities, the greater understanding which I believe all participants derived in consequence, and the ere; ion of an atmosphere conducive to future dialogue. The concrete results of the Conference have fallen short of the expectations of many, but results there were. We recognize them for what they are, another step along the path towards equity, justice and rationality in international economic relations.
57.	I have spoken of the North-South dialogue in terms of the global economic issues and discussions which are most familiar to us and which capture most of the headlines, but I believe it is important that we not lose sight of the progress which is being made at other levels, in less dramatic gatherings. That progress is a reminder that not everything must wait on the solution of the big problems. As an example of what I have in mind, I draw the Assembly's attention to a development of great importance at the recent meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Port Moresby in regard to law of the sea and fishing matters. The independent and self-governing island Governments of the region decided at Port Moresby to co-operate closely with each other on the declaration of the 200-mile fisheries or exclusive economic zones and to establish a regional fisheries agency to enable them to secure the maximum benefits from the living resources of such zones. Australia warmly welcomes these developments and is co-operating with other countries in the region in securing agreements which will help to realize the important potential to be derived from maritime resources.
58.	If any one thing has characterized international affairs in the last year, it has been the unprecedented and very significant attention given to the question of human rights. This has not developed suddenly and unannounced. It is a response to forces which have been at work over a period of years. Among these are: the articulate demand in Western societies over the last 10 years for a foreign policy which specifically reflects democratic and liberal values; the third world's stress on human rights in its fight against apartheid, and its demand for a new international economic order; and the sustained, eloquent and courageous effort by oppressed people in many countries to draw the world's attention to their plight. Together these seem to indicate the likelihood of a trend towards a greater stress on the moral dimensions of international politics in general, and human rights in particular.
59.	Australia takes its human rights seriously. Our election to the Commission on Human Rights in May of this year gives an additional reason for doing so. The question of human rights is too important a matter to be dealt with in terms of rhetoric and gesture, too important to be subordinated to political manoeuvre or made a matter of public relations. It is related in the most direct way to questions of human suffering, human dignity and freedom. If we cannot take it seriously, we would do better to stop talking about it at all.
60.	There are very difficult problems to be worked out. The problem of selectivity on the part of Governments-or, for that matter, of Special interest groups-in expressing concern about human rights is one of them. Such selectivity is not necessarily evidence of cynicism, though it is often advanced as such. Given that Governments have a multiplicity of responsibilities, it is inevitable and proper that their commitment to human rights should be balanced against other valid commitments. These commitments include not only a concern for the national interest but, in the case of the great majority of Governments, the promotion of international peace and order. The tension between the promotion of human rights and the maintenance of detente between the super-Powers, for example, is not an artificial trumped-up thing; it really exists, and it does present hard choices. Such choices involve not merely the weighing of human rights considerations against those of 'realism', though that is often unavoidable; sometimes they involve weighing human rights against other goals- such as peace, international order, national cohesion-which also represent moral values, and sometimes these other goals will prevail. The fact that they do is evidence, not of cynicism or hypocrisy, but of the essential nature of moral choice.
61.	The problem of the different meanings and priorities given to human rights in different cultural, social and political contexts is an extremely important one. Given our geographic position, we in Australia have a pretty lively sense of this. What, for instance, is the proper relationship of civil and political rights to economic and social rights? Is it the case that economic rights are in some sense more fundamental than political rights, as some Governments maintain, or is the relationship more variable, ambiguous and complex than that? There is evidence, both in the form of behaviour at elections and in the form of political protest movements, which suggests that people are not indifferent to political rights, even when they lack economic rights.
62.	Again, what is the relationship between individual rights, which are the ones classically stressed in Western thinking, and collective and group rights, often stressed by the third world?
63.	And again, how should the existence of real internal threats to civil order and peace within a country influence our expectations concerning respect for human rights? Should we expect the same standards of behaviour from a Government under the pressure of such threats as we expect from a Government having the good fortune to enjoy an essentially peaceful and orderly domestic situation? Is there a legitimate distinction to be made between Governments whose problems are largely of their own making and ones which have inherited deep-set structural and cultural problems?
64.	All these are extraordinarily difficult questions. They are made more difficult by the fact that sometimes good arguments are misused and misapplied. But if the concern for human rights is going to find expression in practical, effective terms, and not be relegated to the sphere of Utopian aspirations, they are questions which demand our attention.
65.	No situation in the world more forcefully illustrates the importance of the issue of human rights than does that in southern Africa, where the systematic neglect and the violation of those rights have created an explosive state of affairs. Australia's attitude to the imperative issues of human rights which still remain to be resolved in southern Africa was forcefully expressed by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Malcolm Fraser, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London in June.
66.	More recently, I had occasion as leader of the Australian delegation at the World Conference for Action against Apartheid -to make very clear our stand on that issue, and to survey the practical measures we have undertaken in respect of it. At Lagos, as earlier at Maputo. there was an impressive degree of consensus on the problems-and on the consequences of not resolving them.
67.	It is heartening that important initiatives have been launched to find peaceful negotiated settlements in Rhodesia and Namibia. The Anglo-American proposals for
Zimbabwe have provided a foundation for a peaceful settlement in keeping with the demand for majority rule and independence. The world, and the Zimbabwean parties to the dispute, will have cause for congratulation if the opportunity is seized and reason and generosity prevail.
68.	Again in relation to Namibia, we see a significant initiative in train. And again this initiative draws its strength from the persistence of the international community in its demand that the Territory should achieve independence through free elections under the supervision of the United Nations. Australia, in the United Nations Council for Namibia and elsewhere, has worked for this goal and commends the current effort for its achievements.
69.	There appears to have been a significant shift in the policies of the South African Government toward Namibia. This shift is very late, and it is in response to international pressure, but it does offer a glimmer of hope that the path of dialogue is not completely closed.
70.	With southern Africa, the Middle East situation remains the major danger to international peace. In fact, in our view, it constitutes the single most dangerous and volatile point of potential conflict in world politics. As any further outbreak of war in the region would almost certainly eclipse previous ones in terms of destructiveness, and as it must also be considered doubtful whether it could be contained, the resolution of the conflict is of concern to all Members.
71.	I take this opportunity to place on the record once again the Australian Government's recognition of the need for early settlement between Israel and the Arab States. The Australian Government continues to consider that the general principles on which a settlement should be based are those set out in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973). Any settlement will also have to take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The efforts which President Carter's administration has made, and is continuing to make, to foster negotiations between the parties are greatly appreciated by the Australian Government, [n the context of the important need to maintain this momentum we should much regret the intrusion of potentially disruptive elements into the negotiating process.
72.	In coming to terms with all the critical international problems which confront us, it is as important to give thought to finding appropriate and effective means as it is to give thought to the ends to be sought. It is with this well in mind that the Australian Government has been active during the past year in promoting an infinitive on review of the multilateral treaty-making process, The multinational treaty is an important—if not the most important—instrument of adjustment in the international community It evidences the corning together of our sovereign wills in a precise and focused manner.
73.	However, vital though multilateral treaties are in the life of this Organization, we have never collectively addressed ourselves to the question: What is the best way in
which to go about making such treaties? We must satisfy ourselves that we are using the most efficient methods to convert our ideas for co-operation and improvement into clear and acceptable treaty language. The process of gestation of a multilateral treaty is both sensitive and complex. We must ensure that it makes the least possible demands upon our administrative and financial resources. The human skills which are involved in the conferences, committees and working parties and other meetings which eventually lead to a treaty text are also badly needed to perform other services.
74.	Our aim, therefore, is to invite the United Nations to direct its attention to these important procedural matters. If the system can be improved, let us improve it. If it cannot be improved, let us at last have the satisfaction of knowing that the present methods are as perfect as deliberate consideration can make them.
75.	We have consulted widely before introducing item 124 in the agenda. The positive terms of the responses which we have had from other States have been very gratifying. In all quarters, in all regional groups, the prospective utility of this item has been acknowledged as evidenced in part by the number and range of States which have joined us in sponsoring it. As the first stage in an assessment which must be spread over several sessions, we now look forward to a serious and constructive debate in the Sixth Committee.
76.	While we hope for success in this and in other possible efforts to improve the working tools at our disposal, we must at the same time continue to confront the many serious problems which face us in this increasingly complex and interdependent world. I have discussed what my Government believes are the most pressing and significant of these problems. There are two observations that can be made about all of them. The first is that, so far as solving them is concerned, time is a wasting asset. Delay, waiting on events, will only magnify the problems. Indeed, in some cases delay must lead to disaster. If we are to act effectively, we must act quickly. My second observation is that the solution of these problems will depend crucially on the mustering of the necessary political will. Difficult and complex as these problems are, they will become insoluble only if we decide to treat them as such. Someone has made the acute observation that decadence begins when people can no longer ask, 'What are we going to do? but rather 'What is going to happen to us?' when, that is, will surrenders to events, and resignation and fatalism take over.
77.	They must not be allowed to take over. Our fate will not be determined by some inexorable historical laws nor by objective circumstances. It will be determined by the way we respond to the challenges which confront us; it is in our own hands.
 

"
5883,36,1981,PNG,"
At the outset my delegation joins, previous speakers in extending to the President our congratulations on his election to the presidency of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly. With his vast experience and diplomatic skills he will ably lead us throughout his term. I should also like to extend our profound gratitude to his predecessor for the skillful and excellent manner in which he conducted the business of the last session.
157.	On 15 September the General Assembly witnessed a momentous occasion, which marked the admission of the Republic of Vanuatu to the United Nations. It was a historic ind joyous occasion, especially for those of us from the South Pacific. With great pride and pleasure, Papua New Guinea welcomes Vanuatu as the one hundred and fifty-fifth Member of the United Nations. Its joining this body is significant, because it adds to the small but growing community of South Pacific countries in the United Nations. We sincerely hope that Vanuatu will not be the last, and look forward to more of our neighbors in the South Pacific joining us.
158.	On behalf of my Government, I should also like to extend our warm congratulations' to Mr. Walter Lini, Prime Minister of Vanuatu, and his people on their achievement. It is to their credit that through their skill and dedication Vanuatu was able to withstand some trying times at independence and establish a strong and stable Government. Vanuatu has been independent for just over 12 months. During that period it has taken giant steps in nation-building and has become a strong voice in regional affairs. We wish Vanuatu all success and look forward to working closely with its Government on many global issues, both in this forum and elsewhere.
159.	The pursuit of international peace and security is the most fundamental task of the United Nations. When peace is threatened, all other development initiatives of this body temporarily cease tc be important. Peace and harmony among nations is the greatest catalyst for developing an equitable international community, where any nation, no matter how large or small, how impoverished or wealthy, can fruitfully seek to improve the lives of its people.
160.	Today we are witnessing a destabilization of international security brought about by territorial greed and ideological ambition. The haves are taking from the have nots. Whole countries are being swallowed up. Tension grows between the superPowers, bringing the world closer to the brink of nuclear confrontation. These tensions have affected and will continue to affect the majority of the world's population, the innocent bystanders, who have not contributed, and may not contribute, to these rivalries.
161.	Faced with this prospect, we think it timely and indeed necessary to appeal to the superPowers and those nations with a nuclear strike capability to weigh again the enormous responsibility that they carry for world peace.
162.	Disarmament, as a realistic avenue to peace, does not seem to have achieved any positive results. As of today there has been no meaningful reduction in the manufacture, stockpiling and strategic positioning of intercontinental nuclear weapons.
■ .9
163.	The arms race, rather than being reversed or slowed, is escalating to new peaks of sophistication and destructive force, in both its conventional and nucbar aspects. Added to this already alarming situation is the production and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. Recent press reports indicating the use of toxic chemical weapons in SouthEast Asia and Afghanistan are even more alarming. The use of such weapons is a flagrant violation of relevant international conventions prohibiting theg use.
164.	My delegation is dismayed by these developments and believes that there must be a point at which reason triumphs over suspicion where a common threat to mankind is honestly acknowledged and nations of influence resolve to redress this position with single-minded purpose.
165.	In this respect, we urge the United States and the Soviet Union to approach future Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with a greater determination to achieve tangible gains for mankind. As two of the most powerful nations, they have a correspondingly sizable obligation to ensure that peace and global stability are not compromised for purely strategic gains.
166.	My delegation wishes also to draw attention once again to the enormous annual global expenditures on arms and defense. As a third world country facing a difficult economic decade, Papua New Guinea sympathizes with the least developed countries which have yet to overcome the far more basic problems of feeding and providing adequate health care for their people.
167.	My delegation believes it is time that defense and the nuclear arms race were looked at in a proper humanitarian perspective. While nations arm in the name of providing a deterrent to conflict so that lives may be saved, malnutrition, disease, floods and famine are claiming millions of lives that could otherwise have been saved with a little more humanitarian concern by the wealthy nations.
168.	It is Papua New Guinea's intention to accede to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [General Assembly resolution 2373 (XXII), annex]. We believe that efforts to curb the threat of nuclear warfare can be achieved by increasing collectively the desire of States Members of the United Nations which are concerned with the blatant misuse of nuclear technology.
169.	One aspect of this abuse of technology which is of great concern to Papua New Guinea and other Pacific States is the continued testing of nuclear weapons in our region and proposals by other States to conduct experimental dumping of nuclear waste in our waters. I specifically refer here to France's testing of nuclear weapons at Moruroa Atoll and the intention of the United States and Japan to dump nuclear waste.
170.	By their own admission these countries have said that these tests are experimental. The aftereffects are not known and nobody can say with certainty what the long term effects will be on our peaceful region. Papua New Guinea is distressed by these developments and wishes to make clear that the actions of France and the stated intentions of the United States and Japan are morally wrong and a breach of accepted international conduct,
171.	I repeat Papua New Guinea's position that, if these nations wish to conduct dangerous tests, they should do so within their own territorial areas. The Pacific Island States will not continue to tolerate abuses of this sort. Our peoples have a far greater affinity with the land and sea than peoples of the industrialized nations. To jeopardize these assets, which are the sources of our livelihood, can lead only to a straining of relations and rising antagonism.
172.	I should now like to turn to the issue of decolonization and to reiterate Papua New Guinea's strong support for the principles of free determination of all peoples. We believe that colonialism is a thing of the past and that the remaining NonSelfGoverning Territories should be granted their inalienable right to chart their own destiny, as stated in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). In this respect we wish to draw, the Assembly's attention to the position adopted by the Twelfth South Pacific Forum, meeting in Vanuatu last month, which reaffirmed our belief in the principles of self-determination and independence applying to non-self-governing Pacific island countries, including the French territories. Further, the South Pacific Forum decided to consult with the French President on the evolution of the new French Government's policy with respect to progress towards decolonization of the people of the French Pacific territories.
173.	Papua New Guinea is particularly worried by the possible ramifications should France decide not to create a climate that will ensure that the people of New Caledonia are given the right to choose their own destiny. We sense that a continuation of the status quo will exacerbate the growing frustration and tension of the ethnic Melane sian population which could lead to instability, not only in New Caledonia itself but throughout the South Pacific region.
174.	Papua New Guinea will also continue to support decolonization in other parts of the world.
175.	The situation in Namibia continues to cause grave concern to my country. Even though we are far from the shores of Africa, we wholeheartedly support the movement in Namibia to free that Territory from the yoke of colonization by the racist regime in Pretoria. The Government of South Africa has no legitimate or even moral right to be in Namibia. The International Court of Justice has said so, as has the world community, which continues to say so. The South African Government also continues to ignore the people of Namibia as they cry out for freedom. The Organization has proposed peaceful means to resolve this dilemma in the form of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Even though the South African regime was amenable to that resolution and seemed to have been prepared to accept it, it suddenly made an about face early this year. We question the true intentions and motives of the South African Government. Are they sincere or are they merely playing games? They fooled the United Nations and even the contact group. Despite the reversal of the South African position, some Members tell us to exercise moderation in order to entice South Africa back to its 1978 position.
176.	While we procrastinate, the people of Namibia continue to suffer. How long should such suffering be tolerated? We on the outside cannot, in reality, measure the pain that is being borne by the people of Namibia, a burden that should be removed quickly. There was hope early this year, but that has almost disappeared. In fact, South Africa's recent attitudes and actions seem to us to have jeopardized the last vestige of hope for an early peaceful settlement of the Namibia question. The world must act to assist the people of Namibia in achieving their independence. In fact, this Assembly has acted and continues to do so. The people of Namibia should not lose heart, since an overwhelming majority of the world continues to give them moral support. This is evidenced by the adoption of resolution ES8/2 on 14 September 1981 by the General Assembly. It was supported by 117 Members, including Papua New Guinea; while 25 abstained, no one voted against it. Even though there were some elements which may have caused us to make some reservations in our position, we deliberately refrained from doing so. The situation in Namibia, in our view, has gone beyond the necessity for adhering to our reservations as they apply specifically to Namibia. We now regard Namibia as a special and unique case because of the present unnecessary prolongation of a peaceful settlement.
177.	The continuing conflict in the Middle East has had a profound effect on the international community, and although we are geographically remote from that region we acknowledge the principle of interdependence of nations and support all initiatives to bring about a lasting and equitable solution.
178.	We commend the United Nations for its efforts in attempting to resolve that conflict and urge that those efforts be redoubled as a matter of urgency. It is my delegation's view that the United Nations can play a constructive role and successfully mediate in bringing about a solution. However, we note with grave concern that efforts by the United Nations are threatened by the increasing sale of arms to Middle East States involved in the conflict. We believe that continued arms sales can only prolong the crisis and cause further division between the parties in conflict.
179.	Efforts such as the Camp David agreements which aim to provide a basis for comprehensive and lasting settlement receive Papua New Guinea's support. We are mindful of other efforts towards peace in the region, and they too receive our endorsement.
180.	I mentioned earlier Papua New Guinea's total and unqualified opposition to manipulation and interference in the affairs of small, underdeveloped States by nations possessing superior military and economic resources.
181: The most blatant examples of unprovoked aggression have occurred in Afghanistan and Kampuchea, where puppet Governments supported by foreign military forces have been installed. Papua New Guinea does riot recognize either Government. We believe that the situation in Afghanistan cannot be normalized while Soviet troops continue to occupy parts of that country.
182.	In this regard, Papua New Guinea supports the efforts of the European Council to convene an international conference aimed at bringing all parties to the conflict together for negotiations. We also support initiatives to arrange talks between Afghanistan and neighboring States.
183.	We note that the Soviet Union has not responded to a United Nations resolution calling for the immediate, unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. The Soviet Union's act of unprovoked aggression and its arrogant disregard of world opinion constitute a serious violation of international law and pose a marked threat to world peace and stability.
184.	Similarly, Papua New Guinea continues to deplore the intervention of foreign forces in Kampuchea and will maintain its position of not recognizing Heng Samrin regime installed by the Vietnamese.
185.	We commend the efforts of the SecretaryGeneral, under General Assembly resolution 35/6, in hosting the recent International Conference on Kampuchea in July this year and we support the Declaration of that Conference.13 My delegation believes that that Declaration embodies the prerequisites for a negotiated settlement in Kampuchea.
186.	I should also like to commend recent efforts by the members of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEAN] to unite the Khmer factions in their struggle to liberate Kampuchea from Viet Nam. The recent meeting of the three main Khmer factions in Singapore was significant. The Joint Statement issued as a result of that meeting [see A/361498] demonstrates the continuing desire and willingness of the Kampucitean people jointly to work towards liberating their homeland from foreign aggression.
187.	Papua New Guinea also wishes to reiterate its view that a meaningful and lasting solution in Kampuchea can only be achieved through the total cooperation of Viet Nam, and we strongly urge Viet Nam to adhere to the wishes of the international community as contained in resolution 35/6 and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea.
188.	In the recent past the international community has realized that the economic welfare of each sovereign nation depends on a network of interdependence. At the same time it has noted that there is a widening gap between developed and developing countries on many economic issues. The new international economic order, when it was mooted in 1974 [see General Assembly resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 (SVI)], was intended to find ways and means to rectify the imbalance in economic conditions. The Government of Papua New Guinea is concerned that the progress being made in achieving the objective of a new international economic order has so far been slow.
189.	The efforts that have been made at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to bring about an equitable international economic order or changes in the existing world economic system have my delegation's support.
190.	Papua New Guinea is appreciative of the progress being made through UNCTAD in achieving the objectives of. an integrated Program for commodities, particularly the arrangements on. the Common Fund for Commodities and individual international commodities.
191.	My delegation supports efforts by the international community to bring about a new structure to regulate trade ii? primary commodities with a view to achieving price levels which are remunerative for producers and equitable for consumers.
192.	The Lome Convention has assisted Papua New Guinea greatly in areas such as access to funds and technical expertise from the European Community countries to help implement development projects. Although Papua New Guinea's major export commodities have duty-free access to the markets of the European Community, my delegation has ''noted that the original purpose of the Lome arrangement to secure more balanced and fairer trade has yet to be achieved.
193.	We note with interest the set of concrete recommendations for a Program of action in several key areas of restructuring the international economy contained in the Brandt Commission report.14 The report is complementary to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Pearson report is sponsored by the World Bank. The significance of the Brandt report is based on the emphasis it places on mutuality of interest. The report is consistent with the decisions of the fourth session of UNCTAD and the new international economic order in that it calls for the restructuring of the international economic system so as to ensure a greater flow of benefits to developing countries. In addition, the report emphasizes the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers, which Papua New Guinea believes is a prerequisite for improving terms of trade for both developed and develop^ ing countries.
194.	As a developing country, Papua New Guinea supports the recommendations of the Brandt Commission report, in particular those covering trade and development finance.
195.	We note that most codes or agreements on non tariff measures that have been concluded are now in force, yet some developed countries have not applied them. Despite the marked^ achievements in multilateral trade negotiations, developing countries continue to face undue restrictions in developed market economies.
196.	My delegation notes with dismay that in international economic relations increasing protectionist tendencies are shown by developed countries. Most industrialized countries maintain comparatively low average tariff levels, yet some individual tariffs remain high, especially for products of export interest to developing countries. Papua New Guinea opposes protectionism and supports the efforts made in multilateral trade negotiations to achieve freer world trade.
197.	My delegation would like, to see the implementation of the various plans of action proposed by the United Nations and its agencies. The Lima Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Cooperation and related new international economic order proposals for a substantial acceleration in the industrialization of the developing countries clearly imply major structural shifts in the patterns of world production and trade in manufactured goods. In particular, a rapid increase in industrial capacity and in the availability of manufactured goods for export from developing countries would requite a restructuring of the industrial sector of developed countries to accommodate a large expansion in imports from developing countries.
198.	Although Papua New Guinea does not have a large manufacturing sector, we support the Lima Plan of Action and hope that in implementing that Plan the rural needs and aspirations of the developing countries will be given due consideration.
199.	Papua New Guinea also supports the principle of economic cooperation among developing countries. We have become a member of various regional groupings and of a selected number of United Nations specialized agencies in an attempt to achieve our aims.
200.	It should be remembered that the slow progress in achieving the aims of economic cooperation among developing countries has been the direct or indirect result of the negative attitude shown by industrialized nations. For example, during the 1970s and early 1960s the issue of decolonization was the major concern of the emerging States. Political currents at the time had induced third world countries to adopt positions of confrontation towards industrialized nations. As a result very little or no effort was directed towards meaningful cooperation in the fields of economic and social development. In this connection my delegation believes that a positive attitude by developed and developing countries in playing their part in development issues will pave the way to achievement of the aims of a new international economic order.
201.	I should now like to make a brief reference to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which has been meeting since 1974. The objective of the Conference is to produce a universally accepted convention that will govern the uses of the sea and its resources.
202.	However, we are disappointed that the Conference was not able to implement the Program of work which it adopted during the second half of the ninth session at Geneva in August last year and which called for the conclusion of the Conference and adoption of a convention during the tenth session in MarchApril 1981. The delay in the conclusion of the work of the Conference and the adoption of a convention has been caused by the United States Government's desire to review certain provisions of the draft convention. It is my delegation's hope that the United States Government's review will not call for renegotiations on provisions that have already been agreed upon by the Conference. To do so would jeopardize the results achieved so far through the painstaking negotiations over the past decade and prevent the early adoption of a convention on the law of the sea. My delegation therefore supports the early conclusion and adoption of a convention on the law of the sea by the end of the eleventh session, which is to be held in New York during MarchApril 1982., The convention should be open for signature in Caracas in the autumn of the same year.
203.	I have touched upon only some of the issues that beset the world today. These problems, in my Government's view, are serious. They must be solved. It is our duty to solve them. No other people will do that for us. But to do so, we must be practical and realistic. We must cooperate with each other to the fullest extent. If we do not, these problems will increase to the point where it will be too late to find solutions to them.


"
5899,36,1981,AUS,"I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the thirty-sixth session of the General Assembly.This session takes place at an important moment in international affairs. I believe you will ensure that it achieves significant and lasting results. I also join in the tributes to the contribution of the outgoing President, Mr. von Wechmar of the Federal Republic of Germany, to the work of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
216.	I should also like to join other speakers in welcoming Vanuatu, a Pacific partner and fellow Commonwealth member, as a Member of this Organization. I had the good fortune to pay a visit to Vila in August, when Vanuatu hosted the South Pacific Forum.
217.	Australia's relationships with its Pacific neighbors continue to expand. So too do our relationships with other neighboring countries in South and SouthEast Asia. Indeed, Australia is perhaps unique among the developed countries, being in a region otherwise populated by countries in and of the third world which brings me to the main theme of this statement, the NorthSouth dialog.
218.	I am aware, of course, of the vast range of issues before this Assembly, many of which demand our immediate and earnest consideration. In the coming weeks our delegation will be making Australia's attitude on these issues known. However, today I will concentrate on the NorthSouth dialog. We have reached an. important stage in relations between developed and developing countries and we must be prepared to make genuine progress.
219.	Australia would welcome progress. We do not seek change simply for its own sake. Our belief in the need for change stems from our conviction that new attitudes and new arrangements and, above all, a new commitment are needed to tackle the most fundamental problems of the present international economic system. We believe that merely preserving the status quo is not enough and that all nations will gain from a growing and more integrated world economy.
220.	Over the last seven years a number of significant declarations have been made under the auspices of the United Nations. Many of these resolutions are landmarks in the search for a new basis for international cooperation. Unfortunately, we have so far found it very difficult to put the spirit of them into practice. Rhetoric, conflict and division have characterized debate over NorthSouth issues. Nevertheless, there have been some encouraging developments notably the agreement to set up the Common Rind for Commodities and the creation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The need to manage the growing interdependence of States demands that we do much more.
221.	If the NorthSouth dialog is managed effectively and in a spirit of cooperation and compromise the international economic system will be able to make necessary and equitable adjustments. We can avoid serious disruptions, which would be damaging for developed and developing countries alike.
222.	To do that we need to understand the consequences of greater interdependence. Recognition of interdependence is essential, not only for prosperity, but also for longterm peace and security. Nations cannot put up the shutters and attempt to live in self-imposed isolation. We must respond not only to the demands of our own national communities but to those of the world as a whole.
223.	In approaching the NorthSouth dialog, we must concentrate on its essential elements. Over time, procedures and agreements will have to be devised which generate benefits for us all, not in equal measure perhaps, and certainly more for the most disadvantaged, but nevertheless benefits for us all.
224.	In Australia's view, genuine progress in North South questions will only be achieved if we acknowledge fully some of the realities of the international economy. We should recognize that the major industrialized countries of the North will be asked to carry the biggest share of the burden. Those economies generate the vast majority of the world's wealth and clearly, any setbacks they suffer will be felt far beyond their own borders. The fact is that the prospects for the peoples of the world's less developed nations hinge largely on the economic fortunes of those motor economies. In looking at how progress can be made in the NorthSouth dialog, we must not lose sight of the stake all nations have in a strong and dynamic international economic system.
225.	Australia's recent economic performance is in contrast to that of most of the other industrialized nations. We have made real progress in fighting some of the most intractable economic problems. I suggest it is worthwhile to examine how we have done it. In mentioning Australia's distinctive economic performance, I am aware that within the market economies different economic strategies will have to be used, as appropriate, to produce the results both North and South are looking for. Over the last decade Australia has used two strategies, with very different results.
226.	We initially looked to government to provide the solution to our economic problems, in the expectation that government could provide a comprehensive shelter from the harsh economic realities of the times. Rapid growth of government spending and relaxation of restraints on the money supply were translated directly into unacceptably high levels of inflation. The damage to employment and investment was immediate and severs.
227.	We subsequently chose the alternative of fighting inflation as a first priority, restricting government spending, cutting back government deficits and making careful use of monetary policy. That strategy has resulted in a significant reduction in inflation and unemployment, higher rates of growth and a greater inflow of the overseas capital so vital to the development of our national resources.
228.	But Australia recognizes that for progress to be made in the NorthSouth dialog industrialized nations must do more than simply use whatever strategies they see fit to put their own houses in order. Those nations, whose participation will be vital to the success of any global round of negotiations, must be persuaded that on balance their domestic and external interests can be pie served and indeed furthered. If we cannot do that we shall find, even though the negotiations may begin, that the process will constantly be placed in jeopardy because the expectations exceed the results that are politically possible or economically feasible. If the process of global negotiations is to be resumed in the most promising context we should all carefully review our demands and expectations, in terms not only of what can be achieved but also of the timescale which might be necessary. We must devise proposals and procedures which will enable all nations and groups to make the maximum contributions within the realistic limits of their politics and capabilities.
229.	In event, Governments alone cannot create the climate of international prosperity which will be necessary if we are to achieve the goals of the NorthSouth dialog. The potential contribution of the private sector must be recognized and it must be given the opportunity to participate. We are sure that the global negotiations process, conducted in a multilateral framework, will be able to provide a role for the private sector. Our approach to global negotiations must embrace all aspects of economic endeavor.
230.	The problems of a difficult world economic situation have not prevented the efforts of member countries to get NorthSouth cooperation moving again. Recent meetings in Caracas, Ottawa, Nairobi, Cancun and Paris have held out some prospect of progress.
231.	In a few days time there will be an opportunity to review the state of NorthSouth relations when the biennial meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government takes place in Australia. I am aware that nonCommonwealth Members of the General Assembly may not be fully aware of the role and function of the Commonwealth.
232.	The notion of the Commonwealth as a colonial relic has now been well and truly dispelled. The modem Commonwealth has been responsive to the needs and aspirations of its members. Moreover, it has made several important contributions to the international community, including arrangements for majority rule in Zimbabwe and support for establishment of the Common Bind.
233.	The Commonwealth has some distinct advantages as a forum for the consideration of NorthSouth issues. Over a quarter of the States represented here today are members of the Commonwealth. It includes major industrialized States, newly industrializing States, least developed countries, island developing States and oil-exporting developing States. Its frank and informal way of working has helped build consensus among its members,
234.	The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will be considering many of the subjects before this Assembly. It will take up the questions of decolonization and racism in Africa, particularly as they relate to Namibia and South Africa; the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea; arms control and disarmament; the Indian Ocean; human rights; and the law of the sea. Nevertheless, a principal focus of the meeting will be the present state of NorthSouth relations. Discussions with participating Heads of Government have indicated that special attention will be given to food and food security, trade and industrialization, international Financial questions and energy.
235.	Commonwealth leaders will have the opportunity to examine those matters at that meeting, which comes shortly before the NorthSouth summit meeting to be held in Mexico in October. They have indicated that they wish to do so, and I am confident that the results of that review will make a positive contribution to the work of nations attending the meeting in Cancun and to the work of this Assembly. 

236.	Seven Heads of Government who will be in Melbourne will go to Cancun. My Government hopes they will be able to carry a clear and unequivocal message from the whole membership of the Commonwealth that there should be new progress in NorthSouth relations and that at this session the General Assembly should resume efforts to achieve an effective framework for the global negotiations.
237.	I should now like to make some specific comments on the principal issues on the NorthSouth agenda.
238.	One of the most pressing problems facing the developing countries is food production and food security. Clearly, the only longterm solution lies in the developing countries increasing their own production, through increased investment in agriculture and the adoption of appropriate national food strategies.
239.	There is also a need for international measures which will assist world food security in both the short and long terms. Australia has consistently supported such measures. They include increased food grain aid commitments to meet the World Food Conference target of 10 million tonnes per year and a concerted effort to reach agreement on the replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. I also believe that a significant contribution could be made to world food security by the negotiation of an international grain agreement, with economic provisions which would safeguard the common interests of both exporting and importing countries while recognizing the special needs of developing countries.
240.	In recognition of the continuing need of developing countries, Australia recently announced a number of initiatives relating to food security. Those include an increase in food aid to over $US 120 million this financial year and the establishment of an Australian center for International Agricultural Research. The principal aim of the center will be to contribute to the solution of agricultural problems in developing countries. A trust fund will be established for the center with an initial commitment of $US 28 million over four years.
241.	The general situation in world trade is particularly difficult. Economic difficulties in the major world economies have gone hand in hand with mounting protectionist pressures. Some form of protection is now applied to almost 30 per cent of world trade.
242.	The developing countries are having an increasing impact on world trade. Their exports continue to increase more rapidly than the world average and they are the fastest growing importers of the products of the major industrialized countries.
243.	Increased opportunities for trade offer the most effective means to bring greater prosperity to the developing countries. However, the prospect of increased protectionism, when coupled with the significant deterioration in the terms of trade of non-oil developing countries as a group, means that the outlook of those countries is increasingly uncertain.
244.	Despite the achievements of the last global round, the multilateral trade negotiations still left the developing countries facing higher levels of protection than the industrialized countries. The position has continued to deteriorate, with the major industrialized countries introducing further protectionist measures. Moreover, the fact that many of these measures are not introduced through the conventional institutional framework means that the developing countries are unable to challenge their introduction or to seek redress where they are treated inequitably.
245.	There is another angle to all this. To the extent that both the North and the South stand to benefit from improved world economic conditions and higher levels of NorthSouth trade, it can be shown that the participants in NorthSouth dialog are not necessarily participants in a 'zero-sum game'. There does not have to be a winner and a loser. The gains from higher levels of trade are shared by both importer and exporter, by both North and South. That is an aspect which could be given more attention than it has in the past.
246.	There is an urgent need for international bodies to consider ways and means of better accommodating developing countries within the international trading system. Both the global negotiations, when they take place, and the forthcoming GATT meeting of trade ministers should address that issue.
247.	Important contributions can also be made in the field of commodities. Commodity trade is fundamental to the wellbeing of the developing countries and price stabilization alone will not provide the means to greater prosperity. There is only limited scope for the introduction of buffer stock finance schemes and these are not appropriate for all commodities. Other aspects of the UNCTAD Integrated Program for Commodities must be seriously, explored. In that context special attention should be given to the scope for increasing commodity processing within commodity-exporting countries.
248.	We are all aware of the severe problems of higher energy prices for non-oil producing developing countries. Although national Governments themselves must introduce energy policies aimed at encouraging conservation, conversion and development of new resources, the international community again can play an important part.
249.	The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held in Nairobi, was able to demonstrate that the United Nations could make a positive contribution to the discussion of energy matters. It also highlighted some of the special problems of developing countries, including the supply of the most ancient of energy sources fuel wood. The international community must address these critical problems, while not neglecting the needs of all countries for conventional fuels. Measures to implement the Program of Action adopted by the Conference must now be taken. For its part, Australia has agreed to support financial proposals from that Program.
250.	Australia supports the establishment of the proposed World Bank energy affiliate to develop new sources of oil supply and to promote the use of alternative energy sources. However, greater lending for those purposes should not be delayed until some new body is established. We therefore welcome the recent increase in energy lending by the World Bank.

251.	The debt situation for many countries now imposes a severe burden. High energy costs, inflation, steep in 
creases in interest rates and changing exchange rates have all had their impact. Debt management problems appear to be particularly harsh for those developing countries which are at the two extremes: those which are going through a process of dynamic growth face difficulties in financing that growth, while the low-income countries are having difficulty in paying for imports, particularly energy.
252.	Australia welcomes the response so far by IMF to these difficult problems which confront the developing countries. The IMF has shown flexibility in its approach and has made an important contribution to the recycling process. Australia supports soundly based improvements in the Fund which will benefit developing countries. The new enlarged access to the Fund's resources, the establishment of a food facility and an interest subsidy account are innovative and important developments.
253.	There remains a need for the Fund to continue to adapt its activities to changing circumstances. Australia would support increased IMF capacity to assist the financing and adjustment of large financial deficits and in that context welcomes the recently concluded borrowing agreements to assist in ensuring that adequate resources are made available to countries in balance of payments difficulties.
254.	Australia recognizes the importance of industrialization for the developing countries. Industrialization provides the main avenue for achieving rapid economic growth, improved employment opportunities and higher standards of living. Sound, practical economic measures, tailored to the resource endowments and capabilities of each country, are necessary. Recent years have seen progress in those areas, with contributions from UNIDO and the regional commissions and the development banks.
255.	Australia is also concerned with the related problems of protection and structural adjustment. These raise complex issues for all countries and Australia is no exception though on a per capita basis we are already a major importer of manufactured goods from developing countries. The Australian Government has recently commissioned an independent inquiry into our domestic tariff arrangements. The objective of that inquiry, which is to be completed within six months, is to identify possible measures for further general reductions in longterm protection levels.
256.	Official development assistance remains an important instrument for growth. It is particularly effective when provided in support of domestic efforts and policies designed to promote self-reliant development.
257.	Australia has recently increased its aid program substantially to just under three quarters of a billion United States dollars in the current Australian financial year. The increase planned for the present financial year of more than $US 110 million is evidence of our acceptance of official development assistance as a key element in the NorthSouth dialog. It will allow us to undertake various important new practical initiatives in the main areas of NorthSouth discussion, such as food, energy and international finance.
258.	The outcome of the recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries recently held in
Paris is a significant and positive step in relations between developed and developing nations. The action it has proposed will help to ease the problems of the poorer countries. Australia is one of the few donors actually located among developing nations and its aid priorities reflect its regional links and associations in the South Pacific and in north and south Asia. Australia has, however, more than doubled its assistance to the least developed countries over the period 1978 to 1981.
259.	In the coming year we shall be increasing our contributions to UNDP, UNFPA and UNICEF. Similar substantial increases are programmed in our contributions to UNHCR and UNRWA. Australia ranked ninth among the countries to announce contributions at the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa held earlier this year. Our food aid allocations are increasingly being directed to the famine and emergency situations which have arisen in Africa.
260.	Australia, with other developed countries, supported the principle of economic cooperation among developing countries at the fifth session of UNCTAD in 1979. We welcome the potential identified by the Caracas SouthSouth meeting last May for practical cooperation among developing countries in a wide range of economic areas. We are hopeful that SouthSouth cooperation will develop in a way which is complementary to the achievement of improved relations between North and South.
261.	I wish to refer also to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which is drafting a legal regime to cover the resources of the oceans. The international community has worked in close cooperation for almost a decade to finalize that new legal regime, which places great emphasis on equity and international resource sharing. It is my Government's sincere hope that next year a convention on the law of the sea, enjoying widespread support, may be opened for signature. I believe that would be a major demonstration of what may be achieved by cooperation between developed and developing countries.
262.	I have today focused attention on Australia's interests in the achievement of progress in the NorthSouth dialog. We must not lose the opportunity we have this year to make a historic contribution to progress in North South questions. Let us hope that the summit meeting of Heads of Government in Cancun and the Commonwealth meeting will be able to provide a new momentum and a new commitment to the progress towards an effective global dialog. Let us also recognize that a global round, to be effective, must allow for the participation of all interested countries. All Member States must be persuaded that their interests will be protected and that they will have the opportunity to contribute in a real way to the process of negotiation. The United Nations must have a major role in die process.
263.	The world community has only one universal body, the United Nations. The Organization has its limitations. It has its shortcomings. But we will have to work within its framework and capitalize on its possibilities if we are to achieve a fundamental and long-lasting reconciliation of the interests of developed and developing countries.


"
6002,36,1981,NZL,"Mr. VicePresident, will you please congratulate President Kittani on his election as President of this Assembly. His long and distinguished service to the international community makes him eminently qualified for that task, and I know that he will guide us with impartiality and skill.
42.	It is a great pleasure to welcome two fellow members of the Commonwealth, Belize and Vanuatu, to this assembly of nations. We are especially gratified that independence has brought one more into the growing family of South Pacific island nations. Their voices, individually and collectively, are going to be heard more and more in the world assembly. The addition to our membership of two more small nations, proud of their independence but limited in resources, brings home to us one of the major issues facing this Assembly the desperate struggle of so many countries simply to reach the most basic level of economic and social development.
43.	The recent United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries sharply focused international attention on this issue. That was useful, but in concentrating on the need for developed countries to raise the level of their official development assistance to a limited number of the poorest developing countries the Conference did not really get to the heart of the matter.
44.	The problems which face the developing countries are well known. They affect some of the developed countries also. They include the soaring cost of imported energy, inflated prices for manufactured imports and fluctuating prices for primary exports. These factors are compounded by increasing protectionist pressures in the advanced economies and a reluctance to contemplate the kind of restructuring which would expand trading opportunities for the developing countries.	^
45.	These problems cannot be solved by financial subsidies alone or even, in itself, by successful internal economic development. Economic self-sufficiency is not a practicable goal for the developing countries, nor is it for most developed countries. Even a modest level of prosperity and economic stability can only be achieved through a continuous expansion of international trade. This, in turn, can only be achieved in a different international climate, in which there is a better balance between access to manufactured goods and access to agricultural products. There is too great a tendency to concentrate on reducing barriers to trade in industrial manufactures and to push aside agriculture as some kind of an exception with which it is too difficult to cope. That cannot be allowed to continue.
46.	It is, surely, self-evident that successful economic development merely creates new problems unless there is a corresponding expansion of trading opportunities. What future is there if the rich countries continue to deny access in order to protect their own agricultures, if prices of agricultural exports fluctuate wildly or are distorted by subsidies and if those prices are far outstripped by the cost of essential industrial goods and services?
47.	The prosperity of my own country depends on the exp<M of a relatively small number of agricultural commodities. That means we share some of the problems faced by developing countries. We know what those problems are. Because we are small, and because we face economic difficulties ourselves, we try in a number of ways to ensure that our development assistance program is efficient and effective. All our aid is given in the form of grants. We make sure it is directed into the kind of projects in which New
Zealand has a recognized expertise. We never embark on a project unless it has been specifically asked for by the recipient Government. It makes sense for us to concentrate our aid efforts in the part of the world that we know best, that is, our immediate neighborhood. Almost 70 per cent of our bilateral development assistance is now channeled to the island nations of the South Pacific.
48.	In our view, the criteria for inclusion in the United Nations list of least developed countries are unduly narrow and rigid. Only one South Pacific country, at present, qualifies for inclusion in that list. A number of others, because they suffer from all the disadvantages of extremely small size, isolation and lack of resources, also deserve the special treatment accorded to the least developed. Indeed, if it were not for the level of aid they do receive, we believe they would qualify even under present criteria. I would certainly like to see those criteria revised and made more flexible.
49.	Because their populations are tiny and because of the poverty of their resources, many of the island nations of the South Pacific are going to have a long and hard struggle to become more viable. And yet their very smallness and isolation, which ought to make the world community more responsive to their special circumstances, has caused them to be overlooked by some of the major donors. Thus there is every reason for New Zealand to concentrate its aid efforts in the South Pacific, and we intend to continue that policy.
50.	External financial assistance, however essential, is not enough in itself to bring about successful development. New Zealand recognizes that the developing island countries need outlets for the goods they produce and has set about meeting that need in a practical manner. Together with Australia, we have joined in a treaty with our neighbors in the South Pacific to give them unrestricted duty-free access, on a nonreciprocal basis, for the great majority of their exports. We have also established an industrial development scheme to promote the growth of the manufacturing sector in the island economies through joint ventures with New Zealand firms. We have given strong support to the establishment of a regional shipping line to ensure that the exports of the island countries reach their markets.
51.	I make no boast that what we have achieved has solved the problems of our developing neighbors. Obviously not, since their economies are still for the most part in a precarious state.
52.	Economic and social development can progress smoothly only in conditions of political stability. Recent history has shown how true that is even in countries which are blessed with great natural wealth, and all the more starkly in others which are not. Sometimes the causes of instability have been internal. Too often they have been made far worse by external pressure, intervention or military invasion. At present there is dangerous instability in several widely separated areas of the world, including SouthEast Asia, SouthWest Asia, the Middle East, southern Africa, eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula.
53.	If I refer first to Kampuchea it is because that is the area of tension nearest to my own land; because New Zealand regards itself as a friend of the Association of
SouthEast Asian Nations [ASEANwhose members are neighbors of Kampuchea, Laos and Viet Nam; and because we believe the continuance of the situation in Kampuchea poses an eventual threat to our own security. External intervention in Kampuchea has been flagrant. There is no excuse for the continued presence of 200,000 Vietnamese troops in that country. New Zealand has consistently urged the need for a political settlement which would free the Kampuchean people from a foreign presence and permit them freely to choose their own Government. Such a settlement would enable Viet Nam to resume its own economic development, free from both the burden of maintaining its military occupation of a neighboring country and its present dependence on a single superPower for economic and military support.
54.	New Zealand cannot and does not condone the past crimes of Pol Pot and his associates. But, as the latest vote on Kampuchea's credentials shows, there is no disposition amongst the majority of Members of this Assembly to replace the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea by one representing a puppet Government propped up by a military occupation.
55.	We welcome the efforts that are being made to form a more broadly based successor to the present Democratic Kampuchean leadership. We expect that the International Conference on Kampuchea will continue its efforts to find a solution to the Kampuchean problem a solution which takes account of the legitimate interests of all sides. We hope that Viet Nam and the Soviet . Union will be persuaded to join in the negotiating process through the mediating efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee and the President of the Conference. The need for a settlement is urgent, for the longer the fighting continues' within Kampuchea, the greater the risk that it will spread beyond the borders of that war-torn land.
56.	Instability in SouthEast Asia is paralleled in SouthWest Asia by military intervention and continuing hostilities in Afghanistan. International concern will continue to be reiterated in this Assembly until Soviet forces are withdrawn. Whether or not the Soviet Union has come to regard that entanglement as a mistake, my Government most earnestly hopes that the Soviet Government will not compound that error and deal a final fatal blow to detente by similar action against the people of Poland.
57.	Almost since it began, this Organization has been trying to find a solution to the problem of a divided Korea. Yet there is still no genuine dialog between the leaders in the North and those in the South. The latest call by the Republic of Korea for a summit meeting between the two Koreas has been rejected. Surely the Korean people as a whole at least deserve that their leaders should talk seriously about the future of their country. It makes no sense for the two sides in that divided peninsula to go on forever pouring so much of their resources and energies into military preparations. My Government hopes that the authorities in the North will reconsider their stand.
58.	It is a matter of deep regret that all our hopes for urgent and positive steps towards a just and durable Middle East settlement should have had so little to sustain them. New Zealand welcomed the steps agreed upon by Israel and Egypt to restore peace between them. But the process cannot be allowed to come to a stop at this point.
During the last 12 months there has been a deplorable readiness to resort to violence. There is a need for a genuine and renewed commitment to the principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). There is a need for Israel's neighbors to accept and respect the existence of Israel as a sovereign and independent State. There is an equal need for a corresponding recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians, including the right to self-determination. That, in our view, means the right to establish a separate State if that is their wish. The annexation of East Jerusalem and the continuing establishment of settlements in the occupied territories are obstructions to a negotiated settlement. A resurgence of terrorism, a buildup of ever more sophisticated armaments, or recourse to preemptive military strikes simply threaten to undermine what has with such difficulty been accomplished so far. Only a genuine will to negotiate fairly and realistically will bring lasting results.
59.	In southern Africa we still see a people denied the right of nationhood. South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia must end. The Prime Minister of my country said in this forum at the 
thirty-fifth session [109th meeting] that there was no good reason why the few issues that remain outstanding in the search for a settlement in Namibia should not be .settled quickly. We believe that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) provides the basis for that settlement and we support the continuing efforts of those seeking to achieve the early and peaceful independence of Namibia.
60.	We deplore South Africa's aggressiveness against its neighbors and its violation of Angola's territory and sovereignty. In South Africa itself the detestable system of institutionalized racism and injustice apartheid remains entrenched. South Africa's black majority are denied the right to participate in the choice of their Government and are shut out from the full enjoyment of the resources of their own country.
61.	Change in South Africa is inevitable. Whether it will come peacefully or through violence is in South Africa's hands. Time, though, is running desperately short.
62.	We cannot expect international cooperation in bringing about economic and social development to flourish while confrontation and conflict persist in so many parts of the world. Heightened tension threatens not only detente but the orderly development of international law, the negotiation of arms control agreements and the promotion of human rights. ^National security and rearmament become matters of overriding priority for Governments. Legislatures tend to focus more determinedly on domestic political considerations, to the detriment of enlightened foreign policies. The humanitarian and altruistic instincts of ordinary people all too often become dulled. Their natural instinct for peace is overshadowed by a narrower and more belligerent patriotism. Thus is created an international climate inimical to the peaceful settlement of disputes and the orderly conduct of international relations.
63.	All those who have traditionally cherished the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms, of the individual, both at home and abroad, surely have a special duty to resist such dangerous trends and to throw their weight behind the negotiating process by which the United Nations seeks to achieve those objectives.
64.	A prime example is the development of a new law of the sea. A stable order for the oceans, the seabed and coastal waters is essential for world peace. It is most desirable, to say the least, that the major maritime Powers should participate in the new convention. This year the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been slowed down to permit a review of the draft convention by the United States Government. The Conference is now clearly determined to push on to finality in 1982. It is the earnest hope of my Government that, having completed its review, the United States will rejoin the negotiating process and will stand ready with all other nations to make a determined last effort to ensure the adoption by consensus of the draft convention at the next and final negotiating session of the Conference.
65.	In the field of human rights, the United Nations has concentrated, rightly, on the needs of people who are socially disadvantaged or who have been traditional victims of discrimination.
66.	A striking example is the United Nations Decade for Women, now at midpoint. The adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women [General Assembly resolution 34/180] has been one of its major achievements. It is significant that it has come into force so quickly. All nations, whatever their stage of economic development, their cultural traditions or their geographic circumstances, have been reminded not only of the rights of half of humanity but also of the enormous contribution made by women. It was right that the United Nations should lead that world movement, because the discrimination to be eliminated  the discrimination we must 'eliminate has been universal. The activities of the Decade have been followed with close attention in New Zealand and its aims have our full support. But the convention will only achieve its aim if it is universally ratified and, more important, given full effect in each country.
67.	Similarly, the current International Year of Disabled Persons has focused attention on the rights of handicapped people. It has provided impetus and the practical framework for action. In my own country, the response has been quite remarkable. A mass fund-raising effort for the disabled resulted in the largest collection of voluntary funds for a charitable purpose in our history. We have been made more aware than ever before not only of the needs of the disabled, but of the contribution they can make to our society as a whole.
68.	Next year we shall be summoned to the second special session devoted to disarmament. Nowhere is the need for a renewed effort to achieve progress in international negotiations more apparent. If we are honest, we must acknowledge that since the first special session the prospects for effective disarmament measures have not advanced. Indeed, they may have receded. Much of the work of the first session has been undercut by the deterioration in the international climate and in relations among the nuclear Powers. I do not consider it unfair to assign to those Powers the principle responsibility for that loss of impetus and to demand that they take the initiative in resuming serious and active negotiations. It is they who have the weapons which, by universal agreement, are the most dangerous and in most urgent need of control and numerical reduction. My delegation's keenest disappointment is that the negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, a step which could serve to check both horizontal and vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons, still hangs fire.

69.	Only the nuclear Powers can negotiate a test-ban treaty which will work or, for that matter, any agreement designed to reduce the threat of nuclear destruction. But the remaining Members of the United Nations have a duty to their peoples to renew their pressure on the nuclear Powers, who are also the largest manufacturers and purveyors of conventional armaments, to resume movement towards disarmament. In that regard, we welcome the decision of the two principal nuclear Powers to resume discussions on the reduction of nuclear weapons in the European theater.
70.	I referred earlier to some of the obstacles in the path of economic progress, especially for developing countries. There is no greater corisumer of development resources than the armaments industry, and none that is more wasteful. We must never lose patience in pursuing international agreements which will cut the burden and the danger of rearmament and strengthen the fragile fabric of peace.
71.	It is natural that each of us should seek to advance the interests of his own country, that we should work for the wellbeing of our own people. National pride and patriotism are admirable and necessary virtues. But every coin, every medallion, has another side. Nationalism and pride of country are not in themselves enough. All of us North and South, committed and uncommitted, East and West belong to one world. We have got to work together. Our world has become too small and too dangerous a place for any of us to pursue narrow nationalism regardless of the interests of others.
72.	We must move the world community away from the dangerous road it has been following: that is, the course of rivalry, confrontation and the naked struggle for power. It can lead only to conflict. We must learn, more than ever before, to couple national pride with a real commitment to international cooperation. There is, I believe, no other way to move ahead, to achieve a decent life for all our people. That, I suggest, is why we are meeting here. For all our peoples, whether our countries are large or small, have an equal right td peace, progress and justice.

"
6010,55,2000,AUS,"I join my colleagues in
congratulating the President on his election as
President of the General Assembly for its fifty-fifth
session and you, Madam Vice-President, on your
election to your position.
I am also delighted to welcome Tuvalu as the
189th Member of the United Nations. Australia has
long-standing and very friendly relations with Tuvalu,
and we have worked closely together as members of
the South Pacific Forum and the Commonwealth. We
are pleased that Tuvalu is now a Member of the United
Nations, and look forward to new opportunities to work
together for the United Nations common goals of peace
and development.
We meet today just after the largest number of
heads of State and Government in history gathered for
the Millennium Summit. While the Summit touched on
the multitude of problems facing the world at the start
of a new century, a theme common to many speeches
was the need for the United Nations to reform so as to
meet the challenges of the era: the challenges of
securing peace, of fighting poverty and of empowering
and liberating oppressed peoples.
I want to respond to those calls for reform in my
remarks to the Assembly today.
Without continuing commitment to reform, the
United Nations — like any organization — cannot
expect to keep up with rapid change in the
contemporary international environment. In the
absence of change and adaptation, the Organization
will wither as the nations of the world bypass it in
favour of institutions and mechanisms that are more
relevant to their needs.
Australians believe that the most fundamental
task of the Organization — and the very reason for its
creation at the end of the Second World War — is the
maintenance of international peace and security. In
recent years we have seen the United Nations perform
at both ends of the spectrum of relevance and
effectiveness: at a low point in addressing problems in
Kosovo and Rwanda, and at a high point in the
resolution of the conflict in East Timor.
I am a strong advocate of an active role for the
United Nations in the restoration and preservation of
international peace and security, especially in situations
where there may be imminent danger of humanitarian
catastrophe. Appropriate action by the United Nations
in these circumstances does more than perhaps
anything else to demonstrate the continuing relevance
of the Organization to an often sceptical international
public.
Today I want to focus attention on four aspects of
reform within the United Nations system: reform of the
Security Council; electoral group reconfiguration;
reform of peacekeeping; and reform of the human
rights treaty committee system. It is our view that
progress in each of these areas must be achieved to
enable the United Nations to deliver results and ensure
its relevance and effectiveness.
Reform and expansion of the Security Council is
driven by two fundamental, interrelated imperatives:
the need to restore the representative nature of the
Council by reconfiguring its composition to reflect the
size and diversity of contemporary United Nations
membership, and the need to enhance the Council's
credibility, authority and legitimacy.
The Australian Government's view has long been
that expansion in both categories of membership is
26

needed to restore balance and equity to the composition
of the Council. New permanent seats should be
assumed by the under-represented developing regions
of the world. New permanent seats should also be
allocated to the major industrialized Powers best able
to contribute to the maintenance of international peace
and security. Equally importantly, other Members of
the United Nations should be given the opportunity to
contribute directly to the work of the Council through
periodic participation as elected members. Expansion
of the non-permanent membership would enhance the
representative nature of the Council, enabling it to act
genuinely on behalf of the whole membership.
Australia has long voiced concerns about the veto
and continues to argue that there must be limitations on
its use. Of course, all permanent members of the
Council, old and new, must remain accountable for
their performance, and to this end any new
arrangements for the Council should be reviewed after
10 or 15 years.
Regrettably, discussion on Security Council
reform has failed to reach agreement on a package of
reforms in the six years since the Open-ended Working
Group was established. The impasse is disappointing,
and I hope that this session will give new impetus to
the reform effort. It is clear from statements at the
Millennium Summit, and during this debate, that there
is strong support for reform. Renewed commitment and
flexibility are needed from all sides.
In the recent debate about United Nations reform,
one key element has largely been missing. I refer to the
United Nations electoral groups. The electoral groups
were established to ensure that there was fair and
equitable representation on United Nations bodies, so
that all Members who wanted to make a contribution to
United Nations decision-making would have an
opportunity to do so. Now that three decades have
passed since the formalization of the present groups, it
is time that we focused on their relevance to present
and future geopolitical realities.
The current group system reflects the geopolitics
of the 1960s. Since that time, more than 60 nations
have joined the United Nations, leading to significant
disparities between the size of groupings and an
inadequate level of representation for some subregions.
In addition, the original rationale for the configuration
of the electoral groups has eroded, creating dissonance
in the way many Member States organize themselves
politically and electorally.
The previous realignment of groups in 1963 was a
long and difficult process, impelled by significant
changes to the United Nations system after the entry of
many newly independent States from Africa and Asia. I
recognize that group reconfiguration is no easy matter,
and accept that change now will be similarly complex.
For that very reason, we should delay no longer in
commencing a serious debate of these issues. While
there are many possible configurations for revised
electoral groupings, and many sensitivities around
altering the status quo, the dramatic global changes
since the current system came into force have created
historical anomalies that cry out to be redressed.
Australia looks forward to working with others to
achieve that goal.
As part of the Australian Government's
commitment to a strong and relevant United Nations,
we recently completed a review of the United Nations
human rights committee system, with the objective of
improving its effectiveness. The review proceeded
from our Government's commitment to the
international promotion and protection of human rights,
and a firm belief that the United Nations has a central
role to play.
Australia has a proud human rights record, and
we take our international rights and obligations
seriously. We are party to both human rights Covenants
and to the four conventions. Within Australia, which
has a strong civil society, human rights are protected by
a range of key civil and political mechanisms,
including a strong democratic tradition, our
Constitution, an independent judiciary, a free press and
wide-ranging anti-discrimination legislation.
Internationally, Australia is a strong proponent of the
universal application of human rights standards and is
committed to continued support for international
human rights protection.
We are concerned that the committees established
to monitor international compliance with human rights
treaties are beginning to lose credibility and
effectiveness because of the way they operate. It is also
important that the international protection system work
efficiently and effectively so that democratic countries,
such as Australia, which have a proud record of
extending generous humanitarian assistance can
continue to have the confidence and support of their
27

own domestic constituencies for such humanitarian
protection.
Australia's review found that the committees
need to adopt a more consistent approach to their role
and understand the pitfalls of simply accepting without
analysis the submissions put before them by non-
governmental organizations. It is important that
adequate recognition be given to the role and views of
Governments which are democratically elected and
which take their treaty commitments and reporting
obligations seriously. The committees also need to be
more balanced and strategic about targeting key human
rights offenders and avoid unfairly focusing their
criticism on countries with good human rights records.
For some years now Australia, together with a
number of other countries, including Canada, New
Zealand and Norway, has been advocating reform of
the treaty committees. Most recently, the Australian
Mission to the United Nations in Geneva hosted a
meeting of about 20 countries to discuss treaty
committee reform. The United Nations itself has also
recognized the need for reform of the treaty committee
system, and Australia has been fully supportive of
these international reform efforts.
Australia now intends to broaden such efforts by
spearheading a high-level diplomatic initiative to
garner broad support for reforms to improve the
functioning of the committees and professionalize their
operations. Reforms could include the provision of
adequate resources to the human rights treaty
committees, improvements in their working methods,
standardized rules of procedure when considering
States' reports and better consultation between the
committees themselves to coordinate reporting
timetables and to facilitate cooperative work on reform
issues.
But Australia does not have a monopoly on good
ideas, and we want to work closely with United
Nations officials and with like-minded countries to
make the treaty committee system work more
effectively for the good of all Member States and for
the protection of human rights.
We will therefore be talking widely with others to
develop concrete proposals for reform. We will raise
these issues in the General Assembly, at the
Commission on Human Rights and in other appropriate
meetings. We also think that the regular meetings of
States parties to the six human rights treaties should
discuss reform issues and provide guidance to the
respective committees on their working methods.
Australia wants to maximize the effectiveness of
the treaty bodies. We will not shy away from our
responsibilities, but will press for the reforms that are
needed to make the system work well and achieve its
objectives. If reform does not occur, the committee
system will increasingly be ignored and made
redundant. That would be a setback for the cause of
human rights.
I now turn to the matter of peacekeeping and the
maintenance of international security. Australia has a
long and honourable tradition as a participant in United
Nations peacekeeping operations, most recently in East
Timor, and I believe that the strength of our
commitment is reflected in the recent appointment by
the Secretary-General of Australian Major-General Tim
Ford as his Military Adviser. The experience of the
1990s has clearly shown that the ability of the United
Nations to meet an expanding and increasingly
complex range of peacekeeping demands is under
strain. The decade witnessed some important successes
in peacekeeping, notably in East Timor, but also some
smaller and frankly rather unheralded operations. It
also saw some tragic failures, the costs of which were
often measured in human lives.
I commend the Secretary-General's commitment
to blunt scrutiny and review of the United Nations
performance, including the reports on Srebrenica and
Rwanda. We particularly commend his initiative in
convening the Brahimi Panel on United Nations Peace
Operations. The Brahimi report (A/55/305) is a
landmark document, setting out a blueprint for
modernizing the United Nations peacekeeping and
related functions. We must move expeditiously to
consider its recommendations.
Let me highlight briefly five points that, in
Australia's view, are among the most significant
lessons of recent experiences.
First, military intervention must be used only as a
last resort. All efforts must be made to find peaceful
solutions. In this context, we welcome the Brahimi
report's emphasis on preventive action and peace-
building.
Secondly, when the United Nations is deployed,
there must be a peace to keep. There are real dangers in
sending troops indefinitely into harm's way in the
28

absence of a clear peace plan and reasonable prospects
of achieving it. Disputing parties must be committed to
peace and must be held accountable for their actions.
Thirdly, peace operations must have a mandate
from the Security Council that is appropriate to the job
they are being asked to do. If the environment is
hostile, they must be appropriately equipped and able
to project credible force.
Fourthly, deployment must take place quickly
once a decision is taken by the Security Council.
Delays can lead to the further deterioration of a
situation and can cost lives. The Brahimi report offers a
number of useful ideas to speed deployment which
merit careful consideration.
Fifthly, United Nations peace operations must
have a clear exit strategy. This is linked in particular to
the clarity of Council mandates: as the Brahimi report
rightly stresses, mandates must be clear, credible and
achievable. It is also linked to the efficacy of
accompanying peace processes and peace-building
efforts.
We welcome the attention given to these issues in
the Brahimi report. We also support the point that the
United Nations must be given the resources it needs to
carry out the demands that we make of it. There is no
question that the Department of Peacekeeping
Operations needs to be strengthened and reformed.
Ultimately, it is our responsibility, as Member States,
to support a stronger and more effective United Nations
peacekeeping capacity. This includes placing the
financing of peacekeeping on a surer footing and
paying our assessed contributions in full and on time.
I cannot conclude without referring to the
question of East Timor. When I addressed this
Assembly one year ago East Timor was in the throes of
the most appalling violence at the hands of a brutal and
lawless militia. Since then important progress has been
made in restoring security and building the foundations
of an independent East Timor. Australia pays tribute to
the men and women of the International Force in East
Timor and of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor for their commitment
and, in too many cases, their sacrifice.
East Timor faces a long and difficult path to
peace and prosperity. Australia is playing a major role
in the territory's reconstruction through the United
Nations and other organizations, as well as bilaterally.
We are committed for the long term to helping the East
Timorese build their emerging nation not only for the
benefit of the East Timorese, but in the interests of
stability and security in our region.
Regrettably, the pro-integration militia continue
to pose a significant threat to security and stability.
Intimidation and violence against Timorese refugees
and humanitarian aid personnel in the camps on the
East-West Timor border must be halted. The killing of
workers of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) earlier this
month deserves the world's strongest condemnation.
Australia reiterates its call on Indonesia to fulfil its
responsibility to provide effective security in West
Timor, including by bringing to an end militia activity,
bringing to justice those responsible for crimes,
creating the necessary conditions for the return of
UNHCR and resolving the refugee situation. We urge
the Indonesian authorities to take all possible steps in
this direction, including cooperating with the proposed
Security Council mission.
If the United Nations is to remain relevant and
credible, it must work on its strengths and maintain a
strong commitment to a continuing programme of
reform and renewal. The challenges that face the
Organization are formidable, but not insurmountable.
The need for change is clear and urgent, but I believe
that it is not beyond the ingenuity and good will of our
generation to emulate our predecessors in grasping the
reform nettle.
At the Millennium Summit the world's leaders
highlighted the need for the United Nations to meet the
challenges of the new century. Let us heed their call,
and work together with renewed determination and
commitment to make this Organization mo"
6039,55,2000,NRU,"Mr. President, allow me
to join previous speakers in congratulating you on your
assumption of the presidency of the fifty-fifth session
of the General Assembly. Nauru, like your
Government, has full confidence in your ability to
conduct the affairs the Assembly effectively and
efficiently. Through you, Sir, Nauru congratulates the
outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben
Gurirab, Foreign Minister of Namibia, for a job well
done which climaxed with the successful and
unprecedented Millennium Summit.
The Republic of Nauru has just passed its first
anniversary as a Member of this esteemed Organization
with a Permanent Mission in New York that is just nine
months old. The admission of our brother island from
the Pacific, Tuvalu, as the 189th Member of the
Organization, is a most welcome development. On
behalf of my Government, I extend to Tuvalu our warm
welcome into the brotherhood of nations.
My delegation commends the Secretary-General,
Mr. Kofi Annan, and his team at the Secretariat for
their well-crafted report entitled “We the peoples: the
role of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.
The report has captured, in one document, the agony
and ecstasy of the United Nations as it journeyed
through its triumphs and failures over the past 55 years
of its existence.
The purpose of our presence in this parliament of
the peoples of the United Nations is not to bask in the
ecstasy of past achievements but to pledge anew our
commitment and determination to face the problems
that continue to confront humanity, and to support the
launching of the United Nations on a new crusade to
engage the tempestuous challenges encapsulated in
chapter VII of the Secretary-General's report. In
conjunction with this, the heads of State or
Government of Member States have mandated the
Assembly, by their solemn act of adopting the outcome
document, to implement the call for action.
It is further encouraging to hear Foreign
Ministers expound upon and reinforce the
commitments that their respective heads of State or
22

Government made at the Millennium Summit. It is now
for the doers to deliver the goods, so to speak. It is here
that the greatest challenges lie. It is indisputable that
the issues before us are not new but are unfinished
business, and the most difficult on which to make
progress. The problem is in the interaction between
Member States for the purpose of delivering agreed
instruments that will act as platforms by which
Member States will be obligated to adopt and
implement at the national level.
It is therefore my delegation's strong view that
our first priority is to revitalize and further strengthen
the foundation for collaboration and cooperation
among Member States on the one hand, and between
the United Nations and the appropriate
intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental
organizations on the other. That is, not only must we
resolve to provide the United Nations with the
allocated resources and processes to perform its tasks
effectively, but we must also repair the negative
undercurrents and detrimental practices that inhibit the
achievement of desired outcomes.
In this regard, Nauru considers the following
actions to be necessary steps towards this goal.
First, we must revitalize the work and restore the
authority of the General Assembly as the only
universally representative body of the United Nations.
Second, there is a need to address the ongoing
marginalization of the smaller and less affluent
Member States.
Third, we must expedite the reform of the
Security Council. Nauru believes that an expansion in
Security Council membership is the politically correct
action to take, and we urge participants and facilitators
alike to expedite the work of the Working Group.
Fourth, the preference for unanimity as the means
of deciding on issues under consideration is, in our
view, a major factor behind the delay in reaching
agreed solutions and has on more than one occasion
resulted in the dilution of outcomes. Setting such a
high standard, when the principal organs of the United
Nations come to decisions on a two-thirds majority
basis, is self-defeating. Nauru takes the view that a
unanimous outcome should be a target only, and not a
rule.
Fifth, financial resources need to be shored up.
The timely and unconditional payment of assessed
contributions will enable the United Nations to
discharge its responsibilities in a timely manner.
Voluntary contributions are also a very essential source
of funds to support the work of the subsidiary bodies
and agencies through trust funds established under the
United Nations. Nauru commends those Member States
that contribute to such trust funds over and above their
assessed contributions, and we also recognize and
praise the important contribution that private trust
funds such as the Ted Turner Foundation make to the
work of the United Nations and its main agencies.
Sixth, a number of covenants remain dormant due
either to the lack of signatories to bring them into force
or to the lack of ratification by States that have signed.
We thus call for all States to make a commitment to
bringing outstanding international agreements into
force.
Seventh, the Secretary-General's reform
initiatives of 1997 must be brought to bear in the
shortest time possible so that the limited resources of
the United Nations are put to work more on the
programmes of action and less on running the
administrative machineries. We urge that the
Secretariat continue to review its operations on a
timely basis as it strives to do more with less.
The President of the Republic of Nauru, in his
intervention in the round-table discussion, expressed
his disappointment that the core responsibilities of the
United Nations regarding the rights of peoples to self-
determination and freedom from alien domination did
not rank as importantly as the other issues currently
before us. The fact that there are still 17 countries
listed in the Special Political and Decolonization
Committee, coupled with the non-settlement of long-
standing disputes between States over their borders,
and the continuing existence of stateless people, may
be indicative of the priority that these issues receive
within the United Nations.
For Nauru, the continued refusal of the United
Nations to deal with the plight of the millions of
Chinese on the island of Taiwan is tantamount to
avoiding its core responsibilities. By no stretch of the
imagination could we be convinced that the Republic
of China on Taiwan is a province of China. Nauru has
no doubt that the condition that unification should take
place through “peaceful” means, adopted by the United
States and its allies as part of their “one China” policy,
has helped maintain relative calm in the region. It is
23

incumbent upon the United Nations, under the
appropriate Articles of the Charter, and the
international community to find a lasting solution to
the problem. The United Nations cannot claim to be a
truly universally representative world body as long as
the people of Taiwan continue to be excluded from this
Organization.
East Timor is a classic case of the United Nations
not paying attention to the concerns of the Pacific
region. Undoubtedly, had the United Nations, through
the Security Council, acted at the time it was prompted
to do so by the Governments of the region, the human
carnage and immeasurable damage to property would
have been far less, and perhaps even avoided
altogether.
It is in this vein that Nauru is raising the matter of
West Papua. Our head of State stated Nauru's position
on the issue in his intervention at the Millennium
Summit, and I will therefore not repeat it here.
However, the Nauru Mission to the United Nations has
been instructed to take the necessary steps towards
putting together a resolution on West Papua's call for a
new and democratically run referendum on the
question of independence from Indonesia, in the spirit
of the 1962 New York Agreement between the
Netherlands and Indonesia. We ask for the Assembly's
support of this just cause.
Flowing from these issues of security and peace
is the issue of the safety and survival of humankind
from weapons of mass destruction, illicit trade in small
arms and light weapons and the pandemic of the
HIV/AIDS virus. Despite the establishment of several
initiatives by the United Nations in its effort to make
progress on and expedite the question of disarmament,
it is sad to note that progress is at a snail's pace, due
mainly to resistance by most nuclear-weapon States to
disarm. In the Pacific region, which has been declared
a nuclear-weapon-free zone by the Rarotonga Treaty,
the transboundary shipment of nuclear fuel and other
radioactive material in the waters of States parties to
the Waigani Convention are banned. Our efforts
through the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
process, as well as bilateral and multilateral initiatives
to protect our ecosystem and seas against accidents
from these shipments in the high seas of our region,
have been met with strong opposition by shipping
States that, unlike us, are not dependent on the sea and
its ecosystem for their livelihoods.
In this regard, Nauru supports the call by the
Secretary-General to convene a special session of the
General Assembly to address the nuclear disarmament
issue, as we are not satisfied with the pace of progress
in the other forums.
At the other end of the scale, small arms and light
weapons obtained through illicit trade account for
much of the political, ethnic and criminal killings and
human suffering that occur in the less affluent
countries of the world. The tranquil South Pacific has
not been spared from this deadly trade. The United
Nations will be convening the first Conference on the
Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All
its Aspects next year, and it is our hope that Member
States will not put national political interests ahead of
the desires of the international community to eradicate
this illegal and offensive activity.
International efforts to contain the HIV/AIDS
epidemic from spreading have not been successful in
the least developed and developing countries,
particularly in Africa. The prohibitive cost of treatment
and social attitudes are the major constraints that these
countries face in combating the pandemic. We are
satisfied with the efforts of the United Nations to
combat the epidemic, efforts that are largely being
carried out through the World Health Organization and
the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.
However, it is obvious that the United Nations needs
the help of affluent countries to provide medicine and
medical experts in support of its efforts. In this regard,
Nauru has joined in the sponsorship of a draft
resolution calling on the General Assembly to take up
the issue and deal with it under its authority.
Poverty continues to be the major concern for the
developing world. The fact that the number of least
developed countries is stagnant at 48, with the
possibility of another 3 countries being added to the
list, is testimony to the fact that current programmes
are not working. The Secretary General's report
entitled “We the peoples” lists some ambitious
initiatives to accomplish freedom from want for
humanity. We strongly endorse the call for setting time-
bound goals in making resolute commitments to the
world's poorest and most vulnerable. Next year's
conference on least developed countries and financing
for development will be our first test since the
Millennium Summit of our sincerity to move from
rhetoric to action on the important issue of poverty
alleviation.
24

The Pacific is a region that demands special
attention. Projections by the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific estimate growth
in the Pacific region to be only about 2 per cent during
the next three years, as compared to around 6 per cent
for the rest of Asia. My own country is expected to
experience several more years of negative growth, as
our single resource and industry — phosphate —
comes to the end of its natural life.
Small island developing States, and the Pacific
islands in particular, face special difficulties is making
the transition to globalization. They will need time to
adjust to changes in the external trade regime and to
the consequent changes in their economies. Our
particular vulnerabilities should be recognized as
justifying special consideration to deal with such issues
as the global process of trade liberalization. The
removal of special protective regimes continues to
occur.
The South Pacific Applied Geoscience
Commission has been developing an environmental
vulnerability index with input from both the United
Nations and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Nauru,
along with the other small island developing States in
the Pacific, is gratified at the support it has received
from several developed countries to finance the project
to fruition. We urge that this work be incorporated into
the work of the United Nations, especially into the
work of the Committee for Development Policy and
that of the Bretton Woods institutions.
For all of us in the Pacific, the ocean is our major
resource. It provides us with food, income from the
sale of fish stocks caught in our respective zones and,
through the natural cycle of evaporation and
condensation, it is also a vital source of our fresh
water. It may also prove to be the source of the demise
of many low-lying Pacific islands from global warming
and the resultant rise in sea levels. The Rio Conference
in 1992 provided the foundations for international
action. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer is an important step forward.
But those responses may prove to be too few, too
little and too late for many small islands. We urge the
community of nations to implement the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol. Nations and the private sector must
incorporate “green accounting” into their practices in
order to integrate the environment into economic
policy. Suitable regulations and incentives need to be
designed into the web of governance.
Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of
Action continue to be the guiding principles for the
sustainable development of our region and the
protection of our environments. My delegation is
pleased to note that the World Bank has adopted much
of the relevant language in its programmes but it, and
the rest of the developed countries, need to commit to
maintain and, where possible, to expand overall levels
of support for small States' development, in terms of
both advocacy and the provision of technical
assistance.
Fishing offers the best hope for the future
sustenance of the smaller island countries that have no
mineral resources and/or tourism to contribute to the
national treasury. Nauru therefore reaffirms the
importance of the sustainable integrated management
and conservation of living marine resources in the
world's oceans, and the obligations of States to
cooperate to that end. We again call for an end to
unsustainable and damaging practices, such as drift-net
fishing, offshore dumping and high-seas pollution.
Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a threat to
the economic development of coastal States in the
Pacific, Caribbean and Latin American regions, whose
national incomes are heavily dependent on the export
of fish. The efforts by the United Nations to convene
the first open-ended informal consultative process on
the oceans and the Law of the Sea has enabled States to
address those issues with a view to reporting the
deliberations of the consultation to the General
Assembly for its consideration and further action.
Another area where small States, including our
own, have been successful in generating income for the
national treasury is in the provision of onshore and
offshore financial services. However, pressure has been
applied by the Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering and the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to blacklist
countries that do not meet the anti-money-laundering
standards of those international bodies. We understand
and accept the need to have an anti-money-laundering
regime, and many small island States have gone a long
way to implement those requirements.
For its part, the Government of Nauru recently
issued a letter of commitment to the United Nations
Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention to
25

undertake the United Nations minimum performance
standards on anti-money-laundering initiatives.
Regrettably, the compliance level has been raised
unilaterally by the OECD to include harmful tax
competition — which has nothing to do with money-
laundering and other financial crimes. This is wrong in
international law and violates both the letter and spirit
of many United Nations resolutions regarding the
intervention of international organizations in the
domestic jurisdiction of States. Such unilateral action
is not acceptable to Nauru.
For the Pacific region, the question of the
equitable representation of the 11 Pacific island
countries in the bodies and commissions of the United
Nations is of vital importance. Until 20 years ago, it
may have been reasonable to have Australia and New
Zealand in the Group of Western European and other
States and a handful of Pacific islands in the Asian
Group. However, with the increase in membership
since that time, and the addition of a number of Pacific
island nations in recent times, it is incumbent upon the
United Nations to review the groupings.
Oceania is a distinct and internationally
recognized region of the world. The Asian Group
presently constitutes member countries from the
Middle East, Central Asia, China, Japan, the two
Koreas, the member countries of the Association of
South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Pacific
island countries. The 11 Pacific island countries are
drowning in the Asian Group, while Australia and New
Zealand, the godfathers of the Pacific island countries,
are marooned in the Group of Western European and
other States.
The parliaments of the ASEAN member
countries, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Pacific
island countries are members of a regional body called
the Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians Union. It is a well-
recognized body in the various regional and
international parliamentary forums. This model could
be used as the basis for a new regional group within the
United Nations, with the inclusion of Australia and
New Zealand. In our view, this new grouping would
provide the best opportunity for those Member States
to be equitably represented in the work of the United
Nations.
In conclusion, Nauru would like to reiterate the
importance of Member States making concerted efforts
to strengthen the fundamentals of multilateralism. At
the same time, the United Nations must assert its
leadership role through the coordination of all key
players in keeping the peace and fighting poverty and
transboundary crimes, as well as with regard to
humanitarian initiatives, the protection of human rights
and the rights of the child, and in the fight against
inequity and inequality. Only through such
collaborative efforts can we move the United Nations
in the direction that our leaders have agreed it must go.











"
6043,55,2000,VUT,"Allow me first of all to
convey the apologies of the Minister of Foreign Affairs
of Vanuatu, The Honourable Serge Vohor, who is
unable to be here on this historic occasion due to most
pressing commitments at home. I am therefore very
deeply honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of
the delegation of the Republic of Vanuatu.
At the outset I wish to congratulate Mr. Harri
Holkeri on his election to this historic session of the
General Assembly. My delegation is confident that
with his vast experience and diplomatic skills, he will
guide this Assembly to a successful conclusion. I
would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute
to his predecessor, who so ably guided the fifty-fourth
session of the General Assembly.
Allow me also to congratulate Tuvalu as the
newest Member of our family of nations. As a small
island State, and, more significantly, a member of the
South Pacific region, Vanuatu is very pleased to
welcome Tuvalu. Vanuatu certainly hopes a further
increase in the Pacific island membership would be a
positive step in the region's economic and political
development as we embark on the twenty-first century.
Small island States, including Vanuatu, are
continuously confronted by difficult and challenging
issues, which must be addressed at this summit. For the
Pacific region, its key features are its immense
geographic spread, its small land and population base
and limited natural resources, and its vulnerability to
economic and natural shocks, which inevitably have an
impact on its physical infrastructure and economic
development. Dependence has been on a few fragile
commodity markets and fickle tourist income.
One of our greatest challenges is education for
all. The Human Poverty Index of the Pacific Island
26

Countries shows Vanuatu as the third last of the least
developed countries. Vanuatu shares the view that the
key to development and success is education. As a
signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child
and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women, Vanuatu is committed
to this cause. However, limited financial and human
resources continue to hinder development in this area.
Vanuatu welcomes the initiative taken by the
Secretary-General, in his address to the Dakar World
Education Forum, held in April 2000, to build a global
partnership for girls' education. Vanuatu will be
pleased to be part of this global initiative. At the same
time, Vanuatu fully supports the view that involving
women as central players in development provides
benefits in the areas of nutrition, health, and savings
and reinvestment at the family, community, and,
ultimately, national level. Nevertheless, the challenge
of ensuring education for all at all levels is an
ambitious objective that will require external
assistance. The education and training of the
population, including women, must therefore be an
important goal of the Assembly.
One of the great obstacles to our economic
development, including our foreign investment
portfolio, has always been the relatively high cost of
public utilities, in particular the energy sector, which is
largely dependent on traditional oil-based systems. The
cost of importing oil products and petroleum-derived
gas is currently about 90 per cent of our combined
domestic exports. Our economy cannot afford this
trend in the long run.
We believe that with access to the new and
relevant technology available in the developed
countries today, the Republic of Vanuatu and other
small island nations can develop integrated renewable
energy systems and hydrogen fuels if our potential
wind- and sun-related and geothermal and
hydroelectricity resources can be fully utilized.
Access to financial and technical resources from
the developed countries can assist countries like the
Republic of Vanuatu in moving in the right direction
and thereby positively contribute to our common
objective of creating a healthier and more environment-
friendly economic development.
The emergence of new information technology
today underlines the strong linkage between the
concepts of knowledge and power. While
communications and business transactions through the
Internet and other modern electronic means have now
become routine within the circles of the rich and the
powerful, the large majority of the world's population,
which lives in the poor developing countries, has very
little or no knowledge about — let alone any access
to — this new and revolutionary way of doing day-to-
day business.
In this new millennium, the new information
technology must be made accessible and affordable to
the people living in the most remote areas of the
developing nations in order to facilitate their access to
better education, better health services and give them
greater access to world markets and business
opportunities. This is a great challenge, but one that we
must face together, and proudly. That is why we have
the United Nations.
Last month the national Parliament of Vanuatu
passed two laws in this area — the Electronic
Transactions Act and the E-Business Act. We hope
that, through the support of relevant United Nations
agencies and bilateral development partners, we will be
able to fully implement these new laws for the benefit
of our small island nation and its people, in particular
in the rural and remote areas.
In his statement to the Millennium Summit, my
Prime Minister highlighted the need for the
industrialized countries immediately to ratify
international treaties on the protection and sustainable
management of our natural environment and resources,
which are vital to the very survival of millions of
citizens of small island States. Environmental
degradation poses a serious threat to the small island
States, which are threatened by the rising sea level. We
continue to urge countries to adopt and ratify the Kyoto
Protocol as soon as possible. As a signatory to the
Framework Convention on Climate Change, Vanuatu is
in the process of adding its signature to the Protocol.
We cannot let this opportunity pass without
expressing our serious concern about the great
difficulties a least developed country such as the
Republic of Vanuatu is facing with regard to its
application to join the World Trade Organization
(WTO), because some powerful countries, in particular
the United States of America, refuse to recognize our
constant call for special consideration. Vanuatu has
been in the complex process of accession for five and a
half years. The negotiations we were engaged in until
27

last October with a number of major bilateral and
multilateral players, such as the European Union,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and
Switzerland, have been completed in a spirit of
understanding and appreciation of Vanuatu's
circumstances.
The United States continues to place heavy and
unreasonable demands on us, which we cannot accept.
We consider those demands absurd, because the United
States is among our least significant trading partners.
We believe that Vanuatu has become the innocent
victim of global trade disputes between the big players.
While we have always supported the principle of
free international trade, we expect the new regime to be
more realistic and more flexible, to allow ample time
for the small and least developed countries to adjust to
the new rules. After all, the WTO cannot be considered
as a truly global trade regime without the adhesion of
all independent countries, including small island
States.
It is no secret, as the Vanuatu Prime Minister
clearly stated at the recent G-77 Summit in Havana,
that the conditions being imposed on us for joining the
WTO are simply beyond our capacity to consider in the
short to medium term. Unless the powerful countries
review their positions and conditions with regard to our
application, then the Republic of Vanuatu will have no
other choice but to reconsider its original application to
join the WTO.
On a related issue, we would also like to take this
opportunity to register our most sincere recognition to
all the Governments in the Pacific and other regions for
their consistent support for Vanuatu's status as a least
developed country. We continue to maintain our strong
belief that the United Nations criteria for assessing
least developed country status must be fully reviewed
and must take into account new indices, such as the
Environmental Vulnerability Index, and the long-term
impacts of such natural disasters as cyclones, tsunamis
and others on countries' social and economic
advancement.
Enhancing the role of the peacekeeping forces of
the United Nations must also be a priority for this
Assembly. It is in this spirit that Vanuatu commends
the Brahimi report on peacekeeping, believing that,
once implemented, it will allow the United Nations to
carry out its peacekeeping operations effectively. At
this juncture, I am proud to say that, in spite of our
meagre resources, Vanuatu is participating, for the first
time in its 20-year history as an independent nation, in
United Nations peacekeeping missions in East Timor
and Bosnia. Prior to this attainment, Vanuatu also
served in some regional peace-monitoring missions.
In his statement to the Millennium Summit, the
Prime Minister of Vanuatu touched on an important
issue: the principle of self-determination and the
related question of West Papua. The case of West
Papua has always been high on Vanuatu's agenda. In
1984, the late Prime Minister and father of our
independence, Walter Hadye Lini, said:
“We may not have the resources to support
their struggle, but we can remember them in our
everyday prayers. For when we talk about their
struggle, we must always use the name that was
very dear to them: West Papua.”
The United Nations must be consistent in its
decisions concerning the recognition and respect of the
fundamental right to self-determination of the people
of West Papua. The truth surrounding the so-called act
of free choice must be exposed to the Melanesian
sisters and brothers of West Papua and to the rest of the
international community. Saddest of all was General
Assembly resolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969 on West
Papua. How can the United Nations continue to ignore
the cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?
This year marks the end of the International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It is only
appropriate that the United Nations should reconsider
and revisit the decisions taken at that time. Following
the tragedy in East Timor, Vanuatu believes that it is
not too late for the international community to act to
halt a similar tragedy in West Papua. In this context,
Vanuatu would like to strongly request that the issue of
West Papua be placed for discussion on the agenda of
the Committee of 24. Any move to oppose this will
most certainly undermine the credibility of the United
Nations and its decisions on this special case. Over the
past few decades, the United Nations has positively
contributed to the process of decolonization. We must
not allow this opportunity to pass.
On the question of reform, we agree that any
reforms should include the Security Council in order to
make it more democratic and transparent. The
membership of the Security Council should be enlarged
not only to enhance geographic representation, but also
in response to the aspirations felt at all levels of the
28

world community and to the voice of the least
developed countries and small island States.
Vanuatu would like to congratulate all those
countries that recognize the need for a proper
evaluation and assessment of the crisis situations in Fiji
and the Solomon Islands prior to taking punitive
measures, if any. We in the Republic of Vanuatu
believe that traditional economic and other forms of
sanctions against individual countries in times of crisis
should be fully reviewed in this new millennium. In
this respect, the delegation of Vanuatu would like to
express its sincere appreciation to Sir John Kaputin,
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Papua New Guinea,
who so ably led the Pacific ministerial mission of the
African-Caribbean-Pacific Group of States to Fiji and
the Solomon Islands in order to carefully assess the
situation in the two countries. The mission was also
comprised of the Foreign Minister of the Cook Islands,
Mr. Robert Woonton; the Minister for Foreign Affairs
of Vanuatu; and the Minister of Education of Samoa,
Ms. Fiame Naomi Mata'afa.
I would also like to take this opportunity to
commend Mr. Laisenia Qarase, Prime Minister and
Minister for National Reconciliation and Unity in the
Interim Administration of the Republic of the Fiji
Islands, for his eloquent statement on the situation in
Fiji. We would also like to extend our appreciation to
Mr. Danny Philip, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the
Solomon Islands, for his comprehensive statement.
We have made visionary statements. Now is the
time for us to translate these into action. We have
called for a more efficient, responsive and effective
United Nations. We must muster the good will to
resolutely implement the Millennium Declaration and
to rededicate ourselves to upholding the fundamental
principles of the United Nations. Let us not lose sight
of these goals.






"
6069,55,2000,PLW,"It is indeed an honour and a
privilege for me to address this body on behalf of the
Government and the people of the Republic of Palau.
President Kuniwo Nakamura sends his warm greetings
and wishes everyone a successful deliberation during
this fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. He
also wishes to congratulate and welcome the newest
Member of the United Nations, our good Pacific
neighbour and friend, Tuvalu.
During the recently concluded Millennium
Summit, we addressed many global issues that pose
problems and threats to mankind at the national,
regional and international levels. These problems must
be seriously looked into by this body and other
international and regional organizations so that their
solutions may be found or remedies provided to
alleviate the suffering they impose on our world and its
peoples. These problems – ranging from hunger,
poverty, tuberculosis, malaria and the spread of
HIV/AIDS to global warming and environmental
degradation and vulnerability – are not just the
responsibilities of the countries or regions that are most
affected; every member of the global community must
play its part in order for this planet and its inhabitants
to survive these destructive forces.
Today, we live in an era in which the production
of food is at an all-time high. Advanced technology in
the area of food production, improved farming and
agricultural methods are readily available and can be
successfully applied to widespread areas that are
traditionally not suitable to agriculture and farming.
In a similar context, medical research and
information can and should be shared universally. An
integrated approach to intervention in the field of
HIV/AIDS is critically called for in many developing
countries. Collaborative health-research projects
focusing on the biology of this disease and the
development of tools for its prevention and control —
including  diagnostics, drugs and vaccines — must also
be made available and affordable to the many third
world countries seriously plagued by this disease. As a
global community charged with the responsibility for
the security of mankind, we must confront the real
danger of HIV/AIDS and work collectively towards the
eradication of that horrible disease.
Uncontrolled and unregulated human activities
have affected and will continue to affect our
ecosystem, thereby endangering and threatening our
very existence. Global warming is a difficult and
scientifically complicated phenomenon. Even today,
scientists are still divided on this issue, particularly on
its causes and effects. While some agree that the
emission of greenhouse gases and human and industrial
activities are responsible for climate change and global
warming, others maintain that the changes occur
naturally and that, because the earth is so resilient to
such changes, none of these occurrences will have
permanent effects.
However, as a small island country in the Pacific,
Palau has seen and experienced the actual impact of sea
level rise, unpredicted weather patterns and an extreme
rise in sea water temperature, all of which are signs and
indications of global warming and climate change.
Many island countries all over the world have also
experienced these catastrophic changes. Let us, as
world leaders, work individually and collectively
towards the real resolution of global warming. The
blueprint and foundation of this important task are set
23

forth in the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. Let us fulfil
our roles.
During the Millennium Summit, we also
presented institutional issues that should be seriously
considered by the entire membership of this
Organization. Two further issues were raised by Palau
during the Summit: open membership and
representational participation in all bodies of the
United Nations. The lack of action on these issues on
our part, as a body, is quite contrary and detrimental to
the objectives of the United Nations.
With regard to open membership, Palau believes
that any State that meets the traditional and standard
definition of independent State should be allowed
membership in the United Nations. To that end, it is the
position of the Republic of Palau that the contributions
of Taiwan to the global community, particularly the
developing countries, more than qualify the Republic
of China on Taiwan to fully participate in the United
Nations as a full-fledged Member. We strongly support
full membership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in
the United Nations and appeal to all States members of
this body for their support.
Countless achievements concerning the welfare
and security of this planet and its inhabitants have been
accomplished by this body since its inception 55 years
ago. Many important organs and bodies within the
United Nations have been created, and some have even
been reorganized since then to further promote and
enhance the institution's objectives and goals.
However, one very important organ within the
United Nations system, the Security Council, has
remained virtually unchanged since its inception. Palau
truly believes that this important organ should be
reorganized and restructured to increase both
permanent and non-permanent members in order to
strengthen the Council's work and effectiveness. We,
therefore, maintain our support of the Millennium
Declaration, expressing the determination to intensify
our efforts to achieve a more comprehensive reform of
the Security Council.
Reform can only materialize if we all agree to a
common formula by which the number of permanent
and non-permanent members should be increased. The
Republic of Palau further maintains that any increase in
the permanent membership of the Security Council
should reflect a Member State's contribution to
international peace and security and its capability to
effectively carry out the objectives of the Council. A
few countries have surely reached that plateau to serve
as permanent members of the Security Council.
Finally, the Republic of Palau reaffirms its
commitment to global partnerships in this world of
interdependent economies as an essential step towards
the achievement of sustainable development. At the
fifty-fourth United Nations General Assembly, the Vice
President of the Republic of Palau, His Excellency
Thomas Remengesau, Jr., addressed the Assembly and
spoke of a tri-partite scientific project involving the
United States of America, Japan and Palau that was
still in its developmental phase. I am deeply honoured
today to inform this Assembly that last month the
Government of Japan completed the constructional
phase of the project and officially handed over the
facility to the Government of the Republic of Palau.
The next phase is to furnish the facility with the right
equipment and tools necessary for scientific research.
When fully completed, the Centre will provide
scientists and researchers with a state-of-the-art facility
for research in the area of coral reefs and marine
organisms. Medical research can and will also be
conducted in this facility. In addition, the Centre will
serve as a tourist attraction, as different exhibits on
marine life and a large aquarium will be on display.
At this juncture, I would like to convey our
gratitude and thanks to the Governments of Japan and
the United States of America for their support in this
noble endeavour and welcome any input and
contributions from the scientists and researchers of the
rest of the Member States to utilize the facility, since
we all work towards the common goal of safeguarding
and utilizing our environment for the betterment of
humanity.
The Palau International Coral Reef Centre project
is a clear example of cooperation between developed
and developing nations in promoting sustainable
development. Financial resources and mechanisms,
environmental utility and transfer of sound technology,
cooperation and capacity-building have been made
available to support this important initiative.
The Republic of Palau continues to be challenged
and challenges every Member State to build on the
achievements of the last eight years that have passed
since the Rio Summit, to look critically at the problems
24

that are still facing us and to make firm commitments
on further progress.






"
6076,55,2000,NZL,"I begin by joining
others who have congratulated you, Mr. President, on
your election. I also assure you of the New Zealand
delegation's full cooperation as you carry out your
important duties.
I also welcome the admission last week of our
neighbour and friend Tuvalu into the United Nations.
The admission of four new Pacific nations in the space
of a year contributes to the truly universal character of
the Organization.
This general debate is taking place at the start of
a new century and a new millennium. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan has called upon the Member
States of the United Nations to harness the symbolic
power of the millennium to meet the real and urgent
needs of people in every part of the world. This is an
appropriate time to recommit ourselves to the beliefs,
the values and the principles that led to the birth of the
Organization 55 years ago.
Like many other Members of the Organization,
New Zealand is a small country that tries to take a
principled and independent view of the world. In 1945,
in San Francisco, we played an active part through the
Labour Prime Minister of the day, Peter Fraser, in
framing the Charter in which heads of State and
Government reaffirmed their faith here last week.
We have always viewed the maintenance of
international peace and security, and the practical task
of peacekeeping, as key roles of the United Nations.
We are currently making our largest-ever contribution
to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in East
Timor. This commitment underlines our full support for
the central role of the United Nations in building a
stable, democratic and economically viable East Timor
in partnership with its people. So do the non-military
personnel and development assistance we have
provided to help the East Timorese create essential
services.
Just over a year ago, the East Timorese people
voted overwhelmingly for an independent future, and I
had the privilege of being part of the United Nations
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) group that oversaw
that electoral process. We recall the horrors which
followed as pro-integration militias laid waste to the
territory, slaughtered innocent people and forced
thousands of East Timorese into West Timor.
Relative calm and stability has been restored in
most of East Timor, and we remember here today the
sacrifices made by peacekeepers from Australia,
Bangladesh, Nepal and my own country who in recent
24

months laid down their lives to help achieve this. But
the militias continue to hold sway in the border areas
among the refugees in West Timor. Unless brought
under control, these militias will destabilize both West
and East Timor.
The murder last week of three United Nations
humanitarian workers in Atambua in West Timor
repelled us all. New Zealand was able to respond
quickly, along with Australia, to the United Nations
call for help in evacuating their colleagues and non-
governmental organization personnel from Atambua.
We committed helicopters with security and medical
elements from our forces serving on the border with the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET). This airborne evacuation, which had
the cooperation of Indonesian forces, was successful.
But the pain and the outrage we feel at the murder of
three United Nations humanitarian workers remains
undiminished.
The Security Council, in its resolution 1319
(2000), insisted that the Government of Indonesia
disarm and disband the militia immediately to ensure
safety and security in the refugee camps and for
humanitarian workers, and to prevent cross-border
incursions into East Timor. It also called for those who
have carried out attacks on international personnel to
be brought to justice. These are binding obligations.
The world awaits action to implement them without
further delay.
Besides East Timor, New Zealand is at present
contributing to 12 other peacekeeping operations,
including in Kosovo, on the borders of Syria, Israel and
Lebanon, in the Prevlaka peninsula and in Sierra
Leone. New Zealand personnel also serve with the
Peace Monitoring Group in Bougainville, the
Multinational Force Organization (MFO) in Sinai and
with the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Being
conscious of the many challenges faced by the United
Nations in meeting its peacekeeping responsibilities,
we greatly welcome the Brahimi report. We trust that
the report's important recommendations will receive
serious and expeditious consideration during this
Millennium Assembly session, with a view to their
early implementation.
As the Brahimi report points out, weak mandates
and poor resourcing underlie most of those operations
which did not succeed in their objectives. We are
concerned too at the tendency to rely overly on
“coalitions of the willing” to carry out operations that
should be undertaken by the United Nations. The
failure of some Member States to pay their assessed
contributions on time, in full and without conditions
imposes an impossible burden on the Organization and
on troop contributors. We agree that the scale of
assessments for peacekeeping needs revision to make it
more equitable and transparent. Any revision must be
established in accordance with the longstanding
principle of apportioning expenses according to
Member States' capacity to pay.
Heads of State or Government agreed at the
Millennium Summit to intensify their efforts to achieve
a comprehensive reform of the Security Council in all
its aspects. In the past seven years of debate on this
matter, it has been shown just how difficult an issue it
is, especially in regard to how the Council might be
enlarged. There is no agreement on this aspect at this
time. And yet I am sure that most Member States
would agree that the Council must be made more
representative of today's membership as well as more
transparent in its working methods and more
democratic in its decision-making. If there is to be
progress towards an overall package deal on reform,
then compromises will have to be made.
At the heart of any reform, in New Zealand's
view, must be the curtailment of the veto, if indeed it
cannot be eliminated. We have argued this case since
1945, and we believe that it is even more relevant
today. A device which 50 years ago might have had the
utility of preventing the permanent members from
using the Organization to make war on one another has
in recent times served to frustrate the will of the wider
membership. I believe there is very broad agreement in
the General Assembly on the need to deal with the veto
urgently, so that the Security Council can be more
effective in carrying out its important responsibilities.
I would not want to suggest that there has been no
progress at all on Council reform. There have, in fact,
been some major steps forward in opening up the
Council's meetings and briefings to participation by
non-members. We are grateful for that. I would also
like to reaffirm New Zealand's strong support for the
Open-ended Working Group on Security Council
reform, whose deliberations have contributed to this
progress. In our view, the Working Group continues to
be the appropriate forum in which to pursue efforts
aimed at reforming the Council, because it is essential
for the health of the Organization that any reform
25

package enjoy the widest support and buy-in. Council
reform is too important a matter for back-room deals.
The Millennium Declaration contains some
important guidance on human rights, democracy and
good governance. For example, all countries are
enjoined to strengthen their capacity to implement the
principles and practices of democracy and respect for
human rights, including minority rights. This could not
be more timely for my own region, the South Pacific,
where over the past year we have seen the collapse of
democracy and governance in some countries in the
face of disputes over land and economic disparities and
as a result of ethnic tensions.
There are no easy solutions to some of the
problems the region faces, but one thing is clear, and
that is that the answer to these problems is not to adopt
political systems that discriminate against particular
ethnic groups, as some in Fiji this year have sought to
do. To do so simply breeds a deeper sense of frustration
and exclusion, which is a recipe for further instability.
Small States, especially small developing countries like
our neighbours in the Pacific, face particular challenges
from globalization. They are uniquely vulnerable to
external impacts. We need to find fresh and more
effective means to development.
It is essential to help countries build for
themselves inclusive and democratic forms of
government that in turn take account of cultural values.
Underpinning this must be robust and accountable
institutions, respect for the rule of law, independence
of the judiciary, an effective press, strong civil society
and, above all, greater public education to foster a
more widespread understanding of democratic values
and processes.
The Millennium Summit provided heads of State
or Government the opportunity to take action on a
range of treaties which are fundamental to the
development of international human rights law and
international humanitarian law. My Prime Minister
took action in respect of six, and I record here in
particular New Zealand's ratification of the Optional
Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Rome
Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the two
Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of
the Child.
The practices of child prostitution, child
pornography and the appalling exploitation of children
to fight wars are a disgrace and a crime against
humanity which must be expunged. We encourage
others also to sign and ratify these agreements. I should
also add that we greatly welcome the recent decision
by the Economic and Social Council to establish a
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.
At the Millennium Summit, world leaders agreed
to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass
destruction, particularly nuclear weapons. The outcome
of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in
May, where the five nuclear-weapon States gave an
unequivocal political undertaking to accomplish the
total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, demonstrates
a new determination to achieve a world free of nuclear
weapons. This is a matter of real urgency. We must
promote the implementation of the new commitments.
New Zealand, with its new agenda partners, will submit
a draft resolution during this session of the General
Assembly.
New Zealand will also, in partnership with Brazil,
promote a southern hemisphere free of nuclear
weapons. In addition, we will, along with Australia,
Mexico and Japan, urge all countries that have yet to
do so to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-
Test-Ban Treaty. We will also support further
preparations for the United Nations Conference on the
Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All
Its Aspects and join calls for adherence to the Ottawa
Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,
Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and
on Their Destruction.
New Zealand urges caution regarding decisions
on missile developments that could impact negatively
on nuclear disarmament, lead to a new nuclear arms
race or be inconsistent with the commitment to the
total elimination of nuclear weapons. This is no time
for complacency. The United Nations disarmament and
arms-control machinery must engage again in
negotiations and other work on the new programme of
action agreed at the NPT Conference.
Leaders also declared their resolve to minimize
the adverse effects of United Nations economic
sanctions on innocent populations. Sanctions are an
important tool at the Security Council's disposal to
encourage compliance with its resolutions, but they
must be appropriately targeted for maximum effect.
They should not impose blanket measures which harm
26

innocent populations and even strengthen the grip of
despotic regimes. We support efforts within the
Organization to develop proposals for smarter, more
effective sanctions which apply pressure where it we
will have maximum impact.
The Millennium Declaration also speaks of the
need to protect our common environment. My Prime
Minister announced during the Summit our intention to
become party to the Kyoto Protocol to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by
mid-2002. I also wish to recall a particular
achievement over the past year in the holding of the
inaugural session of the United Nations Open-ended
Informal Consultative Process on Ocean Affairs and
the law of the sea. This is a significant step forward in
providing an appropriate forum for discussion of cross-
cutting oceans issues. The success of this process
should be judged by the extent to which there is
enhanced global understanding of oceans issues and an
increased willingness to cooperate and coordinate
cross-sectorally to address them.
Finally, the Millennium Declaration sets some
key goals for development and poverty eradication and
urges meeting the special needs of Africa. This year,
New Zealand was able to increase its core funding of
the United Nations Development Programme by more
than a third and of the United Nations Children's Fund
by almost a half. We believe that the United Nations
has a key role to play in the coordination of official
development assistance delivery. The preparations for
the event on financing for development are an excellent
demonstration of leadership by the Organization and a
significant step forward in furthering cooperation with
the Bretton Woods institutions. The crushing and
seemingly never-ending debt burden, especially on the
countries of Africa, must be urgently reduced. We must
also address more effectively the scourge of
HIV/AIDS.
Leaders at last week's Summit provided this
Millennium Assembly with a clear direction and a
strong mandate. Our countries have delegated us the
responsibility to realize that vision of a better world
and we must ensure through our efforts and
determination that we do not fail them."
6078,55,2000,MHL,"I would like first
of all to congratulate the President, on his assumption
of the office of President of the fifty-fifth session of the
United Nations General Assembly. I wish him every
success in this difficult and inspiring task. I would also
like to express my sincere appreciation to his
predecessor, Mr. Theo-Ben Gurirab, for his exceptional
leadership during the fifty-fourth session.
Allow me to include in this tribute the SecretaryGeneral for his efforts and crucial role in maintaining
and promoting the role of this Organization, and for his
inspiration in strengthening its effectiveness and
credibility with respect to peace, security, justice and
development in the world.
I wish to add a few comments to the statement
made earlier by the representative of the Federated
States of Micronesia on behalf of the Pacific Islands
Forum countries.
Let us pause for a moment to recognize the
contribution of the founding fathers and framers of the
United Nations and its Charter. They produced a
document which, in large measure, has contributed to
an ever-increasing consciousness of the prerequisites
necessary for world peace. Today we should celebrate
the existence of the United Nations and its
accomplishments, both of which offer us the
opportunity to reflect on how collectively we can better
chart our path and articulate our goals more clearly for
the next millennium. President Kessai Note's address
to the Millennium Summit reaffirmed the adherence
and commitment of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands to the principles enshrined in the Charter for
the collective good of all people.
I take great pleasure in reiterating the Marshall
Islands' warm welcome to the Government and peoples
of Tuvalu, as the 189th Member of this Organization.
Indeed, the admission of new Member States adds to
the legitimacy of the United Nations.
On the other hand, the denial of membership in
this Organization to the 23 million people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan, who have made a
significant and meaningful contribution to international
development, is contrary not only to the true spirit of
the United Nations Charter, but also to its principle of
universality and to the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. We must strengthen the vital role of the
Organization in achieving the goals of conflict
prevention, maintenance of peace, regional stability,
promotion of fundamental human rights and
development of democracy and international progress,
and in fulfilling the aspirations of peoples to selfdetermination and engagement, because the United
Nations is the only Organization that can bring that
shining light to those 23 million people. Furthermore,
the United Nations is the only forum for Member
States to build mutual trust and to resolve issues
through peaceful dialogue. The guiding principles of
democracy, respect for human rights and the right of
peoples to self-determination must, in conformity with
the principles of justice and international law, continue
to underpin our collective aspirations. This will require
our concerted action in this new millennium.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands applauds
and commends the unprecedented efforts made by the
leaders of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea
and the Republic of Korea, who have engaged in a
dialogue that may help chart a course towards lasting
peace in that peninsula. I wish to state also that the
Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
encourages the leaders of Israel and Palestine to seize
the historic opportunity that is within reach to
peacefully conclude a framework agreement towards
lasting peace in the Middle East. I wish to commend
the efforts of the United States of America in this
regard.
The immutable law of change makes it necessary
for the United Nations to continue to critically examine
its performance and structures in search of practical
and timely solutions. This it must certainly do, because
38

the current political landscape is vastly different from
the one that prevailed 50 years ago. It is characterized
by a more than threefold increase in the number of
nations with membership in the United Nations, and by
a heightened spirit of generosity and desire on the part
of civil society and corporations to become more active
players in the process of change. It is imperative,
therefore, that those elements and structures which are
antiquated, those which have ceased to promote the
welfare of nations and those which no longer minister
to the needs of a continually changing humanity be
swept away and relegated to the pages of history.
A more comprehensive review and restructuring
of the Security Council, in line with the spirit of
achieving a broader base for decision-making through
consensus and confidence-building, is clearly long
overdue. Other critical issues in the reform process
deserve further examination, with a view to restoring
that body's dignity and legitimacy and strengthening
the confidence and trust of the international
community. Enlarging both the permanent and nonpermanent categories while ensuring an equitable
geographical distribution seems to be the way forward.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands remains
committed to supporting the efforts by the SecretaryGeneral and others to reform and streamline the
mandates and activities of the United Nations and its
other organizations and agencies. While the
peacekeeping and general fund scales seem to be
outdated, the process of reform must take seriously into
account the limited responsibility and capacity of small
island developing States such as the Marshall Islands to
sustain their obligation in both categories. Also, now
that this Organization stands at 189 Member States, 14
of them from the Pacific Region, the reconfiguration of
our electoral grouping should be an additional matter to
be placed on the table. It may be a complex one, but
through our collective inspiration it can be an
achievable goal, to be considered without further delay.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands is keen to
further develop its ongoing active role and cooperation
with the United Nations specialized agencies and
programmes. In the view of the Marshall Islands, those
bodies' efforts to make their operational activities more
effective and responsive to the special needs of small
island developing States will undoubtedly play a key
role in the new millennium. The expansion of the
Resident Coordinator programme — which brings it
closer to home, where it belongs — is a case in point.
While the human rights achievements recorded in
the 50 years since the proclamation of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights must be acknowledged,
there is a sense that much remains to be done before
the world can truly claim that the Declaration has
become a common standard of achievement. The
Millennium Summit is a significant acknowledgement
of the need for all States to work together, in a spirit of
unity and cooperation, to ensure that the fruits of
global development are shared and made more
equitable and just for the benefit of humanity at large.
Within the mandate of its Charter to promote
economic and social progress, peace and security, and
sustainable development and prosperity, the United
Nations is the only fully representative Organization
capable of harmonizing our collective aspirations for a
peaceful, stable and prosperous global village. The
Republic of the Marshall Islands endorses SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan's report, “We the peoples: the role
of the United Nations in the twenty-first century”.
At the turn of the century, achievements have
been realized, and this trend should be encouraged. Yet
we are living under many threats. Acts of terrorism do
not recognize national boundaries, and infectious
diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis
are poised to spread quickly throughout the world. Our
decisive and collective response is therefore more than
ever required. In many developing countries, poverty
and the deprivation of basic human rights, especially as
concerns women and children, seem directly linked to,
and escalate, crime.
We must also strive to eliminate weapons of mass
destruction, especially nuclear weapons. The
universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a major concern.
Trafficking in drugs and small arms represents a
considerable challenge and a major threat for small
islands such as the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
because of its geographic isolation and the fact that it
lacks the required resources and capability to combat
these phenomena. Our collective effort towards the
creation of an effective global response to address all
of these threats is urgently required.
We realize that global environmental degradation
is of our own creation. The issue of global warming is
a real threat to all, particularly to the Marshall Islands
and to all small island developing States. There is no
39

doubt that the survival of populations and cultures is at
stake.
The Marshall Islands has already lost metres of
usable and habitable land due to climate change and
sea-level rise, and the rate of loss is increasing. This is
a matter of life and death. Implementing the legally
binding commitments agreed in the Kyoto Protocol is
the only significant step forward on the path of
ensuring effective global action to combat climate
change. There will be a terrible tragedy unless there is
international cooperation. How will displaced
populations — whatever the reasons for their being
displaced — be able to enjoy and sustain their basic
human rights for generations to come? Will their
cultures and livelihoods be able to survive for the
benefit of future generations?
Education and health are of paramount
importance to every country in the world. Education is
the key to the progress of any nation. We must
collectively strive to ensure that an educated
population makes up a healthy and prosperous society.
I am pleased to report that the Government of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands has taken some bold
steps, by allocating the greatest amount of its limited
resources towards the improvement of its education
and health systems. I take this opportunity to appeal for
the interest and support of the international community
in joining us in this endeavour. I am particularly
pleased to convey the deep appreciation of the
Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to
the Government of Italy for its generous support for
our efforts to implement the Barbados Programme of
Action. The first phase of the Marshall Islands solar
energy project would not have been implemented
without its support, through the United Nations Trust
Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The
interest in and support of the international community
for the implementation of the other phases of the
project would be highly appreciated.
The Marshall Islands National Nutrition and
Children's Council has been very active since its
inception. In addition to establishing task forces on
food and nutrition, suicide prevention, substance abuse,
neglect and disability, it made another significant
contribution with the agriculture, food and nutrition
policy, as the Marshall Islands strives to meet its
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. Existing policies specifically aimed at the rights
of the child are under review as we consider making
the Convention a part of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands legal system. A representative Commission on
Sustainable Development has been established with the
mandate of ensuring that the Barbados Programme of
Action is implemented in all its aspects. Other
legislation to curb illegal financial transactions will
soon be introduced in the Parliament's current session.
These are some of the efforts being made by the
Republic of the Marshall Islands as it strives to meet its
treaty obligations and enhance the life of every citizen
of the country. We cannot do it alone, and we appeal
once again to the international community for support.
Let us have a United Nations that will meet the
challenges of the twenty-first century.




"
6162,55,2000,PNG,"On
behalf of the people and Government of Papua New
Guinea, I join previous speakers in congratulating you,
Sir, on your election to your prestigious post. Your
unanimous election as President of the General
Assembly at the dawn of the new millennium shows
the high esteem in which the international community
holds both you personally and your country, Finland.
We are confident that you will guide the historic fifty-
fifth session to a successful conclusion.
The skill with which your predecessor, Mr. Theo-
Ben Gurirab of Namibia, cooperated to develop the
theme of the recent Millennium Summit, and presided
over the drafting of the outcome document and ensured
the smooth management of the Summit earned our
sincere appreciation for a job very well done. We also
congratulate him on his very positive contribution to
our collective deliberations during the previous year.
May I also take this opportunity, through you, Sir,
to heartily congratulate the heads of State of both
Finland and Namibia on their magnanimous
stewardship and successful conclusion of the recent
unprecedented large assembly of approximately 150
heads of State and Government in New York, which
paved the way for the pursuit of our common vision
and security into the twenty-first century.
Beyond the millennium celebrations, this is a
time for reflection and looking ahead. The Millennium
Summit took place on the eve of the twenty-fifth
anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. The
same anniversary also marks the first quarter century of
my country's membership of the United Nations. It is
therefore an apt occasion both for reflecting on
experience and for looking ahead.
My particular focus is on the changing character
of, need for and potential for international cooperation.
The conjunction of the millennium with Papua New
Guinea's silver anniversary invites us to take a number
of different time perspectives: the short, medium and
long terms. For those of us who have been privileged to
play an active part in public life during this period, it
also provides the opportunity to compare the ambitions
we had 25 years ago with the challenges we face now.
As the Secretary-General recently reminded us in
the very title of the document (A/54/2000) he prepared
to guide and stimulate the Millennium Summit, the
United Nations was formed in the name and with the
objective of furthering the common purposes of “We
the peoples of the United Nations”. In similar fashion,
the Constitution that came into effect when my country
became independent was made and adopted in the
name of “We the people of Papua New Guinea”.
2

As someone who had the honour of participating
in making the Papua New Guinea Constitution, I am
very mindful of the national goals and directive
principles we set for ourselves at independence. While
some have a distinctively national character — such as
preserving, developing and building on Papua New
Guinean ways — others resemble challenges that the
United Nations faces today. They include such
universal challenges as promoting integral human
development, equity and participation, and sustainable
use of natural resources and the environment. They
also include the challenge of maintaining,
strengthening and making mutually beneficial use of
national sovereignty and self-reliance.
But look at us now. What have we achieved?
What remains to be done? The most striking feature of
contemporary Papua New Guinea is the way in which
we have had to trim our objectives. Our situation is,
obviously, not unique, but it certainly warrants the
most careful consideration.
When the present Government, led by the Prime
Minister, The Honourable Sir Mekere Morauta, came to
office in the middle of last year, we set ourselves five
very carefully defined objectives: to restore integrity to
State institutions; to stabilize our national currency —
the kina — and the national budget; to remove
obstacles to investment and growth; and to continue the
process of working for lasting peace in Bougainville by
peaceful means.
The national goals and directive principles
continue to guide our long-term ambitions and plans.
But experience and the realities of governance in the
age of globalization have required us to focus on much
more specific, short- and medium-term objectives. We
cannot blame others — or even such largely impersonal
processes as economic and technological
globalization — for every aspect of our current
situation. Much of the responsibility lies with leaders
and institutions at home. Both fortunately and
unfortunately, it is part of the human condition at the
start of the twenty-first century that we are not on our
own. Despite important differences in origins,
processes and outcomes, our situation is not unique.
Many other developing countries face similar
challenges in the short and medium terms.
International cooperation is an important key to
collective self-help, both between countries with
similar weaknesses and strengths, and between
countries that are different and complementary —
especially rich and poor.
As regards global cooperation, as a member of
the global community Papua New Guinea is able to
draw on support from the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, our
development cooperation partners in Europe, and the
Asia-Pacific countries that have formed themselves
into the Friends of Papua New Guinea.
While my delegation has come to New York to
discuss global issues and explore the potential for
global cooperation, Papua New Guinea also
participates in various forms of regional, interregional
and bilateral cooperation. Papua New Guinea
recognizes the value of, and is firmly committed to
further strengthening, global cooperation through
bodies like the World Trade Organization (WTO).
My Government is disappointed that the next
round of World Trade Organization (WTO)
negotiations has been delayed, and calls for them to be
held at the earliest possible opportunity.
As one of the countries where increasing areas of
land are already becoming unusable or actually
disappearing as a result of rising sea-levels caused by
climate change, we believe in the urgent need for full
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.
On an issue where the very survival of certain
members of the global community is clearly at stake —
and where global security depends on coordinated
global action — there must be no backsliding, no
compromises, and no special cases allowed because of
inability or unwillingness to honour global agreements
for whatever reason.
Papua New Guinea is pleased to welcome our
close island neighbours and very good friends from
Tuvalu to membership of the United Nations.
What a terrible tragedy it would be if the
international community were to fail them at the very
time when they, together with other small island
States — including countries which joined the United
Nations last year — are assuming the responsibilities
which go with becoming full participants in the
Organization's affairs.
Certain security issues, such as climate change,
require a global approach. So do efforts to limit the
3

proliferation that would bring about the complete
elimination of nuclear weapons.
Global cooperation is the only means by which
the international community can realistically hope to
achieve the objective which the Secretary-General set
for the Millennium Summit of ensuring that
globalization becomes a positive force for people,
instead of leaving them behind in squalor, especially in
developing countries.
However, as the Secretary-General also suggested
in his report (A/54/1) to the fifty-fourth session of the
General Assembly, different regions have different
problems. Even similar problems in different settings
may require different approaches. Security policies that
work in one region may not work in others. The road to
success can require complementary national, regional
and global efforts.
Thus, Papua New Guinea is addressing the
unwelcome spread of small arms and light weapons by
imposing a complete ban on the issuance of new gun
licenses. We support efforts to deal with the spread of
illegally obtained or held arms through the Pacific
Islands Forum.
We look to the forthcoming United Nations
Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and
Light Weapons in All Its Aspects to provide a global
framework and global support for the efforts that
individual States and regional organizations are taking
to deal with the problem within their respective
jurisdictions.
When it comes to the management of ocean
resources, Papua New Guinea sees regional and
interregional cooperation as complementary to
measures designed to ensure the sustainable harvesting
of fish in national waters.
We therefore welcome the agreement recently
concluded under the auspices of the Multilateral High-
level Conference on fisheries with the purpose of
ensuring sustainable fishing for tuna and highly
migratory species throughout their ranges in the
Western and Central Pacific.
Papua New Guinea would also like to see both
broader and deeper cooperation between coastal States
in other aspects of oceans and ocean-bed management,
including deep-sea mining.
In terms of regional cooperation, such
cooperation is indispensable to dealing successfully
with many important global and national issues. But
regional cooperation can itself have a variety of
different dimensions and employ different means.
In the South Pacific, for example, two of our
closest neighbours, Fiji and Solomon Islands, are
experiencing internal difficulties that have given rise to
serious concern on the part of their friends.
We do not condone the illegal overthrow of
democratic and constitutional Governments or other
threats to the security of the Governments and citizens
of other States, but, regrettably, and despite repeated
efforts by previous Papua New Guinea Governments
and other States, the main intra-regional body engaged
in promoting regional cooperation in the South Pacific,
the Pacific Islands Forum, does not have a mechanism
for dealing promptly and effectively with challenges to
the security of States in the region.
It has, therefore, been unable to arrange
consultations, let alone facilitate a coordinated
approach  to the situations which have arisen following
armed challenges to the Governments of Fiji and
Solomon Islands. Some of our neighbours have
responded by looking for support outside the region.
With the recent addition of six additional Pacific
members to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
group of States party to the Lome Convention, 14
Pacific island States now have access to a very
practical mechanism for dealing with such situations.
The upshot is that, when Ministers and
Ambassadors from Pacific ACP member States met in
Cotonou, Benin, in June for the signing of the new
framework agreement between the ACP and the
European Union, we decided to set up a ministerial
mission to report on the situations in Fiji and Solomon
Islands.
In doing so, we were mindful of the need for, and
grateful for the support of, the European Union.
The offer made by the French Minister for
Economic Cooperation at the regional forum of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to
ensure that the European Commission would defer
making a final decision on sanctions until the Pacific
ACP Ministerial Mission had reported was especially
welcome because of the meaning and support it gave to
our effort at regional cooperation.
4

The imposition of sanctions against a country can
be a very blunt instrument indeed, causing innocent
and powerless people to suffer at the same time as the
powerful and influential, and sometimes
disadvantaging them even more. Even so-called smart
sanctions can have wide, unintended effects while
leaving their objects largely unaffected.
When a small group of armed men try to take
over a Government, imposing sanctions that affect
innocent men, women and children can be not only
ineffective but even counter-productive.
Sanctions might leave armed youths unaffected
and in a position where they are even unable to
appreciate, or are indifferent to, the wider
consequences of their actions.
The underlying causes of inter-group tensions in
Solomon Islands and the events which followed the
attempted civilian armed coup in Fiji could be difficult
to identify, and are beyond influence by sanctions.
It is, therefore, vital that serious difficulties such
as those currently affecting Fiji and Solomon Islands
be properly studied and carefully addressed.
Sometimes, the people best equipped to
understand such situations and identify underlying
causes are neighbours with similar cultures or other
shared values.
In terms of the ACP Ministerial Mission, at the
request of other Pacific ACP States, I have recently had
the honour of leading the Pacific ACP Ministerial
Mission to Fiji and Solomon Islands.
My colleagues included the Ministers for Foreign
Affairs from Cook Islands, Mr. Robert Woonton, and
Vanuatu, the Honourable Serge Vohor, as well as the
Minister for Education from Samoa, the Honourable
Fiame Naomi Mata'afa.
With the active support of the Governments of
both countries, we followed a crowded itinerary of
meetings with the Prime Ministers, ministers and
officials in Fiji and Solomon Islands, members of the
previous Governments of both countries and business
and trade union leaders, as well as a wide cross-section
of other elements of civil society, including women's
organizations. We were also able to interview victims
in towns and rural areas, and to examine instances of
destruction at first hand.
My colleagues and I are currently working on our
report. We expect to present it to the European
Commission, the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and other
ACP, EU and joint bodies in October.
The commitment made by the French Minister for
Economic Cooperation, whose country currently holds
the presidency of the EU, means that the region — or,
at least, our report — has been given the opportunity to
influence events. The process on which we have
embarked is, therefore, more meaningful than any
existing alternative. We, the Pacific ACP members,
offered to share our report with the Pacific Islands
Forum, and the support our initiative has received from
the region reflects our commitment to wider
cooperation, not to mention our unwillingness to
become involved in even the appearance of
competition between rival regional bodies or groups.
The initiative has been welcomed and praised,
both in the region and further afield. It sets an example
which is worthy of close study both for the precedents
it sets for cooperation among Pacific ACP States and as
a possible model for similar efforts in other regions.
With regard to the Bougainville situation, Fiji and
Solomon Islands are not the first States in our region to
experience serious internal difficulties, though we pray
not only that there will be real improvement very soon
but that they will be the last States to experience such
difficulties.
After more than eight years of armed conflict —
from 1989 to 1997 — the part of Papua New Guinea
known as Bougainville is now at peace. The
progressive political settlement is moving ahead. The
Lincoln Agreement on Peace, Security and
Development on Bougainville commits the parties to
peace-building on several levels, from weapons
disposal and the re-establishment of civil authority,
through reconciliation among former combatants to
reconstruction of infrastructure, restoration of services,
economic and social recovery and early resumption of
the kinds of development which are part of the return
of normalcy.
The national Government is committed to such a
multidimensional approach. It is the way by which we
hope to cooperate in building for a lasting peace by
peaceful means. The priority which the Prime Minister
gave the Bougainville peace process more than 12
months ago remains in place. Evidence of its
continuing significance can be seen in the initiative he
5

has recently taken to meet key Bougainvillean demands
within the framework of the Papua New Guinea
Constitution.
The Government, which took the initiative in
inviting our neighbours, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand
and Vanuatu, to set up the neutral, regional Peace
Monitoring Group (PMG), values the contribution its
unarmed personnel make to promoting mutual
confidence on the ground. The PMG's success can be
judged from the peaceful way in which it is now
beginning to disengage by substantially reducing its
size. The process needs greater support from the
Bougainvillean parties so as to avoid the vacuum which
has followed the departure of similar peacekeeping
operations elsewhere, by cooperating in the re-
establishment of policing, courts and correctional
institutional services, as well as by strengthening the
institutions at community level that help to maintain
public order, dispense justice and uphold the rule of
law.
As the initiator of the request for the United
Nations observer mission in Bougainville, and as its
host, Papua New Guinea appreciates the support which
the Security Council and other organs of the United
Nations provide for the Bougainville peace process. We
are determined to keep on working for lasting peace by
peaceful means within a flexible framework which will
allow Bougainville a high degree of autonomy
consistent with the integrity, security and sovereignty
of the nation.
With regard to social and economic issues, as a
developing country with 25 years of independence,
Papua New Guinea is experiencing very great difficulty
in improving national performance as measured by
human development indicators. In some areas, our
record is actually becoming worse. The current
Government's five main objectives are intended to
focus attention and effort where they are most needed.
Our determination to pursue them is already making a
very real difference, especially as far as economic
management and the delivery of Government services
are concerned.
Structural adjustment, including quite
fundamental public sector reform, is one of the key
means of bringing about often long-overdue change.
We need the continuing support of our economic
partners to succeed, including access to markets;
increased investment in priority areas, such as
downstream processing, which provides increased
opportunities for productive employment; and aid on
concessional terms. The recently concluded partnership
agreement between the ACP countries and the EU is an
example worthy of much wider emulation.
As a developing country that achieved
independence only a quarter of a century ago, Papua
New Guinea is firmly committed to the proper
preparation for orderly decolonization. Impressed with
the progress being made to implement the Noumea
Accord, we continue to believe very strongly that the
rights of the indigenous Kanaks of New Caledonia
must be respected. Conscious of the consequences of
other forms of decolonization, we welcome the re-
emergence of East Timor as an independent entity. We
look forward to receiving a delegation later this year to
discuss how we might develop technical and other
forms of mutually beneficial South-South cooperation.
Meanwhile, even as we continue to deepen and
broaden cooperation with other Pacific island
countries, we respect the integrity of our other
neighbours and continue to benefit from the exchanges
which flow from our status as a special observer at
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
meetings. In the broader arena of Asia-Pacific
cooperation, we value our membership of the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum and
continue to work towards honouring the reciprocal
commitments APEC members have made to liberalize
markets. APEC includes some of our closest bilateral
partners and friends. Common membership, and the
process of developing economic ties with other APEC
economies, do not detract from other aspects of Papua
New Guinea's foreign relations. They do not affect the
commitments we have made to such good friends as the
People's Republic of China. We will not allow them to
do so.
In conclusion, I should like to say that, 25 years
after independence, Papua New Guinea has one of the
longest unbroken records of constitutional and
democratic government among countries that have
become independent in the last 50 or so years. We have
experienced difficulties, and had some near misses.
The stresses and strains which have affected our system
of Government have tested our strengths. In doing so,
they have increased our understanding of countries
experiencing serious internal difficulties — although
not our sympathy for those who deliberately violate
democratic principles or established constitutional
6

practices — while reinforcing our commitment to good
governance, both at home and abroad.
Apart from the obvious consequences that this
commitment has for Papua New Guinea's response to
countries experiencing serious internal difficulties,
including our preference for a positive, forward-
looking approach and not negative sanctions, it also
underlies our support for United Nations reform.
The reform must extend from improving
administrative performance to making the Security
Council more representative of United Nations
Members as a whole. It must, in fact, extend to the
performance of United Nations Members themselves,
especially when it comes to paying their dues in a
timely way and in full.
The millennium marks an important turning point
in the calendar, and, because of my country's silver
anniversary, in Papua New Guinea's history too. The
United Nations is also at a critical turning point, with
the Secretary-General drawing members' attention
back to the original basis and focus among the people
the Organization should serve.
The recent review of United Nations peace and
security activities has produced an excellent report
which challenges us to turn another corner and ensure
that the increased responsibilities which the
Organization has assumed since the end of the cold war
help to keep and build peace in very different
conditions.
I conclude by paying tribute to the vision which
participants in the Millennium Summit have expressed
on our behalf. In doing so, let me add that the real
challenge we face is, emphatically, not to make more
speeches, but to turn their wise words into practical
forms of cooperation which help us achieve common
purposes without sacrificing the diversity which is the
basis of our need and ability to engage in global self-
help."
6194,47,1992,VUT," I join in 
the congratulations extended to you. Sir, on your election as President of the 
General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election symbolizes the 
great changes taking place throughout the world, and is a tribute to your 
country and to your people, as well as to you yourself. 

I should also like to pay a special tribute to you your predecessor, 
Mr. Samir Shihabi, the former Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia, for 
the manner in which he presided over the affairs of the General Assembly 
during its forty-sixth session. 
There can be no doubt that there has been no period in our lifetime when 
the world has enjoyed greater hope for a lasting international peace than it 
does now. The gradual reduction of tension and the eventual elimination of 
antagonisms between the world's two foremost military Powers have had dramatic 
results in nuclear disarmament, and ultimately contributed to the end of the 
cold war. Today, the widening circle of democracy holds out the promise of an 
international environment that could become even more conducive to the 
attainment of international peace and security. 
None the less, many problems persist and plague the Earth, threatening 
our never-ending search for justice, equality and peace. Democracy, so 
cherished and championed, within certain national borders, is often less 
cherished, if not disregarded, when it comes to the interests of the large and 
powerful countries, on the one hand, and those of the smaller and economically 
weaker States, on the other. 
Moreover, nationalism, which could, and should, be a progressive vehicle 
for unifying peoples, rather than dividing them, has on occasion been 
encouraged to manifest its narrowest and most intolerant forms. In too many 
parts of the world, old ethnic antagonisms have been reawakened and are being 
exploited by demagogues who are very adept at using these antagonisms to serve 
their selfish and short-sighted ambitions. Unfortunately, far too often the 
victims of this demagoguery have no recourse to any legal mechanism that might 
spare their lives and end their suffering. 

Tragically, we have seen certain scenarios played out far too often. At 
first, the world sits idly by and barely notices the insulting words and the 
offensive speeches that are made. Then, even more inflammatory rhetoric is 
spouted, and eventually stones are hurled. Next, individuals are assaulted in 
the streets and their homes are invaded and vandalized. Before too long, 
conditions deteriorate irreparably. 
For some, that constitutes a point of no return. Ignorance, which breeds 
hatred, accelerates and races forward unchecked, building its own momentum 
with ever-increasing destructive force. Entire neighbourhoods or villages are 
placed under siege. The demagogues, by now totally intoxicated by the false 
power of the forces they have unleashed, will always try to claim to be 
defending the loftiest ideals. In fact, they are simply following their 
basest instincts. 
Vanuatu has long been disturbed by the hesitancy and reluctance of some 
members of the international community to address this very troublesome 
issue. In the past we have warned that failure to examine the causes of 
ethnic antagonisms or intercommunal conflicts, failure to devise peaceful ways 
to resolve them, could only lead to a situation in which, one day, 
international peace and security would be quite seriously threatened by such 
developments. Regrettably, that day has now arrived. Thus, while some of us 
have never had more reason to rejoice and others have never had more reason to 
mourn, still others have never faced a less certain future. 
What possible joy can a mother in the Balkans feel when she buries her 
young son whose life was ended by an unknown sniper's bullet? What possible 

joy can a father in Somalia feel when he watches his daughter die a slow and 
painful death from starvation? What can possibly ease the terror that fills 
the hearts of defenceless and innocent refugees who find themselves caught in 
the vice of political and social indifference or who behold the chaos in 
native lands they had always considered havens of justice and equality. 
While some rightly rejoice over the end of the cold war and the spread of 
democracy, others are homeless and continue to suffer the pangs of hunger 
often the result of economic deprivation. Still others mourn the sudden and 
violent end of the lives of their loved ones and wonder anxiously whether they 
themselves will survive to see the next sunrise. While some are able to 
applaud what has been achieved, others can only contemplate the long road 
still to be travelled. 

From South Africa to Afghanistan, from Cambodia to Haiti, from Bosnia and 
Herzegovina to East Timor, from the heart of Europe all the way to the sunny 
South Pacific, people are suffering some for a long time now because of 
the difficulties of all kinds that they face, and the international community 
must still shoulder the major responsibility. 
All these ideas are emphasized in the Secretary-General's remarkable 
report entitled 'An Agenda for Peace'. He has made a thought-provoking 
analysis, and we find this document to be a very good starting-point for 
much-needed discussions as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United 
Nations and as mankind prepares to enter the twenty-first century. 
The international political environment is not the only environment that 
concerns us. Much has been written and much has been said about the Earth 
Summit held this past June in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It remains to be seen 
what will be done as a follow-up to that very important meeting. 
We are pleased to note that some very positive measures have already been 
taken. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is to be commended for 
having made a significant financial contribution to Capacity 21. Canada has 
indicated that it will follow suit. We trust that others also will do so very 
soon. This important initiative will help the developing countries formulate 
national policies and legislation in support of the environment and 
sustainable development. It will focus on the technical training of human 
resources and the strengthening of regional and national institutions. More 
importantly, it will show how serious the developed countries of the North are 
about the extensive multilateral commitments necessary to breathe life into 
our post-Rio journey. 

At this session of the General Assembly a number of important measures 
should be taken as follow-ups to the Earth Summit. Among these, of course, is 
the establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development. It 
is our hope that the commission's secretariat will be situated at United 
Nations Headquarters here in New York and that the commission will meet in New 
York so that all countries will have an opportunity to participate in, and 
contribute to, the commission's important work. Situating the commission's 
secretariat elsewhere and holding its meetings outside New York would without 
any doubt result in sharply reduced participation by a large number of 
developing countries and would limit the commission's effectiveness. 
Furthermore, we feel that situating the commission in New York would be most 
cost-effective for the United Nations and would stimulate the very necessary 
interaction between the commission, UNDP, the United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA), the World Bank and the other multilateral agencies that are so 
essential to making the follow-up to Rio meaningful and effective. 
We strongly believe, as do our colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island 
States (AOSIS), that the decisions made with respect to the site of the 
commission's secretariat, the venue of its meetings, its size and its 
composition will be critical in determining whether there will be universal 
participation and transparency in the work of the commission. Our major 
concern is that this matter not be decided on any ground except what is likely 
to lead to the most effective functioning of the commission and its productive 
interaction with other agencies. 

During the current session of the General Assembly, an intergovernmental 
committee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification will also 
be established. Vanuatu intends to participate actively in that committee's 
work and to lend its support to those countries most immediately threatened by 
drought and desertification. We feel that addressing this problem is one of 
the greatest challenges facing the international community. 
Another of the very important measures the General Assembly will consider 
as a follow-up to the Earth Summit is the proposal to hold a world conference 
on the sustainable development of the small island States. Such a meeting is 
long overdue. We hope a resolution on convening the conference will be 
adopted by consensus and that the essential objective of the conference, which 
AOSIS is proposing be held in Barbados, will be to ensure concrete and 
meaningful action by the international community to assist the world's most 
vulnerable, yet very frequently overlooked, countries. We appeal to all 
countries to lend their support to this conference and to join us in the warm 
and friendly atmosphere of Barbados next June in order to continue our journey 
together on the road charted by the Rio Conference. 
Vanuatu is not only a small island State but also a least developed 
country. We therefore have a real concern for our economy as well as for 
political democracy. Thus, we aspire also to economic development. 
Therefore, we join in the appeals for measures to correct the trade 
imbalances, to reduce the debt burden, and to establish fair prices for our 
commodities. We believe that measures must be taken to overcome these 
scourges of underdevelopment. 

This subject is of such great importance that we approach the question of 
the reform and restructuring of the United Nations development system with a 
great deal of hope that creative approaches will be devised and effectively 
utilized in the post-cold-war period. 
We are pleased and proud to report that next month our Parliament in 
Vanuatu will act on legislation required for the ratification of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Convention on 
Biological Diversity. We strongly feel it is essential that these conventions 
be ratified, enter into force and be strictly adhered to at the earliest 
possible moment. 
We are also pleased that there is finally a convention banning chemical 
weapons. We pray that those who possess such weapons and those who would 
possess them will see the wisdom of becoming parties to that legal 
instrument and forever banning those horrible tools of death. 

Environmental disasters that have recently struck countries as diverse 
and geographically distant from each other as the Bahamas, France, Nicaragua, 
Pakistan and the United States suggest that the world has not a moment to 
spare if we are to avoid the potential global calamity that could result from 
mankind's long-term abuse of the environment. Precautionary, preventive 
measures should be taken now; otherwise it will most assuredly be too late. 
For decades, the peoples of the South Pacific have seen their region 
utilized for the testing of nuclear weapons, for the dumping of radioactive 
wastes and, most recently, for the destruction of chemical weapons. Our 
region paid high and unwanted costs for technologies from which we received 
comparatively little benefit. Today, we South Pacific leaders are very 
concerned about plans to ship plutonium through our waters. We trust that 
those who are involved in these plans will heed our voices while we still have 
voices to be heard. 
I conclude by joining in the welcome that has been expressed to all of 
our new Members. Theirs has not been an easy path to statehood, international 
recognition and membership of the United Nations. We salute their 
perseverance and their vision of their own futures. We stand ready to join 
hands with them in forging a more effective, more representative and more 
responsive United Nations. In that way we shall help to create a more 
democratic international order a world order that is democratic in fact as 
well as in word; a world order that respects all countries, whether large and 
powerful or small and vulnerable."
6228,47,1992,AUS,"I congratulate you, Mr Ganev, on your 
election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. 
You take this important position at a very challenging time for the United 

Nations and its Member States, not least for your own country, which is so 
admirably consolidating the gains of the democratization process. The 
Australian delegation looks forward to working closely with you as the session 
progresses. 
I also extend, at the outset, Australia's very warm welcome to the 13 
States for which this session will be their first as Members of the United 
Nations: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, San 
Marino, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. We have, I believe, in our own highly multicultural 
Australian population immigrants from every one of those States, and we 
already feel, as a result, that we know them well. 
In the past year we have seen the total collapse of the bipolar global 
structure which had underpinned international relations since 1945. The risks 
of a global nuclear holocaust have receded almost to the vanishing point. So 
too have the sterile ideologies of the past which for so long set obstacles in 
the way of the development of a new international system of cooperation under 
the authority of the United Nations and its agencies. 
But while the opportunities for cooperation have never been greater, the 
challenges to the international community posed by regional conflicts, 
humanitarian crises and unresolved transnational problems have also never been 
greater. What is expected of the United Nations system is now immense, but 
there is still a very big question mark over the capacity of our system to 
deliver. In the past twelve months the international community has had some 
conspicuous success in meeting some of these challenges. We have seen, for 
example, the signing of the Paris Agreements on Cambodia last October, the 
recently completed negotiation of a chemical-weapons Convention text, the 

United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) summit in Rio 
in June, movement forward in the Middle East peace process, and hopes for the 
resolution of the long-standing problems in Afghanistan, Cyprus and Western 
Sahara. 
But a number of problems have to date been beyond the capacity of the 
United Nations, or international cooperative efforts more generally, to 
resolve in a timely and wholly effective way. The most significant and tragic 
of these have been the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. 
Equally, the world has failed so far in efforts to strengthen and expand the 
liberal international trading system through the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a 
failure of just as much concern to the developing nations as to the 
developed. 
This session of the General Assembly gives us the opportunity of 
systematically reviewing where we have got to and how far we still need to go 
on the range of acute problems - political, economic and humanitarian - now 
confronting us around the globe. We are much assisted in this respect by the 
Secretary-General's report entitled 'An Agenda for Peace', on some key aspects 
of which I want to focus in this statement. The report, although 
concentrating specifically on the role of the United Nations in peacemaking, 
peace-keeping and related areas, was of course written very much against the 
background of the total challenge facing the United Nations international 
system, and in particular the critical importance of finding lasting solutions 
to the age-old problems of basic human survival and, in the words of the 
Charter, 'better standards of life in larger freedom'. 
 
If we have learned anything from the passage of years about the sources 
of conflict and war, and what is necessary to achieve peace and security, it 
is that these problems have to be addressed at many different levels. Threats 
to security arise not only from military ambition and the race to acquire 
armaments, but also from economic and social deprivation, from ignorance of 
countries about each other, from a failure to address problems that by their 
nature cross international boundaries, and from a failure by national leaders 
to trust the sense and judgment of their own people. An effective system of 
international cooperation to meet threats to peace and security itself has to 
operate at all these levels simultaneously. 
In the first place, when unbridled aggression occurs across national 
frontiers, the international community has to have a credible collective 
capacity to resist that aggression. Chapter VII of the Charter provides for 
such a peace-enforcement function. There is now in the post-cold-war era a 
manifest willingness in the international community to utilise interventionist 
Chapter VII functions, so long rendered impotent by the veto in the Security 
Council, in cases of overt aggression and other obvious cross-border threats 
to international peace and security. 
Of course not every case of aggression, or the deliberate infliction of 
suffering, occurs across State borders or in such a way as to clearly and 
unambiguously constitute a threat to international peace and security. And 
there will be a number of such situations in which the intervention of the 
international community could make a difference, so much so that there are 
large moral and political pressures upon us all to take action. It seems 
likely, unhappily, that the United Nations will increasingly be confronted 
with situations in which the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs 
will be matched by a compelling sense of international conscience. It may be 

that our Charter will never be capable of formal amendment so as to precisely 
define those circumstances in which such intervention is legitimate and those 
in which it is not. But recent experience has shown that there is an emerging 
willingness - which my country has certainly shared to accommodate 
collective intervention in extreme, conscience-shocking cases, and it may well 
be that a body of customary precedent will emerge over time and will 
constitute its own source of authority for such intervention in the future. 

The second level of necessary United Nations involvement in peace and 
security matters is peace-keeping: that activity which falls short of actual 
enforcement, but involves assistance on the ground in monitoring, supervising, 
verifying and generally securing the implementation of agreements once made. 
As the various peace-keeping operations now in place or planned for Cambodia, 
Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere amply make clear, an increasingly wide 
variety of activities, involving both military and civilian personnel, are 
being subsumed under this general umbrella: none of them are very clearly 
described in the letter of the United Nations Charter, but all of them are 
very clearly within its spirit. 
Australia strongly endorses the call by President Bush on 21 September to 
strengthen United Nations peace-keeping and related operations, and welcomes 
in particular the stated intention of the United States to look at ways of 
ensuring adequate financial support for these activities as well as for United 
Nations humanitarian activities. Financing and administration of United 
Nations peace-keeping operations are obviously key areas of its activity where 
decisions are necessary at this year's General Assembly. It is a source of 
regret that we, the nations of the world, have still not given the 
Secretary-General the financial resources or flexibility needed to undertake 
United Nations peace-keeping operations expeditiously. 
For its part, Australia would support the Secretary-General's call in 'An 
Agenda for Peace' (A/47/277) for the establishment at this session of a 
peace-keeping reserve fund, and for virtually automatic approval of one third 
of the anticipated budget for a peace-keeping operation to enable it to be 
deployed speedily and efficiently. We would also recommend that the 
Secretary-General consider further structural changes in the Secretariat as a 

means of improving the administration of peace-keeping operations, including 
the relocation of the Field Operations Division into the Department of 
Peace-keeping Operations. 
The third level of United Nations involvement in peace and security, and 
the most basic and important of all, is the prevention of conflict. We in the 
international community should be working hardest through the United Nations 
to create conditions that minimize insecurity and threats to peace, and which 
make it possible for specific high-risk situations to be addressed before they 
get to the point of requiring either peace-keeping or, worse still, coercive 
peace-enforcement responses. 
The effective prevention of conflict and risk minimization involve three 
quite distinct kinds of activity. In the first place, it involves addressing 
a variety of non-military threats to security; secondly, addressing the 
military risk to security posed by uncontrolled arms build-ups; and thirdly, 
putting in place the most effective possible preventive diplomacy and 
peacemaking arrangements to deal at an early stage with specific high-risk 
situations. I want to concentrate my remarks on what we should be doing, in 
this General Assembly and beyond, in each of these areas in turn. 
Among the gravest of all life-threatening non-military risks are those 
posed by humanitarian disasters, especially famine. The recurring tragedy of 
mass starvation in Africa often made worse by accompanying military 
conflict, but not wholly explained by that conflict underlines the need for 
the United Nations system as a whole, and the Security Council in particular, 
to strengthen its capacity to meet the problems of potential famine. 
Australia proposes the establishment of a group of senior officials from 
developed and developing countries and relevant United Nations agencies, 

supported by a strengthened Department of Humanitarian Affairs and by a 
comprehensive database, which would convene regularly to conduct high-level 
reviews of the global famine situation and identify emerging crisis 
situations. Such a group would be responsible for turning pledges into 
timely, life-saving deliveries of food to people in need, and would seek to 
ensure that donor contributions were complementary, properly coordinated and 
well-targeted. That high-level review group would report regularly, with 
appropriate recommendations, to the Security Council. 
Famine is only the most extreme example of a much more widespread global 
problem. The Secretary-General, in his address to the summit of the Movement 
of Non-Aligned Countries, identified our 'ultimate enemy' as poverty. He 
argued for the indivisibility of peace and prosperity, of political and 
economic security, of democracy and development, and environmental protection 
and sustainable development, making the point that unless we meet the threat 
posed by poverty, it will undermine all the advances we make elsewhere. We 
need to have this firmly in mind as we act for the rest of this decade and 
beyond to meet non-military threats to peace and security. 
Two issues in particular will have a crucial influence on our ability to 
prevail over these threats. One is the retreat to protectionism, which could 
well result from a failure to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round, which will 
do untold damage to many economies around the world, particularly those of the 
poorest nations, which would effectively be excluded from the benefits of an 
expansion in world trade. We cannot let pass the opportunity, provided by 
this round of negotiations, to further liberalize world trade and establish 
equitable disciplines for the new components of world trade. The recent 
summit of the Non-Aligned Movement illustrated beyond a doubt that this is a 
view shared equally by developed and developing countries. 

The other important need in this context is for prompt and effective 
follow-up to the outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development, and in particular the creation of an effective Commission on 
Sustainable Development. We cannot waste now the opportunity offered to us at 
Rio to make a serious attack on the elimination of global poverty, based on 
the principles of sustainable development. Ignoring these will produce, at 
best, only short-term solutions which will have little impact on our ability 
to secure the future of this planet. This places a particular onus on us at 
this session. Our decisions and actions will have a crucial bearing on how 
the concerns identified at Rio are taken forward. 
Natural disasters, acute poverty, famine and environmental degradation 
are all, along with war itself, major contributors to another great 
humanitarian problem and by extension security problem with which the 
international system is barely coping: the problem of unregulated population 
flows. Much important relief and rehabilitation work continues to be done for 
refugees and displaced persons by the relevant agencies, in particular the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and some useful attention has 
been recently given to the problem by the General Assembly. But crises 
continue to escalate, and there are still problems evident in the coordination 
of responses between operating and supervising bodies. Those problems have to 
be addressed as a matter of urgency, and one obvious way to do so is, again, 
to strengthen the capacity of the new Department of Humanitarian Affairs. 
There is at least one other non-military threat to peace and security 
that Australia hopes will get increased attention from this General Assembly, 
and that is the failure of Governments to observe the fundamental standards of 
 
human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration and the more detailed 
Covenants, to which so many of us have subscribed. 
The Secretary-General in his report 'An Agenda for Peace' (A/47/277) very 
properly emphasizes in this context the question of the rights of minorities. 
It is understandable that, freed from the iron restraints of totalitarian 
regimes, some ethnic and linguistic groups have sought and no doubt will 
continue to seek - to establish their own political entities. As has been all 
too graphically demonstrated in the States of former Yugoslavia, Iraq and 
elsewhere, there is no easy answer to these aspirations, particularly when 
self-determination would in such cases be synonymous with fragmentation and 
itself be a source of threat to international peace and security. War, 
particularly civil war, also engenders many of the greatest abuses of human 
rights. 
The bulk of such aspirations to self-determination might, in fact, be met 
by stricter observance of human rights and guarantees of the rights of all 
minorities ethnic, religious, linguistic or social within democratic 
frameworks. The General Assembly will have before it at this session a draft 
declaration on the rights of minorities, endorsed earlier this year by the 
Commission on Human Rights. And the launch, later this session, of the 
International Year of the World's Indigenous People to which Australia is 
very strongly committed will be a further indication of our concern in this 
regard. 

Breaches of universal human rights standards remain, unhappily, all too 
common. In a country such as Burma or Myanmar - the security of the State 
is based on a denial of fundamental human rights and the application of 
democratic processes. In South Africa, the promise of a peaceful, negotiated 
transition to majority rule continues to be put at risk by recurring violence 
of appalling intensity, itself an all too obvious legacy of the apartheid 
system. 
These and too many other examples that could be mentioned show the 
dimensions of the problem still ahead of us. They confirm the importance of 
next year's World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, particularly for 
those Governments needing further encouragement to adopt human rights 
policies - founded, I emphasize, not on so-called Western values, but on 
internationally accepted, universal standards of practice. Discussion at this 
session should play an important role in developing a consensus approach to 
the Conference. At the very least, I hope it will resolve the outstanding 
question of the agenda, which was left undecided at the recent preparatory 
meeting in Geneva. 
The General Assembly at this session might also usefully consider some 
other steps to consolidate respect for human rights. There is, for instance, 
a growing call by the international community for a mechanism to try 
individuals for breaches of international humanitarian law and other 
international crimes. Australia supports consideration being given to an 
international criminal jurisdiction to deal with such offences, and considers 
that the International Law Commission should continue its important work on 
this topic, specifically by drafting a statute for an international criminal 
court. 
 
The end of the cold war notwithstanding, a major preventive effort by the 
international community is still necessary in relation to the military threat 
to security posed by continuing arms build-ups. The climate for such an 
effort is certainly now encouraging. International endeavours in this field 
are finally producing results. After over 20 years, agreement has finally 
been reached on a chemical weapons Convention text. It is a historic 
achievement, and one for which Australia has worked particularly hard. 
Unanimous endorsement of this Convention, with a recommendation for its 
universal signature and ratification, would be one of the major outcomes of 
this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. 
We should also build on the success we have had in concluding the 
chemical-weapons Convention to reinvigorate our efforts to reach agreement on 
other elements of the multilateral disarmament agenda. The benefits to 
mankind of the end of the cold war will be quickly lost unless progress, which 
is being made in bilateral arms control and disarmament negotiations between 
the United States and the former Soviet Union, is carried into the 
multilateral arms control process. 
We must redouble our efforts to achieve a world free from nuclear 
weapons, and the threat of nuclear war. We must work harder to obtain 
universal membership of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
and ensure its indefinite extension unamended in 1995. We should also 
continue the progress that has been made since the Gulf War to strengthen the 
nuclear safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
tighten export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use items. We 
should build on the moratorium on nuclear testing advanced by Russia and 
France. And I urge Member States to support once again the draft resolution 

that Australia will co-sponsor at this session on the comprehensive test-ban 
treaty. 
Increased transparency in military activities should continue to be a key 
objective for all Members of the General Assembly. I regard the United 
Nations Register of Conventional Arms Transfers, established by the 
forty-sixth session of the General Assembly, as an important step in this 
process. Australia welcomes the Secretary-General's report on the operation 
of the Register and supports its adoption. 
At the recent summit of non-aligned countries in Jakarta, leaders 
expressed their deep concern over the negative impact of global military 
expenditure, and their support for the attainment of security at lower levels 
of armaments. We must all work to make good these pledges, thereby releasing 
sorely needed funds to help free the peoples of the world from want, as well 
as from the fear of war and destruction. 
Pursuing an effective arms control agenda and addressing a variety of 
non-military threats to security are all important ways of creating a general 
environment in which risks to security are minimized. So too are the 
peace-building strategies described in the Secretary-General's report, many of 
which are as much applicable to pre-conflict as to post-conflict situations. 
But the tools with the cutting edges in specific situations of conflict 
prevention and avoidance of conflict escalation are preventive diplomacy and 
peace-making. 
In 'An Agenda for Peace', the Secretary-General emphasized the importance 
of preventive diplomacy as a cost-effective means of avoiding the human and 
material costs of conflict and the burdens involved in using armed force to 
resolve conflicts. Indeed, if we examine the worst conflicts over the last 12 
 
months in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Afghanistan we could 
plausibly argue that, at least in the first two cases, more attention to 
preventive diplomacy may have avoided the catastrophes that befell those 
nations and peoples. Australia considers, therefore, that the challenge 
before the United Nations in the coming year will be to establish more 
effective processes for converting the promise of preventive diplomacy in all 
its aspects into reality. 
Effective preventive diplomacy cannot be ad hoc or peripheral to the 
other activities of the United Nations. What is required is a strengthened 
capacity within the United Nations to encourage and assist parties to disputes 
to resolve their differences peacefully. The crucial elements in making 
preventive diplomacy work are timing, adequate resources and the willingness 
of Member States to invest the United Nations with the authority to use all 
the means available for its effective implementation. 
In practice, the trigger for United Nations action, and the threshold for 
defining a situation as a threat to international peace and security, has 
tended to be the outbreak of armed hostilities. The earliest possible 
attention to potentially significant disputes is crucial if they are to be 
addressed before the parties have become committed and entrapped by their own 
rhetoric and actions. 
This in turn calls for the formation of a permanent unit within the 
Secretariat with an enhanced capacity to gather, receive and analyse not only 
basic facts, but also information about the concerns and interests of the 
parties to a dispute, in order better to prepare recommendations on possible 
action. This requires a more systematic approach to information-gathering and 
analysis, for which a professionally dedicated support unit in the Secretariat 
is essential. 

This will need in turn a sophisticated level of expertise and skill in 
the form of a nucleus of foreign affairs specialists and policy analysts 
experienced and knowledgeable in conflict resolution, with the skills that are 
necessary to encourage parties to a dispute to improve communication, minimize 
inflammation, define issues and create innovative and imaginative ways of 
reconciling their conflicting interests. Regular and routine field visits 
should allow an improved capacity for fact-finding, early-warning information 
gathering and the opportunity quietly to provide good offices. Staff should 
have the capacity to develop in-depth knowledge of emerging disputes and to 
gain the confidence of all parties at an early stage. An evaluation mechanism 
should be developed to collect, analyse and retain experience from such 
activities that could prove useful in other similar situations. 
I therefore applaud the decisions Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has so far 
taken to create geographically based divisions within the Department of 
Political Affairs, whose tasks will include the collection of information on 
various regions and the early identification and analysis of possible 
conflicts, and I do urge all Members to support the Secretary-General in 
further efforts to establish a professional and effective mechanism for 
preventive diplomacy. 
There is also scope, in encouraging greater use of preventive diplomacy, 
for more extensive training in the principles underpinning the concept. It is 
good to hear, in this context, that the United Nations Institute for Training 
and Research (UNITAR) is planning to launch a new fellowship programme in 
preventive diplomacy in 1993. I think it will be important for relevant 
United Nations Secretariat staff and diplomats and officials from Member 
States to participate in this fellowship programme. I am pleased to announce 
today that Australia will contribute US$ 50,000 to UNITAR to assist with the 
costs of the first year of the fellowship. I would urge that other Member 
States also consider a contribution, and participation by their officials. 
A significant challenge to an enhanced Secretariat role in preventive 
diplomacy will, of course, be the deep reluctance of many States to accept any 
suggestion that a contentious bilateral issue be internationalized. While 
there will no doubt continue to be caution about too early resort to Articles 
35 and 99 which enable Member States and the Secretary-General, 
respectively, to bring disputes to the Security Council there should not be 
the same degree of reluctance to have regard to Article 33, which requires 
parties to a dispute to first seek a solution by negotiation, mediation or the 
like. 
What has been lacking hitherto is any real institutional capacity within 
the United Nations system to respond to such approaches on other than a wholly 
ad hoc basis. The building of such a capacity for quiet diplomacy in the way 
I have been describing would be a major step forward, and help over time to 
increase the confidence of Members in other more formal United Nations 
processes. 
I have today sought to give some substance, not just rhetorical support, 
to the proposition that the changed conditions of the post-cold-war world call 
for new responses from the United Nations. The Secretary- General has shown 
us some new directions in his 'Agenda for Peace'. What is needed now is 
action. 
In nearly all cases, no major new international machinery is called for 
or necessary, because the machinery is already there in the Charter rusty, 
in some cases, but still serviceable. What is needed, however, in virtually 
every case, is the lubrication of adequate financing and restructuring within 
the United Nations system to meet the increasing demands being made on it. 
One of the really fundamental tasks we need to move forward at this session is 
continuation of the process, accordingly, of United Nations reform. 
There is no single, or simple, enemy to peace in the contemporary 
world. The appalling situation in Somalia, and the looming crises in 
Mozambique and the Sudan, are demonstrations if any are still needed - that 
problems do not come in neatly defined packages. The Somalian situation 
involves, simultaneously, humanitarian assistance, peace-keeping and political 
negotiation, with no one of these elements being capable of delivery in 
isolation. The United Nations is now organizing itself in Somalia to deliver 
these elements in an integrated way, although it has been a difficult and 
Protracted process to get to this point. The task for the United Nations in 
the future is to learn from this experience and to devote the necessary 
resources to achieving the kind of cooperation between humanitarian and 
political strategies that is going to be increasingly necessary in the future 
if durable solutions are to be found to many real world problems. 
More and more attention is going to focus, as indeed it has already 
focused in this general debate, on the role and representativeness of the 
Security Council itself. As President Soeharto said last week, speaking in 
this respect on behalf of the whole non-aligned Movement, the post-cold war 
world is not the world as it was after the Second World War. Our guiding 
light should by all means continue to be the present terms of the Charter, but 
it should be within our collective capacity to work out the changes in the 
composition and methods of decision of the Security Council that will ensure 
that it can both fulfil its duty and command overwhelming consensus for its 
decisions in the years ahead. 
In many respects the task ahead of us, and ahead of the United Nations, 
is daunting. It is clear that we are part of an evolutionary process, with 
both the world and the United Nations adjusting to new demands. We must draw 
strength from the success achieved in the last 12 months, and from the 
progress we have made in improving global co-operation. 
But our success has not been uniform: we were not able to respond 
adequately to some key challenges. We must not ever lose sight of the goal 
ahead of us: a more stable and secure world, devoid of abject poverty, with 
all peoples able to enjoy basic rights and freedoms. And we must never avoid 
the responsibility we all have to achieve those goals. "
6233,47,1992,MHL," I take this opportunity warmly to 
congratulate you. Sir, on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh 
session of the General Assembly. We know that we are in capable hand as we 
face the important tasks ahead of us. I should also like to express my 
appreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, 
for the distinguished manner in which he guided the General Assembly during 
the last session. 
It was one year ago that the General Assembly honoured the Republic of 
the Marshall Islands by granting it membership in the United Nations. On this 
anniversary, as we reflect on our times, we note that a central feature of the 
international political landscape of the past several years has been the 
emergence or the re-emergence of the nationalities. 
It is our grave responsibility to serve our nations during this 
challenging period of transition and development. Throughout the world we are 
seeing the advent of self-government by nations. The sovereignty and dignity 
of indigenous peoples are coming to be recognized as the basis for effective 
government. In the Marshall Islands, as in other developing countries 
throughout the world, we have set high aspirations for our nation and we seek 
expanded opportunities for our people. Our children will no longer be denied 

achievement of their potential because of the time and place into which they 
were born. They will be the hope and the pride of our nation, and our future. 
We are grateful to the United Nations for its steadfast commitment to 
fostering the self-government and self-determination of peoples. For many 
peoples, it has been a long time coming. 
Like so many countries, large and small, the Marshall Islands was for 
four and a half decades relegated to one camp of the great cold-war struggle. 
In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the residents of Bikini 
and Enewetak Atolls in the Northern Marshall Islands were relocated from their 
ancestral homes so that the United States Government could conduct an 
extensive and widely publicized programme of testing atomic and nuclear 
weapons. Even though the testing programme was discontinued in the late 
1950s, our Government and people are still coming to terms with its effects on 
our health and way of life. We have many good reasons to applaud the end of 
the cold war. 
 
The breakdown of the two contending camps has left a world in which we 
can no longer conveniently apply the simple classification of nations into the 
Eastern bloc or the Western block. It is a time fraught with uncertainty and 
risk, but it is also a time for rethinking our concepts of government and its 
relation to individual citizens. And with this rethinking we must see that 
greater responsibilities are opened to mankind. 
We are finding that the expediencies that once worked in the cold war 
centres of power are too broad, too large in scale, too impersonal, for the 
smaller nations. Development is now taking place on a more human scale. The 
growth of nations is providing the context for human ingenuity to assert 
itself with fewer restraints. The progress of the past decade has resulted in 
a greater portion of mankind than ever before living in situations of 
political and economic freedom. Increasingly, the human spirit has been able 
to soar unfettered by restraints and regulations imposed by authorities too 
distant from individuals' circumstances. 
In a setting of liberty, the individual is empowered to advance to the 
extent of his ability. For many years teachers in the Marshall Islands have 
sought to implement the wise insight of Marcus Aurelius: 
'Give a man a fish and you have fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish 
and you have fed him for ever.' 
Some of our teachers have even convinced themselves that this is Marshallese 
folk wisdom! But at least they recognize that the most effective help is 
self-help. 
The exchange of ideas and the reduction of trade barriers have served to 
draw mankind together. People throughout the world are now cooperating in the 
developmental process. In no nation do people live in the isolation that our 
 
ancestors did only a century ago and that some people endured until the end 
of the cold war. But, in the face of modernization, the people and places of 
the world have retained their particular attributes, and these are now giving 
force and cohesion to their national characters. 
The past year has seen the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. At this 
historic gathering the nations of the world agreed to pursue their 
developmental goals in a manner that will sustain the ecological diversity of 
our planet. We in the Marshall Islands, living on low-lying coral atolls and 
islands, have been following with great interest the scientific debate over 
global warming. The same careful approach that we have applied to evaluating 
the impact of nuclear testing in our islands is also being applied to the 
possible dangers of a rise in sea level. In this regard, I am pleased to 
reiterate the call that President Amata Kabua of the Marshall Islands made at 
the Rio Summit for the United Nations to convene a follow-up Earth Summit in 
1995, coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. 
If global warming endangers certain regions and certain modes of life, we 
have to confirm the risks and inform our citizens about them. An environment 
at risk will be a significant constraint for the developing nations in the 
late twentieth century. Nevertheless, our concern for environmental quality 
need not put a halt to the developmental process. Instead, it will be part of 
the overall situation to which individuals will respond with creativity and 
productivity. 
With the assistance of the United Nations, the people of our countries 
will continue to benefit from the international structure of trade, cultural 
exchanges, environmental studies and the resolution of disputes. 

The heart of the United Nations consists of the many Member 
nation-States. The rich mix of nationalities is certainly complicating the 
map of the world. Our challenge is to find collective benefit in this 
diversity. 
As a primary obligation, of course, we must meet basic human needs that 
are beyond local capabilities: collectively, we can help feed the starving 
refugees of Somalia; we can commit our manpower and financial resources to 
help bring peace to the Middle East and in the Balkan States; we can provide 
emergency assistance to the victims of natural disasters; we can continue to 
work towards the eradication of the great plagues. In these situations, where 
the human need is greatest, the United Nations is admirably serving its 
purposes. In addition, the techniques and processes made available by the 
agencies of the United Nations have helped provide our citizens with security 
and basic public services. 
On the other hand, the preservation of cultural diversity, and probably 
the preservation of environmental diversity, will require the direct 
commitment of nations and individuals. In an era of national consciousness, 
most matters of public policy, even those with international consequences, are 
going to be worked out at the national level - and frequently locally and 
individually. 
Let us celebrate the diverse nationalities, and do everything in our 
power to nurture our peoples and enable them to lead lives that are full and 
contented and peaceful."
6327,47,1992,NZL,"Mr. President, New Zealand congratulates 
you on your election to lead the Assembly and offers you its support in your 
task. 
One year ago I stood on this rostrum and spoke about the Gulf crisis and 
the way in which the United Nations, with strong leadership from the Security 
Council, had shown a firmness of judgement and a commitment to the ideals of 
the founders of the United Nations that reinforced the status and authority of 
the Organization. 
I spoke of my own country. New Zealand, a small nation in the south-west 
Pacific, which supported the United Nations, in keeping with our tradition of 
opposing tyranny and supporting freedom. 
This year I have returned to this Organization even more confident of the 
vital role of the United Nations in today's world, of the important 
contribution each nation, be it large or small, can make to the achievement of 
its ideals. Most important, however, I want to affirm the commitment of New 
Zealand, a founder member of the United Nations, to ensuring that this 
Organization adapts to meet the challenge of a world that has changed, is 
changing and will continue to change in the years ahead. To do that, the 
 
United Nations requires a vibrant, active General Assembly and a Security 
Council that truly reflects the different regions and the different peoples of 
the world. 
The Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali,, has made his views clear in 
putting before this Assembly his report, 'An Agenda for Peace'. His message 
is summed up in paragraphs 75 and 76, where he says: 
'With the cold war ended we have drawn back from the brink of a 
confrontation that threatened the world and, too often, paralysed our 
Organization. 
'Even as we celebrate our restored possibilities, there is a need to 
ensure that the lessons of the past ... are learned and that the 
errors ... are not repeated. For there may not be a third opportunity 
for our planet ... .' (A/47/277, paras. 75-76) 
New Zealand endorses that conclusion. 
We can also take hope from the fact that at last both the Security 
Council and the Assembly have the chance to work as they were originally 
intended, free from crippling ideological competition. Through the Security 
Council, and with the support of all the Members of the United Nations, we 
have seen decisive action to implement collective security measures on a scale 
never before possible. 
There is much still to be done, but no longer need the people of the 
world despair about impotence and inaction on the part of the United Nations. 
In Cambodia, in Somalia, in the Balkans, in the Middle East, the United 
Nations has moved to assist in the vital battle for human survival where 
before there was only the prospect of continued death and destruction. 
 
In our view, the Agenda for Peace will succeed only if we support an 
agenda for action. This is no time for complacency. The heavy cloud of the 
cold war has lifted. But over the years that cloud concealed many smaller 
conflicts and tensions regional, national and ethnic. Freed from being 
bottled up by the cold war, a growing and frightening tendency is exposed to 
settle ancient differences by the use of force. 
The Agenda for Peace also reminds us that there are other critical issues 
which threaten not only the security of Member States but also the future of 
the planet itself. 
Poverty, disease, malnutrition, crippling levels of debt and negligible 
economic growth are scourges in themselves. They can unleash despair and 
anger that will destabilize political and social institutions. 
Environmental degradation does not threaten only our immediate 
surroundings and livelihoods; problems such as the depletion of the ozone 
layer, the spread of toxic chemicals, climate change and the overfishing of 
the seas put at risk the well-being of whole communities, and even the very 
survival of certain small island countries. 
Weapons of mass destruction continue to proliferate. We must take a 
stand against those who are blind to the lessons of the past and remain 
determined to acquire or expand their stocks of nuclear or other weapons of 
mass destruction. 
The Secretary-General reminds us, too, that 
'social peace is as important as strategic or political peace'. 
 
It is clear that a root cause of insecurity and conflict at the international 
level is the existence of social structures, policies and systems within 
States which marginalize minorities or other groups. Such tension will be 
resolved only when the social needs of the underprivileged are addressed. The 
proposed United Nations social Summit could have a catalytic role to play in 
this area. I suggest that it is only through tolerance and through talking to 
one another that we can all encourage and achieve full respect for human 
rights and implement the international standards as they were intended. 
 
The other very important issues raised by the Secretary-General must be 
considered thoroughly. This session of the Assembly provides the first 
opportunity to debate them and I wish to outline New Zealand's views. 
First, let me refer to peace and security. New Zealand stands very 
firmly behind the United Nations as an instrument for collective action when 
security is threatened. The situations which the world wants the United 
Nations to respond to today are not the same as those of the cold-war era. 
New Zealand supports concepts such as preventive diplomacy, peace-keeping and 
peace-building. As a world body we know that consensus is important but 
collectively we must be bold, we must be innovative. 
New Zealand believes it is vital that the United Nations respond to 
situations which threaten the peace or cry out for global action, wherever in 
the world they may occur. We cannot, we must not, allow parts of the world to 
be marginalized or thought less important than others. The tragedy in Somalia 
is different from, but of equal horror to, that in what was Yugoslavia. 
Secondly, I want to endorse strongly the conclusion that there is an 
inextricable link between security and economic development. This is not a 
new or radical idea. Every political leader knows from domestic experience 
that a nation feels more secure when its economy is performing strongly. 
People in every country have rapidly growing expectations, but with the global 
economy very sluggish leaders are finding it difficult to satisfy these 
ambitions. 
Further, we need major sustainable growth in the global economy if the 
development concerns identified at the Earth summit at Rio are to be achieved. 
One fact, though self-evident, must be repeated: sustainable and 
equitable economic growth and development will be possible only if there is an 
open and fair international trading system. 

As a world community we need the courage to pull down the artificial 
barriers to economic growth. The solution is in our hands. We need leaders 
to say 'Yes' to fair trade and 'No' to their protectionist lobbies. If we 
knock out the selfish and inward-looking tendencies to protectionism and 
subsidization, we will create a surge in global trade and real growth in the 
global economy. It will provide the opportunities we all want - so let's do 
it. 
The alternative is bleak. History shows only too clearly what can happen 
if there is a deep and prolonged global recession. Political extremists come 
to the fore and begin to manipulate desperate people. Disintegrating 
economies fall into the hands of dictators, and international peace and 
security are quickly put at risk. 
But this need not be so. It is not inevitable. A breakthrough in the 
multilateral trade negotiations, the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), is achievable, given the right degree of political 
will. There is a risk that the political will may ebb away, that the focus 
may be lost, that excuses for delay may become more important than reasons to 
press on. Should that prove true, then the bold reform set out in the Dunkel 
text will go down as one more lost opportunity. We cannot afford that so we 
New Zealand - continue to urge the European Community and the United States to 
resolve their differences and to put the GATT talks back on track for a 
successful conclusion. For world economic growth, it is not an optional 
extra; it is essential. 
Just as economics and security are closely linked, the world seems to 
have accepted, just in time, that there is a third element to this equation. 
It is the environment. Everything we do has an impact on the environment. If 

we cripple the environment, it will affect our economies, our societies and 
our security. Moreover, these impacts will not respect national boundaries. 
Before the Earth summit, some important first steps were taken. The 
Montreal Protocol proved that the world had the political will to deal with 
the problem of ozone depletion. The General Assembly itself responded to the 
challenge of drift-net fishing and has secured a moratorium on that 
ecologically-destructive technique of fishing. 
The Earth summit, under the auspices of the United Nations, has given us 
a challenging work programme, 'Agenda 21', to match the Secretary-General's 
proposals, 'An Agenda for Peace'. But international agendas only work if 
nations are committed to their success. 
New Zealand went to the Earth summit committed to working for consensus 
solutions to the problems of environment and development which ultimately 
threaten us all. 
New Zealand is a country endowed with a rich environmental inheritance. 
But we understand that our good fortune does not give us the moral right to 
point the finger at other countries which are struggling for their very 
survival. At the same time, our considerable experience in sustainable 
resource management - for example, in the development of new forests can be 
helpful in the search for practical solutions to problems of resource 
depletion. 
As part of New Zealand's commitment to environmental protection and to 
providing sustainable resources, we have just agreed to go ahead with the 
planting of another 200,000 hectares of forest. 
At the Earth summit, we accepted a commitment to augment our aid 
programme as soon as possible in order to assist in the prompt and effective 
 
implementation of Agenda 21. Our development assistance projects, based on 
consultation with our partner countries, particularly in the South Pacific, 
have always had a strong focus on the environment and on sustainable 
development. 
But aid alone is not enough. New Zealand, like many countries which 
depend on agricultural exports, has been severely disadvantaged by a world 
trading system which handicaps non-subsidized and efficient producers. We 
therefore strongly support the call in Agenda 21 for an open, transparent and 
non-discriminatory trading system that reveals the real environmental costs of 
unsustainable production and enables all countries to pursue truly sustainable 
development on a secure and equitable basis. 
To achieve that would be to achieve a real foundation for peace and 
progress. I am not making these observations from an ivory tower. For its 
part. New Zealand already has one of the most open economies in the world. 
Yes, there was a short-term cost in achieving that, but now we are reaping 
rewards through higher productivity and international competitiveness. 
Despite the progress made from the ending of the cold war, we have not 
yet removed the threat from weapons of mass destruction. 
New Zealand warmly welcomed the agreement reached by President Bush and 
President Yeltsin in June. The two largest nuclear arsenals are to be reduced 
by some 70 per cent. That is remarkable progress and both leaders deserve and 
have our thanks. They have made historic progress but we must keep the 
momentum up. Unless we take decisive action, the dangers from nuclear 
proliferation will increase. 

Therefore we must build on the leadership shown by two nuclear-weapon 
States in declaring moratoriums. We must advance the goal, which New Zealand 
has unwaveringly pursued, of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We must 
strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards regime. And we 
must secure an indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons in 1995. 

France's decision to suspend testing has been widely welcomed by New 
Zealand and Pacific island countries in the South Pacific Forum region. It 
has opened the way for significantly more positive relations between France 
and the region, which I welcome. We hope the moratorium will be maintained, 
and copied by others. 
Another milestone approaches, with the presentation to this session of 
the General Assembly of a treaty banning another class of weapons of mass 
destruction: chemical weapons. Patient and persistent efforts over 20 years 
will have their reward. New Zealand has strongly supported those efforts and 
intends to be an original signatory to the treaty. We urge other countries to 
take the same step. 
And we must not ignore the continued proliferation of conventional 
armaments. There are legitimate concerns about the levels and availability of 
highly destructive conventional weapons. The implementation of the United 
Nations Register of Conventional Arms would be a useful first step on the way 
to greater accountability in this area. 
Finally, I want to touch on the institutional issues the 
Secretary-General has raised. We strongly endorse the role that is envisaged 
for the United Nations to work with, and on occasions through, regional 
organizations that have some special contribution they can make. Already in 
South Africa we see cooperation between the United Nations and the 
Commonwealth beginning to bear positive fruit. In Somalia the Organization of 
African Unity (OAU), the League of Arab States and the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference have contributed positively to the United Nations mission. 
In the Americas the Organization of American States (OAS) has played an 
increasingly effective role. 

The United Nations role in Cambodia is of particular importance in this 
regard. The operation is unique and deserves the highest praise. But the 
countries of the region - which include New Zealand, with 100 men and women in 
the United Nations force have also played a major part in bringing about the 
conditions necessary for a successful United Nations involvement. Regional 
organizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have 
been indispensable in this process. 
The fact of the matter is that the United Nations cannot do everything. 
Neither do I expect it to do everything - but free from the shackles of the 
past it now has a new authority which it must exercise wisely. To maintain 
its authority we must ensure that democratic principles are applied to the 
workings of the United Nations itself. That means that the small must be 
represented in major United Nations decision-making as well as the large. 
It means that there must be fair and regular rotation among Member 
States. And it means we must evolve processes that will allow constructive 
communication between the Security Council and the wider United Nations 
membership so that broad coalitions in support of Security Council action can 
be forged while preserving room for quick and decisive actions where necessary. 
New Zealand's commitment to a strong, effective and democratic United 
Nations has never wavered. At the beginning, at the San Francisco Conference 
in 1945, New Zealand championed the broadest possible participation in 
decision-making. Over the years we have backed up our words with a real 
commitment to United Nations peace-keeping efforts. We have participated thus 
far in 15 such operations: New Zealanders have worn the blue beret in Croatia 
and Bosnia, Lebanon, Cyprus, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Namibia, Angola, 
Cambodia, the Congo and Yemen. In addition. New Zealand supplied personnel to 
assist the United Nations with mine removal in Afghanistan. 

In conclusion, I want to return to the two agendas which are before this 
Assembly and which seek to achieve a new partnership of nations. Nothing is 
more important than the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for the Environment 
and Sustainable Development. The United Nations Secretary-General and the 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development have both identified 
monumental challenges for the General Assembly for several years to come. 
They also highlight the reality of global interdependence. The way ahead has 
to lie in cooperation rather than confrontation, in a recognition that the 
future of each of us is tied up with the future of us all and that no agenda, 
no matter how noble its goals, will succeed unless first and foremost we are 
prepared to work for them. New Zealand is. 
"
6338,47,1992,PNG,"On behalf of the Government and 
people of Papua New Guinea, I should like to congratulate you. Sir, on your 
election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh 
session. Your personal presence in this Hall, and your unanimous election to 
preside over our proceedings, are symbolic not only of the stirring changes 
which have been occurring in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but 
of the manner in which they have been welcomed around the world. In offering 
you my delegation's greetings, cooperation and support, I should also like to 
pay tribute to the efficient manner in which your predecessor. 
Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, performed his duties. 
Just as your election. Sir, is symbolic of wider changes in the world, so 
is the presence here for the first time of delegations from States which for a 
period were incorporated in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. My 
delegation takes very great pleasure in welcoming the membership of, and 
participation in the United Nations by, the nine States which were once part 
of the Soviet Union and the three States which were once part of Yugoslavia 
whose representatives have just joined us. Their presence provides eloquent 
testimony to the power of ordinary people to resist - and eventually to 
overcome - both the ideology and the technology that are used in order to 
oppress them. 
With the addition of San Marino, the goal of universal membership - and 
of global coverage - of the United Nations is now in sight. 
Coming from a region where membership of the United Nations is less 
widespread than it is in other parts of the world, I pledge my Government's 
cooperation in the efforts to strengthen links between other South Pacific 
island States and the United Nations. 

Previous statements in this debate have made it quite clear that we have, 
in the words of the Secretary-General in 'An Agenda for Peace', 
'entered a time of global transition.' (A/47/277, para. 11) 
The Jakarta Message issued by the Tenth Summit Conference of Heads of 
State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which my Government has 
just become a full member, describes the present as 'a time of profound change 
and rapid transition.' But transition to what? And will the effects be the 
same around the globe? 
Even as we welcome the end of the cold war, we would do well to bear in 
mind the observation made in 'An Agenda for Peace', that 
'the issues between States north and south grow more acute.' (A/47/277. 
para. 8) 
It is, again in the words of the Jakarta Message: 
'a time of great promise as well as grave challenge, a time of 
opportunity amidst pervasive uncertainty.' 
It is no accident that the preamble to the Charter contains not only 
political, but economic and social objectives, or that the Charter provides 
for both a Security Council and an Economic and Social Council. Security has 
never been simply a military or a political question; it has always had 
economic and social aspects. For people in developing countries in particular 
the economic and social aspects of security are inseparable from and often 
of great immediate importance than the military and political aspects. 
If the transition on which so many previous speakers believe we have 
embarked is to be towards global peace, then we need to pay greater attention 
to the economic and social issues which divide North and South. Thus my 
Government supports the proposal to convene, looks forward to taking part in. 

and hopes for a positive outcome from, the world summit for social development 
proposed to be held in 1995. 
Disappointed though my Government is in the level of agreement reached at 
the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in 
Rio de Janeiro in June this year, we shall continue to support the UNCED 
effort in particular and similar efforts by the United Nations generally. We 
have therefore offered to host a regional post-Rio seminar to follow up on 
UNCED in Port Moresby in November. 
My Government welcomes the changes which have allowed people in Central 
and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia to participate directly in 
national political and economic life again. We welcome them and their 
Governments to greater participation in international political and economic 
affairs, too. 
We welcome no less the changes which have led to the replacement of 
dictatorships in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. But in doing so I would 
not be honest unless I added that we are concerned about ensuring that the 
change is both comprehensive and enduring. 
My Government is profoundly disturbed by the savage violence and terrible 
suffering being experienced by the victims of 'ethnic cleansing' in the former 
Yugoslavia and of interracial, religious and ethnic conflicts there and 
elsewhere. 
We sympathize with the concerns expressed by the members of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference, and support the efforts being made by 
the United Nations and the European Economic Community to reduce these 
conflicts and to provide aid. 

But, as the Secretary-General has so pointedly reminded the world, there 
are terrible conflicts and suffering no less worthy of attention in other 
parts of the world, including Somalia. 
It seems distressingly significant that evert after the end of the cold 
war, and during the global transition which the Secretary-General has so 
eloquently analysed, part of the world where most humans live and where needs 
are greatest is still referred to and treated as a very poor third. 
I ask you. Sir, to cast your mind back to the 1960s, when foreign 
domination came to an end in many parts of the world, a record number of new 
Members was admitted to the United Nations and the prospects for democracy and 
development seemed, by common consent, to be quite bright. Then think of the 
economic difficulties which often followed, and the dictatorships which all 
too frequently lasted until the present transition. And then ask why, 
whatever our hopes might be, we should expect that the future will be 
different. 
 
The world has learned or, at least, should have learned - from the 
past. But have we all drawn the right conclusions? And what have we done to 
act on even the most obvious of our conclusions? 
It is one thing to welcome the holding of free elections. It is quite 
another to be certain either that they make a difference, or that they will 
continue to be held in an orderly, constitutional and fair way. 
Politicians characteristically promise results. Their ability to be 
re-elected depends on results. So, too, does democracy itself. In other 
words, democracy, like security, is more than a matter of politics; it also 
has economic and social roots. 
In developing countries or, more precisely, countries where development 
is a far-distant aim rather than a near-reality democracy depends not only 
on opportunities for political participation, but on opportunities for 
economic and social participation as well. As one who has played a modest 
part in constitution-making in Papua New Guinea, I am proud that the National 
Goals and Directive Principles contained in our national Constitution 
explicitly recognize that point. 
I can recall a time, before Papua New Guinea became independent, when not 
only free elections but free markets were widely regarded as characteristic 
or, at least, attainable - goals of many developing countries. I can also 
recall the pain and anger felt by ordinary village people when they discovered 
that free elections and free markets did not necessarily benefit them. 
I am, in fact, spokesman for a movement which mobilized tens of thousands 
of people to ensure that political and economic development would serve their 
interests, and which paved the way to Papua New Guinea's independence. It is 

precisely because of the lessons I learned from, and with, my people that I 
have chosen to make opportunity and participation the main theme of the policy 
I shall follow as my Government's Minister for Foreign Affairs. Those lessons 
are also among the reasons why my Government will be seeking support for an 
initiative designed to help identify, create, maintain, diversify and enlarge 
opportunities for economic participation, with particular reference to 
developing countries. 
'An Agenda for Peace' is a most constructive contribution to thinking 
about conflict-avoidance, conflict-management and conflict-reduction after the 
end of the cold war. The initiative on self-determination being pursued by the 
Government of Liechtenstein should provide support for, and assist in, the 
development of ideas contained in the report. Ongoing discussions concerning 
options for reform of the United Nations, including the High-Level Working 
Group set up by the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as many statements made in 
the current debate, are clearly intended to contribute to the same end. It is 
surely among the most promising signs of the times that we can talk of a 
global agenda at all - and that the global agenda should be for peace. 
The initiative which my Government proposes is intended to be, in effect, 
the economic counterpart to 'An Agenda for Peace'. Our aim is not to engage 
again in a general debate on development issues - although we have an obvious 
interest in continuing discussion of the nature, direction, pace and 
international environment for developmental change but to stimulate the 
exchange of practical ideas and experiences relevant to enhancing and 
increasing opportunities for economic participation for the benefit of people 
in developing countries. 

In short, the proposal is to seek support for the appointment of a panel 
of distinguished, expert and experienced persons to prepare a practical report 
based on experience in diverse countries and on a close, critical analysis of 
possible options for presentation to the United Nations. 
My Government's plan is to seek the support of fellow members of the 
South Pacific Forum and other regional groups to which we belong or with 
which, like the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have close 
and cordial relations, to raise the proposal for consideration by members of 
the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement, and to discuss it on a bilateral 
basis as widely as we can with a view to submitting a resolution to the 
Assembly at its forty-eighth session. We would hope to see a panel appointed 
in time to present a report during the forty-ninth session of the General 
Assembly, and to have it debated in 1995. 
Like many other countries represented in this Assembly, Papua New Guinea 
inherited many of its economic, legal and other arrangements from abroad. Many 
of the practices, policies and laws followed in the monetary sector of our 
national economy were originally devised in different conditions, by different 
people and to serve different objectives. 
We believe that we have not exhausted - or even considered all 
practical policy or legal options for facilitating economic participation by 
our citizens in either national or international affairs. We have not had 
ready and systematic access to experiences elsewhere. 
We do not believe that market forces on their own will necessarily allow 
our people adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit from economic 
development without further change. 
 
Further options need to be identified and further changes will have to be 
made if people seeking to participate in economic development from the 
baseline at which most people in developing countries start are to be able to 
identify, utilize and benefit from the opportunities which are more often in 
theory than in practice available to them. We want to learn what the 
options are. 
My Government will, therefore, be looking to other Members of the United 
Nations for support and ideas to advance our proposal. The result will, we 
hope, be an important, practical guide to options for creating, maintaining, 
diversifying and/or enlarging opportunities for economic participation, with 
particular reference to developing countries. 
My Government has recently found itself being criticized, for the first 
time, before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the 
Joint Assembly of the African, Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome 
Convention and the European Economic Community over human rights abuses in the 
North Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea. 
It gives me no pleasure to say, even though it is true, that most of the 
abuses, for which parties on all sides of the conflict must accept some 
responsibility, occurred while a previous Government was in office, and that 
my colleagues and I opposed them at the time. As members of the present 
Government, we are now responsible for resolving the situation, whatever its 
causes. We must accept responsibility for what we decide or condone from now 
on. But the situation which gave rise to the criticism to which I have 

referred owes much to economic practices, policies and laws which were devised 
with little or no regard for popular participation, and with even less regard 
for the particular characteristics of the societies in which most of the 
people in the area continue to live. 

It also highlights the need to recognize that processes which might help 
alleviate tensions and reduce conflicts in some parts of the world might not 
have the same effects in others. They might, in fact, only make matters worse. 
For Papua New Guinea, as for many other developing countries which have 
become independent since the Second World War, nation-building remains a 
difficult problem and a pressing concern. The issue for us is not, as it is 
elsewhere, to find ways of managing ethnic and other tensions now that the 
ideological and technological weight of the cold war has been lifted from 
previously subject peoples, but rather to reconcile differences within and 
harness them to a common, national cause. 
Furthermore, my Government has taken the view that dealing with human 
rights on their own is often not to the point. It can, in fact, be irrelevant 
and can even actively contribute to further suffering. 
My Government has, therefore, admitted that wrongs have been committed by 
participants on all sides of the conflict in Papua New Guinea's North Solomons 
Province. It has taken steps to ensure that they cease and are not repeated 
and has invited other Governments and international organizations to help 
redress them by contributing, for example, to the costs of assessing needs, 
planning rehabilitation and restoring services to people who have suffered 
without them. 
My Government believes that Papua New Guineans are best placed to resolve 
the conflict; but we look to others for help in rehabilitating people, 
repairing damage and restoring services. 
My Government intends to be among the concerned participants in the 
second world conference on human rights, scheduled for June 1993. As was done 
at the tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, we reaffirm the 
universality of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are 

embodied in the Papua New Guinea Constitution. But, like other members of the 
Non-Aligned Movement, we believe that economic and social progress facilitates 
the achievement of such rights and freedoms, which is why I have emphasized 
economic opportunity and participation. For similar reasons we welcome the 
broad scope proposed for the world conference on women in 1995, which focuses 
on action in the context of equality, development and peace. 
As an active participant in the work of the Fourth Committee of the 
General Assembly and the Committee of 24, my Government is a strong supporter 
of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (1990-2000). 
We therefore look forward to hosting a Pacific regional seminar on 
decolonization in Port Moresby in 1993 in order to help further the plan of 
action for the Decade. 
In our immediate region, we continue to support United Nations 
involvement in the decolonization of New Caledonia and trust that the outcome 
of the forthcoming mid-term review of the implementation of the Matignon 
Accords will lead to further progress towards safeguarding the legitimate 
rights of the Kanaks. 
As far as other developments in the South Pacific are concerned, we 
welcome the French Government's decision to suspend its nuclear-weapon-testing 
programme in French Polynesia. We urge that it be ended for good. 
We look to the Government of the United States of America to honour 
President Bush's promise to limit the use of Johnston Atoll for disposing of 
weapons which were never directed at us while they were active but which now 
threaten our safety, health and economic welfare. 
We seek assurances that the Pacific Ocean will not be used to transport 
plutonium or other hazardous nuclear, chemical or biological materials which 
 
might pollute the seas on which we rely. Promises that every precaution will 
be taken are simply not enough. 
Like the Governments of other South Pacific island countries, we are 
sympathetic to the aspirations of those who favour increased regional economic 
cooperation in Europe and North America. We support efforts to assist former 
communist States in the immense task of economic and social reconstruction 
which lies ahead. But, like the Governments of other developing countries, we 
in the South Pacific are concerned that regional integration and efforts to 
meet needs in other parts of the world should not proceed at the expense of 
the needs of our people. 
We are also concerned that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) be brought to an early conclusion, with due regard 
for the need to secure and expand opportunities for the economic participation 
of developing countries in the international economy. It is, in fact, 
precisely because we believe that opportunities for economic participation 
should be greater and more equitably distributed than they have been that my 
Government has proposed the initiative I have previously outlined. 
My Government supports the active role being taken by the United Nations, 
in difficult circumstances, to ensure peace and to bring about a return to 
normalcy in Cambodia. We also support efforts to secure peace in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and to facilitate relief efforts in Somalia. We are heartened by 
what we have heard from the Governments of Israel and neighbouring States 
concerning the prospects for a negotiated settlement of outstanding sources of 
conflict in the Middle East. 
We are cautiously hopeful about the prospects for a democratic, 
non-racial South Africa. But, as the situation now stands, my Government 

believes that it should maintain existing bans on all dealings with South 
Africa, continue to monitor developments there closely and consider relaxing 
those bans only as further progress occurs in the desired direction and in 
close consultation with African States. 
Like our predecessors, my Government supports efforts to limit the 
production and sale of arms. We believe that unwanted foreign military forces 
should be removed from countries which do not pose a threat to their 
neighbours or to international law. 
However, coming as I do from a developing country, I feel it important to 
repeat that we need to acknowledge the reality, recognized also in the report 
'An Agenda for Peace', that there are non-military threats to peace which are 
perhaps becoming more obvious than ever before. My Government agrees with the 
observation made in the report that there is a need to strengthen arrangements 
to identify, monitor, synthesize information about and act collectively to 
avert, reduce and limit such threats, with sensitivity to local circumstances, 
including the interests of well-intentioned States, and with full regard for 
international law. 
I cannot help noticing not only how the membership and the agenda of the 
General Assembly have changed in recent years but also how the content, tone 
and frankness with regard to domestic difficulties, and even the length of 
contributions to the general debate, have changed, and generally for the 
better. 
 
As head of my country's delegation, I have had the privilege of listening 
to delegations from newly admitted Member States make use of the opportunity 
to participate in the General Assembly on their own account for the first 
time. I trust that other Governments will see fit to support my proposal for 
a United Nations-sponsored initiative to prepare and discuss a detailed report 
on how best to go about the task complementary to securing increased 
opportunities for political participation of securing increased 
opportunities for economic participation, with particular reference to needs 
in and of developing countries. Opportunity and participation are the keys to 
political development, security and peace. They are also the keys to economic 
development and justice, including equity between, and within, the northern 
and southern parts of the globe. 
"
6378,45,1990,NZL,"﻿
I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the presidency at a time when the Organization stands at the threshold of opportunity and faces complex challenges. What is true for the Organization is true, too, for my country. In New Zealand 1990 marks 150 years since the foundations of our nation State were laid.
The basic compact, the Treaty of Waitangi, was signed in 1840 by the tribal chiefs of the country they referred to as Aotearoa, and by representatives of the British Crown on behalf of the new settlers in the country they called New Zealand. It was an agreement to live and work in co-operation. There are still significant challenges to our partnership - to honour broken promises and to redress historical wrongs. We are working for a society where ethnic and cultural differences are valued as strengths rather than rejected as weaknesses. We are trying to put our house in order.
The end of the cold war presents the United Nations with the opportunity in 1990 to put the global house in order, to make a fresh and reinvigorated commitment to the world's security. The Secretary-General reminded us in his annual report that a comprehensive approach to security is the very essence of the existence of the United Nations. New Zealand vigorously endorses that view, λ balanced and integrative approach to security - acknowledgement of our common security needs and of the role of the Unite Nations - is central to the protection of the interests of small countries. We believe that small countries have much to offer the United Nations. Many of the world's citizens live in small countries which have modest aspirations, which do not wish to engage in wars, and which cannot force their views on others. Indeed, the major security threats to our country and its immediate region, the islands of the South Pacific, are not military but rather environmental and economic.
New Zealand and the rest of the South Pacific are fortunate in that we are removed from areas of conflict or significant international tension. But we are by no means isolated. Global, economic, political and environmental developments can often impact sharply on small countries which are distant from the epicentre of world events, a commitment to the common security needs of the global community is important at a time like this when we all face the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
New Zealand has unreservedly condemned Iraq's aggression against a small neighbour and the repugnant actions taken against foreign nationals. The people most affected, of course, are the Kuwaitis themselves, who are suffering from an attempt by an aggressive neighbour to extinguish their country's independent existence. However, also experiencing immediate anguish are the many thousands of foreign nationals caught up in the crisis, especially those detained against their will. There are only a handful of New Zealanders amongst them, but the small number does not diminish the significance of their plight for the Government and people of New Zealand. We consider the continued holding of hostages to be an outrage and we urge Iraq to release all those detained and to respect immediately all the resolutions of the Security Council.  
Of course, a fundamental concern remains the dreadful possibility of a war that could escalate rapidly to encompass many countries and perhaps spread to other regions. The whole world has an interest in ensuring that does not occur and that a resort to armed conflict is avoided.
In that process, respect for the principles and values of the United Nations - and the use of its mechanisms by all of us - is essential. New Zealand indicated at an early stage to the United Nations Secretariat its readiness to contribute to any operations in the Gulf region under United Nations auspices. I confirm that offer today. In particular, New Zealand has demonstrated willingness and ability to contribute to United Nations peace-keeping operations. We have committed ourselves to the supply of food and medical assistance, and our aircraft have ferried some of the refugees from the area back to their home countries - Pakistan and the Philippines in particular. 
The Gulf crisis has illustrated vividly the potential for the United Nations to provide a swift, effective response to regional conflict. The achievement to date has been considerable.
This is the first opportunity for New Zealand to state its view of the Gulf crisis in the framework of the Organization, and I would like to add a cautionary note to what other speakers have said. We all understand the implications of a further escalation of the Gulf crisis. Against that background, it is vital that the support of all United Nations Members be sustained for collective responses. Care must be taken never to presume too much. It is after all the United Nations Members as a whole who, in Article 24: 'confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security'. That act of conferral underpins all else. 

The actions in the past weeks in the Security Council in regard to that whole issue have truly historical significance. They establish precedents for practical responses to other and different regional conflicts or disputes. All of us - Security Council permanent members, non-permanent members, and non-Security Council members - are, I think, sufficiently clear about the importance of what is currently being achieved.
But we need to give more thought to how that process is undertaken. As a first step, there is room for improving among us all, and, irrespective of our place in the scheme of things, the sharing of information, perceptions and conclusions about how United Nations responses should best be formulated. Such a process is going to be indispensable in the longer run to achieving our shared purpose, big country and small, within the Organization. Our collective response to the present threats to global stability depends on a background of substantial achievement at and since the last session of the General Assembly.
The independence of Namibia, the signs of political progress in South Africa, the constructive steps towards a settlement in the Western Sahara, and the progress towards resolution of the situation in Cambodia together comprise a significant list of achievements. The gathering consensus among the five permanent members of the Security Council, and the new spirit that animates the relations between the super-Powers, are great achievements. But it is the tasks which remain that will provide the real test of the United Nation’s capabilities and of what the future will hold for us all.
That brings me back once again to common security. At a time when there has been so much hope expressed - and yet we still face such daunting problems - there is a need for increased commitment to strengthening the threads of our common security. Many hope that we are now witnessing the emergence of a new order. It is certainly time for it. 
But to achieve it we Must put away the old ways of thinking, the old ways of acting. We need a change of attitude towards what constitutes security. We need s new respect for our rapidly diminishing natural resources. We need an acknowledgment that human rights and freedoms depend not only on resolutions passed at international meetings, but on the implementation of decisions that will facilitate real economic choices for countries.
For many nations, particularly those of the South, the problems of trade, indebtedness and economic underdevelopment are enduring. Unless there are greater moves towards the liberalization of trade, there will be no real progress. In the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations is nearing the deadline for its completion. New Zealand is pinning its hopes on its success. The prospects of new trade opportunities for all cannot be overrated.
This represents a last chance for GATT. In 40 years, the system has failed to produce an equitable trading environment for the majority of its members. In the area of agricultural trade, which is of principal concern to my country, GATT has been a singular disappointment. It has condoned protectionism and subsidization, principally by the major economic Powers, which have over the years corroded economic opportunity and potential for commodity-trading countries.
At a time when the idea of burden-sharing is gaining currency, we should reflect upon the fact that the burden of protectionism in several major industrialized economies has been carried by other countries. It is even more instructive to reflect that agricultural support and subsidization inside the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was estimated for 1989 at $245 billion - six times the total of resources transferred by those countries to developing countries in that same year. 
The GATT outcome in December is the litmus test. The principal adjustments in that trade round will have to come from those more powerful economies whose influence has shaped, or misshaped, the trade rules for nearly half a century. At this very moment, those self-same countries have in their grasp the opportunity to effectively manage regional political security in our world in better and more imaginative ways than have ever boon contemplated previously. Resource transfers are needed not only address the endemic problems of economic underdevelopment, but also to assist in the attack on what has been only toe recently acknowledged - environmental degradation.
That is another	in which the interests of some countries are inextricably involved with the actions of others. It is an area where the embracing of the idea of common security is essential for survival. New Zealand's own immediate neighbours in the South Pacific provide ample demonstrations of that. Far from being a vast, uninhabited sea, the great South Pacific Ocean contains tens of thousands of islands, over 1,000 distinct languages, and a great variety of different cultures. But many of those are small islands, atoll countries whose very existence is threatened by the sea-level rise predictor it greenhouse gas emissions are not contained by industrialised countries.
The ecosystem of our marine environment is also threatened from the outside by the wanton stripping of resources and the dumping of wastes. The environmental security of the South Pacific is totally interdependent with that of the wider Asia-Pacific region and the global community. To preserve our environmental security we must have sustained political commitment to making hard decisions.
The United Nations has just begun preparations for the vitally important 1992 Conference on Environment and Development. New Zealand intends playing a full and constructive part, and our Government will be working with our non-governmental organizations to bring our country's perspective to the Conference. Assistance must be given to the developing countries, in particular to enable them to repair the environmental damage aggravated by poverty and to help them avoid reliance on environmentally destructive technologies. The General Assembly has a critical role in carrying forward the environmental debate, forming decisions upon which Governments can act.
The achievement last year of a significant resolution on driftnet fishing and the actions which have followed it provide ample proof of what can be achieved. We need to build upon that. Urgent measures must be taken in a number of areas, particularly to prevent climate change and preserve the earth's biodiversity.
Even though it has undoubtedly been triggered by a crisis situation, the increasing recognition of the need for international co-operation to preserve the environment is an encouraging sign of global support for new sorts of security policies. However, in the final analysis our common security also depends on maintaining and strengthening world peace. 
We all welcome the new opportunities offered by the end of the cold war. There has undoubtedly been major progress over the last year, in the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, the agreement in principle on reductions in strategic nuclear weapons and the negotiations on conventional stability in Europe. But the most remarkable symbol of the end of the cold war is of course that from this week onwards there will be only one German delegation at the United Nations. The peaceful reunification of the German nation is a momentous achievement. We support unreservedly the efforts of the two major Powers and other countries involved in those processes. We look to a world ruled by peace and stability rather than by military confrontation. 
But, while we look to the future with greater hope, we must also do so without illusions. The crisis in the Gulf region reminds us all too starkly that the maintenance of peace requires a real commitment. We cannot assume that peace will happen as the inevitable result of historical trends. All of us - great Powers and small - share a responsibility to ensure that new opportunities become significant achievements.
Up till now the vigorous pursuit of conventional arms dealing has played a major part in the creation of conflicts. Governments cannot escape their responsibility to halt this proliferation. We in New Zealand are committed to playing a constructive and imaginative role in the disarmament process and in participating in achieving real security in our region and internationally.
New Zealand's commitment to peace-keeping is reflected in our involvement in the Middle East in the United Nations truce supervision operation and in the Iran-Iraq observer group, as well as in the non-United Nations peace-keeping operation in the Sinai. New Zealand police assisted with the transition to independence in Namibia. In our own region, we recently provided facilities to help with the negotiation and reconciliation of the dispute over the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea.
An important contribution made by the countries of our region to the global nuclear disarmament process has been the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone, endorsed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly last year. The Treaty complements the nuclear-free policies which New Zealand has adopted domestically. Two permanent members of the Security Council have given their formal commitment to this initiative by signing the relevant protocols of the Treaty. Two others have given assurances that their actions are not inconsistent with the Treaty's provisions. We urge all the nuclear-weapon States to make a formal commitment by signing the protocols to the Treaty.
The establishment of a South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone has thrown into even sharper contrast the way France continues to test its nuclear weapons, in defiance of the wishes of the countries of the region. Our protests against testing by a nuclear Power in the South Pacific, outside its metropolitan territory, have been ignored. It is intolerable that a region which is com- .¿d to nuclear-free principles should be used as a test site for the development of nuclear-weapon technology. For a number of years New Zealand and Australia have sponsored draft resolutions in this Assembly calling for an end to the testing of all nuclear weapons. We shall be sponsoring such a draft resolution again this year.
More than any other single measure, a comprehensive test ban would help slow down the nuclear arms race. We ask the permanent members of the Security Council to respond to the overwhelming demand of the Assembly for the early achievement of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
We share the concern of many Members of the Organisation about the possible spread of nuclear weapons to areas of tension such as the Middle East, North Asia or the Korean peninsula. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a vital part of the process of global nuclear disarmament. In this contest, we welcomed the widespread support evident at the recent Review Conference for stronger safeguards to restrict further the possible spread of nuclear weapons. It was a matter of great regret to us that it was not possible to have these and other important gains made by the Review Conference formally adopted in a Final Document. 
It is imperative to take other follow-up action to ensure that those gains are not now lost. It is most frustrating that there has been so little progress on banning nuclear testing, which we see as an important part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty bargain. Nevertheless, the stakes are too high to place this Treaty at risk.
One other aspect of disarmament that is currently the cause of considerable interest in our region is chemical weapons destruction. The decision by the United States and the Soviet Union to destroy most of their stocks of chemical weapons is welcome. Less welcome has been the United States decision to use an atoll in the Pacific Ocean for the destruction of some of its stocks. We certainly understand the need to destroy in site where possible and look forward to the day when existing stocks in our region are no more. But, along with other South Pacific countries, we are concerned that our region must not be viewed as a convenient disposal area far from the crowded cities of the countries which created the armaments. It is the clear view of our region that there should be no further transfer to the Pacific from outside of chemical weapon stocks for destruction. We have therefore welcomed the assurance to this end given to the South Pacific Forum by the United States. We shall continue to resist the idea of our region being used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons or for the dumping or disposal of nuclear or toxic waste. 
The threshold of challenge and of opportunity for the United Nations obliges us all to ensure that our Organisation is equal to new tasks. The system in many aspects reflects another world and another time. In 40 years new and significant players have become active in our world community of nations and their position in the scheme of things does need to be better acknowledged. Old enmities have subsided; divided countries are reuniting. The many smaller countries ponder how their interests are now best preserved in this scene of unprecedented change. 
It is necessary to have a system that better reflects a comprehensive view of our world's security, that allows clear decisions and, most importantly, that encourages faithful observance of agreed conventions. The General Assembly must strive for that, and we must all bear in mind the final beneficiaries of our actions - our children.
At a time when the United Nations is drawing attention to the needs of the children of the world, it is worth reminding ourselves that it is neither the technology nor the resource that is missing in the search to integrate environmental and developmental needs, to create a commonwealth of security for the next generation. What is missing is the political will. We all know that the bizarre reality is that solutions to the real and compelling needs of children, which have been discussed here in the past few days, could be found by reducing the bloated arms budgets of the world.
At this time of such great hope - and such great peril - perhaps we should also remember that those who will inherit our political bequests have simple needs. As we make decisions, choose to act or choose not to act, I would ask the question in the language of the Maori of Aotearoa, the language of my sons 'Ha aha te taonga o Te Ao Gon?' - 'What is the treasure of the new dawn?' And the answer is obvious: 'Nga mokopuna, nos mokopuna. ma mokopuna' - 'It is the children, it is the children'.
"
6389,45,1990,VUT,"﻿I have the honour of speaking today on behalf of the States members of the South Pacific Forum in my capacity as current Chairman of the Forum.
At the outset I extend to you, Mr. President, our congratulations and best wishes on your election to preside over this body. Malta, like most of the countries of our own region, is a small island State. Thus, we take particular notice of the honour that has been bestowed upon you. We extend these congratulations to your Government and people as well.
We also applaud the accomplishments of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly and of the three special sessions of the Assembly conducted under the capable leadership of your predecessor, His Excellency
Major-General Joseph H. Garba of Nigeria. To him, we express our appreciation and offer our congratulations.
I also take this opportunity to extend our congratulations and best wishes to the Government and people of the Republic of Namibia, which has finally been allowed to take its rightful place within the community of nations. Namibia's triumph is a triumph for Africa, for the United Nations and for all of humanity. We also congratulate the Principality of Liechtenstein on becoming the newest Member of the United Nations. We look forward to the constructive contributions its delegation will make.
Today an important chapter of world history closes, and a new chapter begins. The formal establishment of a single German State provides ample evidence that the most lasting ideas and qualities are those that unite rather than those that divide. This should also serve as a reminder that no people can ever be removed from the contest of its history nor permanently barred from the appointed rendezvous with its destiny.
Our congratulations and sincere best wishes are attended to the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Germany on this historic day. Similarly, our congratulations and sincere best wishes are extended to the Government and people of the Republic of Yemen on the recent unification of their country. 
In both instances unification was achieved peacefully and resulted from the will of the people themselves rather than from political edict or Military fiat. Therein lays an important message. It is to be hoped that that message will be borne in mind by those who night mistakenly believe that another path can be followed successfully. Unity, much like love, can only be based on free consent, equality and mutual respect. 
The beautiful and majestic Pacific Ocean comprises almost one third of the Earth's surface. Our corner of that great ocean lies in the South Pacific, which is itself a dramatic study in great contrasts. Nature has endowed us with great natural beauty and a hospitable environment. However, from time to time, our beautiful skies turn cloudy, our clear blue waters become turbulent and our calm tropical breezes become frightening winds of death and destruction. Cur environment is thus a blessing and at the same time a major concern.
Most, but not all, of the countries in our region are small island States which are extremely vulnerable to external economic factors, as well as sudden climatic changes. All of us prefer to live in peace; yet we repeatedly see our lands, our waters and our atmosphere utilised by others to test their horrible weapons of mass destruction. All of us share a deep and abiding commitment to the United Nations and to the principles of international democracy. However, we are often struck by the fact that our concerns - and in some instances our very existence - are often neglected or even forgotten in the context of the larger global picture. In a symbolic sense, some of us on occasion feel as invisible to others as the title of the classic work. The Invisible Man by the noted African-American author, Ralph Ellison.
Although we are island countries, we recognise that, when it comes to economic development and the outstanding social issues of contemporary civilisation, no nation is an island into itself. Some may consider our geographic location to be remote. However, we are very much a part of today's world, just as we were very much a part of the history of yesterday's world. Like the peoples of every other region, we have our own history and our own cultures. We also share common dreams and common expectations, just as we share common fears and common frustrations. 
The South Pacific Forum, our paramount regional organisation, held its twenty-first annual meeting in Port Vila, Vanuatu, on 31 July and 1 August. The region's Heads of Government addressed a number of important political, economic and environmental concerns. These have been set forth in our communiqué, which we have requested the Secretary-General to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly.
That document, A,4S,456, in very brief form sets forth some of our major concerns and preoccupations. However, it does not touch upon every single issue that we believe merits the attention of the international community. For example, we highlighted some of our major concerns on environmental issues, including the very real threat posed to the survival of some Pacific island nations by climatic changes and a rise in the sea-level. However, our very deep concern over nuclear testing in the South Pacific is by now well known to every member of the international community and needs no explicit restatement.
The testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific continues to cause us to fear for the future of our young and for unborn generations. At a time when the threat of nuclear war between the super-Powers is far less likely now than it ever was, we continue to ask: What sin have we committed? Why must our region be the site for the testing of nuclear devices, particularly now that the cold war has ended? So soon after the highly successful World Summit for Children, we are struck by the irony of having to pose the questions How, may we ask, are we to enhance the development of our children unless we can assure them that the environment we bequeath to them is an environment capable of sustaining life?
Another great concern shared by all members of the South Pacific Forum is the planned destruction of existing chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll. Our concerns have been communicated to the Government of the United States, and we are continuing a constructive dialogue with the United States that centres on those concerns. Without a doubt, our central concern is this specific issue and on our broader conviction that our region should not become a permanent toxic waste disposal centre.
On another environmental issue of great importance to the Forum, we have welcomed Japan's decision to cease large-scale drift-net fishing in our region one year in advance of the date stipulated in General Assembly resolution 44,225. This was a very positive measure taken by Japan, and we appreciate its demonstrated sensitivity to our concerns.
France has also demonstrated sensitivity with respect to one of the great concerns of countries in our region. As the international community prepares to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, we are pleased to note the positive measures being pursued in Hew Caledonia by the French authorities. The Forum has urged all parties involved to maintain their dialogue and to continue promoting a framework for the peaceful evolution of New Caledonia towards an act of self-determination consistent with the principles and practices of the United Nations.
The prestige and the structure of the United Nations are now reaching new heights. Accordingly, the objectives of the Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism are clearly within our reach. Therefore, the Forum believes that a visit to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories by the Secretary-General, or a specially designated representative of the Secretary-General, could help facilitate the completion of the decolonisation process. 
Like others, countries of the South Pacific cheered the release from prison of Mr, Nelson Mandela. We have also called upon those who currently govern South Africa to take further steps that would signal a commitment to the profound and irreversible changes necessary to accelerate the process of dismantling the apparatus of apartheid and eliminate its effects. Until such time, the Forum has joined others in calling for the continuation of the functions already imposed against South Africa and exploring other avenues of bringing a rapid end to the system of apartheid. 
That concludes my statement as Chairman of the South Pacific Forum. I shall now make a few observations on behalf of ray own country, Vanuatu.
The recently concluded World Summit for Children was a major diplomatic event of potentially enormous social significance. The initiators and organisers are to be commended. But the true measure of the Summit's success does not lie in the number of words written about the meetings or in the number or perceived importance of the Heads of State or Government who participated in them. Rather, the true measure of the Summit's success will be determined by how rapidly we are able to mobilize the resources necessary to guarantee hope for the children of the world.
Children are often the first victims of war, the first victims of the drug traffic and the most tragic victims of AIDS, malaria and other crippling and fatal diseases. Unfortunately, children are also often the last to realize benefits from new scientific or technological breakthroughs. Let us take this opportunity to change that.
One of the things the nations of the world can do for children, and for everyone else, is to renew our commitment to the rule of law. The recent changes that have swept the entire world from Europe to Africa, to South and Central America, to Asia and to the Pacific demonstrate that there is absolutely no substitute for respect for the rule of law.
Today the attention of the entire world is focused on the Persian Gulf. A larger, militarily more powerful country has invaded and continues to occupy its smaller neighbour. As a result, mankind faces the possibility of yet another war. There will be no winners in such a conflict. There will be only losers. The biggest losers will once again be the children. For many of them, the future will end before it begins. 
The world cannot accept the invasion and attempted annexation of Kuwait. They are acts that defy every accepted norm of international law and offend everyone's sense of decency. The Government of Vanuatu knows of no deed, whether real or imagined, that could conceivably justify the fate that has befallen Kuwait.
We pray that the conflict will be resolved without any further loss of life. However, we know that for this to occur, there must be a remarkable change of course. We harbour no illusions with respect to the difficulties ahead.
The effects of the conflict are already being felt in every corner of the world. Not a single country can escape the consequences of the invasion of Kuwait. Thus, none of us can sit idly by and be spectators. We must attempt to resolve the problem together, or it will consume us all, one by one.
Already the economies of many countries, including our own, have been seriously affected. However, we shall continue to support the principles on which the United Nations is based, for without adherence to those principles that will be nothing but international anarchy. Small countries such ш our own would be particularly vulnerable to the appetites of others.
There is no doubt that the invasion of Kuwait is a tragic occurrence. It is tragic for Kuwait; it is tragic for Iraq and for every other country in the region. It is also tragic for the innocent civilians from all countries trapped by circumstances in Kuwait and Iraq.
One encouraging sign is that there has been almost universal condemnation of the invasion and continued occupation. Had the nations of the world spoken with similar clarity earlier after similar invasions, Kuwait might perhaps have been spared the fate it now faces. Now that the international community has spoken so unequivocally on the invasion of Kuwait, perhaps others will pause to rethink their own actions. 
The situation in the Persian Gulf is not the only current regional tragedy. It is merely the on· now occupying centre stage. The Palestine issue is today no nearer to being resolved than it was yesterday. Lebanon continues to be a bruised and battered victim of an endless cycle of violence. Liberia has been deeply shaken by a particularly violent civil conflict. East Timor’s people continue to be forgotten or ignored by many ,ho now speak forcefully on the Persian Gulf. One can only hope that there will soon be an opportunity for the people of Western Sahara finally to determine their own future.
The potential of a United Nations free of confrontation is highly visible in the progress made towards the settlement of the Cambodia issue. We congratulate the Cambodian parties and encourage them to continue their efforts on behalf of the people of their country, who have suffered so long.
The recently concluded second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries was a success, even though it was not possible to fulfil all the very high expectations of those who participated. France, which hosted the meeting, continues to play a positive role in this area. Gradually, progress is being achieved on some of the key issues. Now we must attempt to implement fully the new Plan of Action.
Since its inception, the South Commission, under the chairmanship of the former President of Tanzania, Julius K. Nyerere, has been diligently analysing the problems faced by developing countries, the strategies adopted for dealing with those problems and the lessons to be drawn from past experiences. The report of the South Commission contains many useful recommendations. Perhaps its greatest value, however, in its clear statement that responsibility for the development of the South lies in the South and in the hands of the peoples of the South. We fully agree. 
In conclusion, I wish to join in commending the excellent work of Mr, Javier Peres de Cuellar, our Secretary-General. Today we stand on the threshold of a new era in international relations. To the Secretary-General and the other members of the Secretariat we offer our thanks for their tireless efforts in helping to bring us to that threshold. Now it is for us, the Member States, to take the final decisive step which will open the door to new opportunities and close the door on all our old hostilities and antagonisms. 
"
6407,45,1990,AUS,"﻿It is with great pleasure. Sir, that I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly, a role for which your extensive experience in international relations, your legal training and your interest in human rights qualify you highly. The excellent relationship between Australia and Malta is of long standing, based on extensive family and community ties as well as on our strong and active membership of the Commonwealth, and we do look forward to working very closely with you. I would also like to join others in extending warm welcome to Namibia and Liechtenstein, the newest Members of the United Nations.
We meet today in the General Assembly on the eve of the recreation of a united Germany, an event which marks, as no other could do so clearly, the end of the post-war era. It is an era which has been dominated by the cold war and nuclear confrontation, but which has also seen extraordinary change: the end of the European colonial empires and the re-emergence of the independent nations of Africa and Asia) the economic reconstruction and ever closer political association of Western Europe; and, starting with the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the specialised agencies of the United Nations, the growth of multilateralism on a remarkable and unprecedented scale.
However, the poet-war era has left for us many problems that still remain to be solved. Iraq's aggression in the Gulf has shown that the habits of millennia are not going to change overnight, and that the arrogance of military power remains a scourge with which the world will still have to deal. 
The scourges of hunger, ill-health, poverty and debt also remain to an intolerable extent, threatening to widen rather than narrow the already alarming gulf between North and South. The scourge of racism, and ethnic and religious hatred, still remains to be purged from many countries and regions. And there is another scourge - the impact of human activity upon the sustaining environment o£ our planet itself - a scourge whose magnitude we are only now beginning to recognise.
The challenge for us all in the new era ahead of us, as relationships, policies and attitudes that had been frozen for so long continue to unfreeze, as the cold war becomes the great thaw, is for us to confront and overcome these scourges once and for all. If that is to happen, we will need, above all else, to develop habits of mind which are co-operative rather than confrontational, and habits of action which are instinctively multilateral. 
Whether the challenge goes to the physical security of nations, the economic health of their peoples, the environmental integrity of the planet itself, or any other problem that no nation can solve wholly by itself. we have to derive inspiration from the thought that we are one world and can each survive only if we can all act collectively.
There is nothing inevitable about the development of any such approach. although events of recent weeks and mouths can certainly give us heart. The trends that will shape the new era are our own to make. Indeed. it is the actions over the next few years of the very men and women who have been assembled in this building over the last week that will launch that era for good or for ill. The world has been given a second chance. and this time we must not again take a false turn.
How we shape the security system of the new era is being comprehensively tested at its outset by the present Gulf crisis. If unity holds in this instance, if the community of nations, acting together under the authority of the United Nations Charter and with the full support of the Security Council, succeeds in demonstrating beyond doubt that aggression does not pay and cannot succeed, then that demonstration effect will weigh heavily on those nations, particularly those with great comparative regional power, which might in the future be tempted to settle disagreements by intimidation and force. If our resolve weakens, the demonstration effect will be equally convincing in its message that the international community is powerless to enforce decisions that we all recognise to be just. Such an outcome is unthinkable.
The crisis in the Gulf can be only resolved on the basis of the conditions set by the United Nations Security Council resolutions being fully and unequivocally met. That is by Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait, the restoration of the legitimate Kuwaiti Government, and the release of all foreign nationals who want to leave. It is Australia's hope that those objectives can be met through the rigorous application of sanctions pursuant to Security Council resolutions 661 (1990), 665 (1990) and 670 (1990). Military-strike action cannot and should not be wholly ruled out at the end of the day should all other means of resolving the crisis fail, but Australia shares the universal hope that sanity will prevail and that a peace without appeasement will be achieved without the horrors of war having to be contemplated.
We can draw both encouragement and hope for the future from tin unprecedented level of international co-operation to meet the crisis, co-operation that has enabled the Security Council to respond promptly and effectively and has restored the Council to its proper central place in international security. The greater willingness of the five permanent members of the Security Council to work together has not only held the line in the Gulf crisis, but has been a crucial factor in what we now hope is the imminent resolution of the Cambodian problem - a problem that not only has involved many years of tragedy for the Cambodian people, but has been a severe ongoing challenge to the security of the South-East Asia region.
A detailed framework for a comprehensive Cambodian settlement has been drafted and agreed by the Permanent Five over the course of this year, and has now been accepted in its entirety by a meeting of the Cambodian parties convened by the Paris Conference co-Chairmen in Jakarta last month. That framework document - baaed in significant part, we are gratified to note, on ideas developed by Australia for an enhanced United Motions role - involves two central components first, the creation of a fully representative Supreme National Council to embody the sovereignty of the Cambodian nation; and, secondly, a role for the United Nations that extends not only to traditional peace-keeping activity and an increasingly common electoral organisation, but also to responsibility for key elements of civil administration in the transitional period pending free and fair elections. The Supreme National Council has been formally established. It will occupy the Cambodian seat in the United Nations, and the process of putting in place a final comprehensive settlement, endorsed by a reconvened Paris Conference, is well under way. A number of matters, procedural and substantive, do remain to be negotiated, and there is bound to be some faltering before the process is complete, but the commitment of relevant countries and parties to finally achieving peace is now such that it is possible, after years of frustration and disappointment, to be much more optimistic than ever before that a durable peace will shortly be achieved.
For some other long-running regional conflicts the outlook is much less, bright. Pre-eminent among them is the Palestinian issue, which, whatever the outcome of the Gulf crisis, will simply not go away until it is resolved in a manner that meets the basic needs and aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis. Australia has consistently expressed support for a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli dispute on the Palestinian issue on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We assert Israel's right to live within secure and recognized borders, but we also acknowledge that of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to an independent State if it so chooses. We regard the proposals for the establishment of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue as a step towards the achievement of a peaceful settlement, and encourage all the involved parties to pursue that dialogue with real and sustained commitment.
One aspect of the issue that continues to hinder the peace process is General Assembly resolution 3379 (XXX) of 1975 equating Zionism with racism. Australia remains strongly opposed to that resolution, which only exacerbates the differences between the parties. We hope that, with the revitalisation of its role and responsibilities in promoting international co-operation, the United Nations will rescind the resolution. 
Another Middle East issue of continuing concern, as we heard earlier this afternoon, is the situation in Lebanon, a country torn apart by conflict for 15 years now. The Taif Agreement, concluded in October last year by the Lebanese themselves with the support of the Arab League, represented a welcome breakthrough. The international community should stand ready to assist Lebanon in achieving peace, but the essential requirement is that there be a commitment from all the parties in Lebanon to national reconciliation, and a willingness to compromise to arrive at a negotiated solution. If anything has become clear over the last 15 years, it is that a lasting solution cannot be imposed by force.
The continuing troubles in Cyprus are another instance of entrenched attitudes making reconciliation extremely difficult. The failure of the attempt to revive the inter-communal talks in February was particularly disappointing. Prospects for progress will remain bleak unless there is a real determination to succeed on both sides and a willingness to enter into negotiations free of pre-conditions. Australia continues to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to promote a negotiated solution, in the belief that that is the route by which a just settlement is most likely to be reached.
That just settlements of apparently intractable problems can be reached with the help of the international community is amply demonstrated by recent events in southern Africa. In Namibia the United Nations mounted one of the most complex peace-keeping operations in its history and played a vital role in guaranteeing the impartiality of the elections and of the transition process. And in South Africa itself the Government has over the past few months at last begun to take steps towards negotiations with the representatives of the majority of South Africans and towards dismantling the repressive and brutal system of apartheid. 
The Australian Government warmly welcomes the statesmanship shown to date by President De Klerk, but urges the South African Government to move as soon as possible into substantive constitutional negotiations and to remove the remaining legislative cornerstones of the apartheid system. More does need to be done before those who have suffered under apartheid and those who support their struggle can be confident that developments in South Africa do constitute profound and irreversible change. We believe that sanctions imposed by the international community have played a central role in bringing about the important changes now under way, and that the sanctions pressure should not yet be reduced or lifted. But we hope the time will rapidly come when it can be. 
For Australia, the South Pacific is also an area of vital interest, and we continue to encourage processes of political development in the region. We are gratified in this respect by the continuing success of the Matignon and Oudinot Accords in creating a constructive and peaceful environment in New Caledonia for the working out of that country's political future. Equally, however, we continue to be deeply disappointed at the backward steps that occurred in Fiji with the events of 1987 and the recent promulgation of a Constitution which, while marking a welcome return to representative constitutional Government, none the less in the process builds new and far-reaching racially discriminatory principles into the Fijian political system.
Two countries in the Pacific which have been frustrated in fully developing a political identity of their own are the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, and Australia believes the United Nations has a constructive role to play in this respect. The full fruits of self-government which should have followed their legitimate acts of self-determination have been denied to then by legalistic approaches to the question of their political status. The continued application of the trusteeship regime to them not only belittles what they have already achieved in establishing independent political identities, but imposes practical disadvantages on them in their pursuit of national development.
If the coming era is to learn from the mistakes of the past, we need not only to find new co-operative ways of resolving regional problems - whether these be potentially global or much more limited in their consequences - but also to tackle with determination and stamina the most alarming global security problems of the cold war era - the upward spiral of arms procurement and the proliferation of increasingly more destructive weapons. That task is all the more important in our increasingly multipolar world. While the progress made by the United States and the Soviet Union in their bilateral negotiations is evidence of super-Power commitment to a more peaceful world, it should also now be complemented by progress in multilateral disarmament negotiations,
We in Australia are proud of our commitment to the process of disarmament and intend to redouble our efforts to capitalise on the current circumstances to achieve specific disarmament goals in the multilateral context, particularly in relation to chemical and nuclear weapons. Significant progress on the achievement of a chemical weapons convention has been made in the last year, but the need to conclude this convention is now greater than ever, and the opportunity to do so must be seized. Australia believes that a decisive step towards this goal would be a ministerial-level meeting of the Conference on Disarmament to be held as soon as possible.
We also continue to work assiduously to eliminate nuclear weapons. Australia is proud of its part, together with the other members of the South Pacific Forum, in the creation of the Treaty of Rarotonga, which has established a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. We will not rest until a comprehensive test-ban treaty has been achieved with appropriate verification procedures. To help move towards that goal, Australia will be once more proposing, with New Zealand and other sponsors, a draft resolution on a comprehensive test ban this year and looks forward again to achieving strong support for it. We would wish this support to be carried over to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, which is the appropriate forum for a comprehensive test ban to be negotiated. We are, therefore, pleased that the Conference on Disarmament has this year re-established an Ad Hoc Committee on a nuclear-test ban, which will provide the opportunity for important preparatory work to a comprehensive test-ban treaty to be undertaken. 
Australia was an active participant in Geneva at the recent Review Conference of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty. Despite the Conference's regrettable inability to adopt a final declaration, we none the loss consider it to have been a considerable success. Reaching agreement, as it did, on a number of important issues, in particular the question of full-scope safeguards as a condition for nuclear supply. We will be working to build on the achievements of the Conference and to set the scene for a successful review and extension of the Treaty in 193S. The non-proliferation Treaty is an absolutely essential foundation on which the new relationships of the coming era must be built.
The acquisition of conventional weapons continues at an alarming rate in many parts of the globe. Often scarce resources are diverted from social and economic development to military expenditure. Australia supports measures by all State· to reduce military budgets and to implement confidence-building measures which will reduce the risk of conflict.
The world community, while it is working together for a future of common security, has a second chance to show its equal determination to create a future of common prosperity. Meeting economic challenges is no less important than meeting security challenges if we are to provide guaranteed life and health for our children, and a fulfilling life for all our citizens.
Australia supports the efforts made by the United Nations in mobilising international support for development efforts. The eighteenth special session of the General Assembly in April highlighted a new sense of commitment and renewed optimism for global economic co-operation. The globalization of economic problems has been accompanied by a growing awareness that their resolution can be achieved only by a sustained international partnership. 
Australia is particularly concerned at the human cost of heavy national indebtedness, which severely compromises development efforts in many countries. Debtors and creditors need to address the issues raised by that indebtedness again in a spirit of international economic co-operation and in a way that addresses not only the immediate but in addition the long-term problems of the nation in question. Debt-reduction packages should be implemented in such a way as to enhance credit-worthiness and new money flows, and to support reform progress in heavily indebted countries.
Australia firmly believes that, whatever may be the contribution of debt reduction and development co-operation programmes, the expansion of global trade is central to economic growth and development.
The Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is fundamentally about creating a more secure, stable and open international economic environment. GATT provides a framework of rights and obligations within which economic ambition can be channelled to the benefit of all countries, and not just the few most powerful. That is why the success of the Uruguay Round is so important. Between now and the final ministerial meeting in Brussels in December, all participants in the negotiations will have to intensify their efforts, and develop more of a spirit of compromise than has so far been evident, if a successful outcome is to be achieved. Nobody should be in any doubt that failure of the Uruguay Round would be disastrous for the world trading economy, for all the developing nations dependent on selling their commodities in the international marketplace and, indeed, for all the people we represent.
In addition to the abiding issues of security and economic development, there is a 'third agenda' of problems now being given much increased prominence in international relations - problem that are either too big for each country to solve individually or which are of a character that global action or global pressure can very much help to solve. In areas such as threats to the global environment, health problems like AXDS, the illicit narcotics trade and the problem of refugees and displaced persons, global interdependence is an omnipresent reality, and Multilateral diplomacy an indispensable necessity. The era which we are entering is Marked by the Multiplication of such problems, and the quality of life of the people we represent will be very Much determined by our ability to solve them.
The global environment is certainly one of the key international issues of the 1990s. We are working towards the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which should deal with these two issues in an integrated way. The Conference will not succeed, however, unless considerably more effort is put into reconciling the conflicts between environmental and economic development policies. The two are not inconsistent: the goal of sustainable development can be achieved. But if the United Nations is to lead international efforts in this sphere, we must stop discussing the processes and start debating the substance. For the United Nations to make the most constructive input into solving these problems, there has to be greater co-ordination between the United Nations environment agencies, such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNKP) and United Nations development agencies, such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). There is no obvious need for more agencies and institutions to deal with these issues; we do used to strengthen our existing institutions and to improve communication and co-ordination between them. 
Australia is a strong supporter of the Antarctic Treaty System which reflects the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and has brought peace. stability and remarkable international co-operation to a very special region of the globe. Moves are sow under way, with strong support from Australia, for the establishment within the Antarctic Treaty System of a far-sighted comprehensive environmental protection regime. One aspect of which would, it is hoped, be a permanent ban on mining and oil drilling within the region, to guarantee once and for all the permanence of its uniquely fragile and irreplaceable environment. I would urge those countries not currently involved in these discussions but interested in promoting environmental protection in Antarctica to join the Antarctic Treaty, for it is only through that framework that an effective regime can and will be put in place.
Two other issues directly and immediately affecting the lives of individual citizens also particularly require concerted international action. The 1990s have been declared the Decade against Drug Abuse. Australia will continue to strive - in multilateral forums, with bilateral assistance, and by domestic action - to reverse the growth of this menace. In the global struggle against the AIDS pandemic Australia has supported the central co-ordinating role of the World Health Organisation and is providing financial assistance to its Global Plan AIDS for the development of national AIDS programmes, particularly in South-East Asia. and the Pacific and Indian Ocean island countries.
Human rights issues generally remain very much part of the new international agenda. The most important factor in establishing human rights in this new era will be the spread of democracy to those parts of the world where democratic and freedom are still unknown. The growth of democracy in Eastern Europe has already seen an encouraging reduction in East-West confrontation in the human rights arena. We have welcomed, in particular, a new spirit of co-operation that has become evident in the Commission on Human Rights.  
Unfortunately, the record in human rights in all too many parts of the world has not been all positive over the past year. Australia is appalled at the treatment of innocent civilians caught up in the Gulf crisis and condemns in the strongest terms restrictions imposed by the Government of Iraq on the freedom of movement of hostages held in that country and in Kuwait. Closer to home, Australia is also concerned with continuing restrictions, on democratic and individual freedom, in both China and Myanmar, and we appeal to all involved in the situation in Sri Lanka to end the cycle of violence which is destroying the fabric of country in that nation. We frankly acknowledge that Australia’s own past is not without blemish in regard to human rights, in particular concerning the treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, we have progressed along the path of rectifying those injustices. We welcome international scrutiny of our efforts and are prepared to engage in dialogue with any interested country at any time on such issues. We take the view that the question of conformity to international human rights standards is not each country's own internal business, but the world’s business.
I said at the outset that, as we move beyond the post-war era, the world has been given a second chance. This body, the United Nations, has also been given a second chance, and we, its Members, have to ensure that it is capable of grasping this opportunity. In many ways, the founders of the United Nations were far-sighted and built structures that will now stand us in good stead. In other respects, it is clear that they could not have foreseen the circumstance of this new era and we should not shy away from change, from discarding of long-established conventions and procedures and from the creation of new structures and new ways of doing things which better suit the new times. Our guiding criterion should be that we wish the United Nations to be effective and to influence events, rather than to be passively shaped and overwhelmed by them.
One area in which demands on the United Nations are obviously likely to grow in the new era is in the performance of conflict resolution and peace-keeping functions. Indeed, already over the past two years, five peace-keeping operations have been established and several others foreshadowed, including, of course, the comprehensive efforts that will be required in Cambodia. The peace-keeping function is still hampered by political, legal, financial and administrative, problems. Australia advocates the need for greater efficiency and economy in peace-keeping and for the whole peace-keeping area of United Nations activity to be put on a firmer financial end administrative footing. I welcome the steps the Secretary-General has recently taken to improve co-ordination and financing of peace-keeping but note that much more still needs to be done.
There is an urgent need to improve the ability of the United Nations, not only to service the demands of its members in regard to peace-keeping and peace-making, but also to deal with the major new issues of global interdependence, of which I spoke earlier. These major issues must be taken up more substantively and effectively than they are currently in the way different intergovernmental forms of the United Nations’ economic and social sector, and this sector needs to be drastically restructured if we are to see the same revival in the economic aspects of the United Nation’s role that we have seen on political issues. Equally there must be better central co-ordination and clearer common purpose among the various agencies and bodies of the United Nations, if each is to play its proper role in attacking Multisectoral problems that can be resolved only if they act together.
As far as the Organisation as a whole is concerned, universal Membership should remain our central principle. In this connection, Australia regards as a relic of the past era the continued absence of the two Koreas from the ranks of United Illations Membership. The Republic of Korea has stated its desire to become a full Member and we support admission of both Korean States either simultaneously or separately.
The resolutions of this organ of the United Nations, the General Assembly, embody the views of the broad membership of the Organisation. We need to make better use of these annual sessions of our general membership. Let us not be reluctant to remove from our agenda many items that are there by custom, and get rid of many time-wasting, if time-honoured, procedures. Let us use this Assembly to set the norms and standards of correct international behaviour in this new era.
The Security Council is showing us how well it can work. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that the world has changed since 194S and that there will be increasing and legitimate pressure to ensure that the membership of the Council better accords with today's realities. In any consideration of restructuring, our principal concern must be for the effectiveness of the Council and we need to be certain that what we do enhances, and does not risk undermining, the efficiency with which the Security Council is currently able to undertake its central role in international peace and security.
The Secretariat, which itself has in the past been the victim of cold war pressure, requires re-examination to ensure that its structures end its methods of recruiting its top people, both men and women, are best suited to the need· of the Organisation in the new era, when the demands upon them will grow ever more immense.
Two years ago, when I first addressed the United Nations as Foreign Minister of Australia, I drew inspiration from the Charter and from the important role my great Australian Labour predecessor, Mr. Herbert Vere Evatt, played in the founding of the United Nations. I continue to carry in my mind his vision as to what this institution he helped create should achieve - peace, justice and decent standards of living for all the peoples of the world.
The nations of the world are now entering a new era of co-operation; we are breaking new ground as we at last accept in full our international responsibility to Met aggression and to resolve regional disputes. And in doing this we have recommitted ourselves and our countries to pursue peace and to end human suffering - not in an ad hoc, almost accidental manner, but as part of a growing international determination that we can make no excuses to our constituents, or to our children, if these goals of peace and development cannot be achieved. 
This Organisation at last holds out to its members the promise its founders envisaged. But that promise will not be self-fulfilling. There is a historic obligation on us, the Members of the United Nations, to take up at this time and build on the new spirit of international co-operation, to bend our efforts to bolster the new multilateral framework for global peace and security, to act vigorously on the economic challenges before us, and to tackle co-operatively all the social, environmental and health issues which demand global remedies. We have another opportunity to put it right and this time that opportunity must not be lost.
"
6408,45,1990,PNG,"﻿On behalf of the Government and people
of Papua New Guinea, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the
forty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that with your able
leadership and guidance the Assembly will deal with its work in a positive and
constructive manner. I also wish to place on record my country's appreciation of
the contribution made by your predecessor, Major-General Joseph Garba of Nigeria,
to the work of the Assembly last year.

We acknowledge that the world of today is highly volatile and interdependent,
and the need for an organization such as the United Nations is more important today
than ever before. New challenges are now being faced within the framework of the
United Nations system. The United Nations, we believe, provide the appropriate
forum ,or the international community to solve problems through consultation and
dialogue, without the need to resort to violence. The achievements, over the
years, of the United Nations system are commendable, particularly in the areas of
disarmament, decolonisation, the environment, economic development, social justice and the maintenance of world peace. The United Nations can contribute further to 
international stability and social harmony, but this can occur only through 
goodwill and with the tolerance and understanding of all member nations. Papua New 
Guinea is committed to the United Nations and what it represents, and will continue 
to play its part in achieving world peace and harmony. 

Complex problems and challenges continue to face us this year, but the 
Assembly is convening at a time of great hope, a time of profound changes in 
relationships between nations. We have witnessed a marked improvement in East-West 
relations, particularly between the Super-Powers. The era of the cold war is 
vanishing, bringing hope, opportunity and, for some, uncertainty. Massive shifts 
in the world political order will invariably be reflected in changing economic 
relationships. 

We acknowledge with satisfaction the comprehensive report by the 
Secretary-General, particularly with regard to the United Nations involvement in 
the achievement of independence for Namibia and progress in negotiations for 
peaceful settlements of regional conflicts in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Western 
Sahara, Central America, South Africa and, more recently, the Persian Gulf. The 
report also addresses other pressing issues such as human rights, drugs, 
disarmament, the environment, trade, finance and debt servicing. 

Although major conflicts and tensions may appear to be peripheral to us in the 
South Pacific, we are not immune to their effects. We feel their impact on our 
economy, our international obligations, and our moral convictions. 

I speak today in full awareness of the international media publicity, both 
positive and adverse, that Papua New Guinea has attracted over the past two years. 
The increased activity in our petroleum and mining sectors, the closure of the 
Bougainville copper mine in May last year and the subsequent unrest in that 
province of our country have focused attention on Papua New Guinea. Unfortunately 
for Papua New Guinea, the Bougainville and law-and-order crises have tended to 
attract more attention than the many positive developments taking place in the 
country. Like many developing countries we have our share of problems, and we are 
addressing them with energy and determination. Initiatives have been taken by my 
government to promote economic growth, to further develop education and training 
opportunities, particularly in tertiary and technical areas, and to generate 
employment and income opportunities. At the same time. we are developing the 
capacity of the public service and strengthening law-enforcement agencies. 

As a result of the closure of Bougainville mine, my government, with the help 
of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international and 
national aid agencies, has developed an integrated structural adjustment programme 
to assist Papua New Guinea through a difficult series of short-term problems. 
Among other things, the programme will ensure that major resources are 
progressively developed for the benefit of the country and its people. 

A first round of negotiations with Bougainville leaders produced an accord and 
the basis for the restoration of services by the national Government to that 
troubled island. My Government is committed to continued peaceful dialogue with 
the people of Bougainville that together we can achieve an amicable settlement 
of the crisis and a return to normalcy. 

The South Pacific Community is made up predominantly of small, island States, 
scattered throughout a vast ocean. For a long time our interests and well-being 
have been accorded the lowest priority by world military and economic Powers. We 
are vitally concerned about our region. Like others, we in the Pacific wish to 
develop under conditions of peace and security. Most Pacific nations depend on a 
small number of agricultural and marine products for their livelihood and export 
income. For these reasons we concluded the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty, 
The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Natural Resources and 
Environment of the South Pacific region, and the Convention for the Prohibition of 
Drift-net Fishing in the South Pacific. We therefore strongly deplore nuclear 
activities and the dumping of toxic waste , which threaten our fragile ecosystems. 
We also view with deep concern wanton exploitation of our resources. 

This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the historic Declaration on the 
Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It also ushers in the 
International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. Papua New Guinea urges 
that the progress of decolonisation should be accelerated and strengthened as part 
of the present favourable disposition surrounding the work of the United Nations. 
We are pleased that positive measures are continually being pursued in New 
Caledonia by the French authorities to provide a framework for a peaceful evolution 
of the Territory towards an act of self-determination and independence. We urge 
that any act of self-determination should be consistent with United Nations
principles and practices, and that all options, including independence, should be open.


In order that a well-informed decision may be made, the Administering Authority and 
others should further expand their assistance for education and training, in 
particular for the Kanak population.  New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the United Nations to continue to
monitor developments in New Caledonia. It is our express hope that the Administering Authority will facilitate regular visits to New Caledonia by inviting visiting missions of the United Nations. 

Apart from New Caledonia, there are other Pacific islands still under the 
shackles of colonialism. It is our hope that the Administering Authorities 
concerned will accord genuine self-determination to these countries. 

We in the Pacific have always been aware of the importance of protecting the 
environment. Indeed, the cultural and physical survival of many of our countries 
depends on the proper management of that environment. The Convention for the 
protection and Development of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South 
Pacific Region, to which I referred earlier, is a clear indication of the 
importance we attach to this issue. 

We are greatly concerned that, in spite of ominous warnings about the future 
of this Earth, expected climatic changes and predictions of dramatic rises in the 
levels of the sea, gases responsible for the greenhouse effect continue to be 
emitted without strict regulation. It is our fervent hope that countries, particularly industrialized countries,  will effect significant cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases, including the establishment of obligatory emission reduction standards. 

We continue to oppose the disposal of toxic waste at sea unless it conforms 
with standards Prescribed under the London dumping convention. 

The United States has taken stringent precautions in destroying chemical 
weapons on Johnston atoll. We take little comfort in suggestions that Johnston 
atoll should be the permanent disposal site for the American chemical weapons 
destruction programme. We urge the United States not to use the facility as a 
permanent site for the disposal of chemical weapons and toxic waste, and I express 
our firm belief that it should be closed done once the current operations have been 
completed. We will also continue strongly to oppose French nuclear testing at 
Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls. 

Pacific islanders have close affinity to the sea, and their dependence upon 
its resources needs no emphasis. Papua New Guinea is, therefore, pleased with the 
progress made on the elimination of driftnet fishing. 
We welcome the decision taken by Japan to cease drift netting a year in advance 
of the date stipulated in resolution 441225. We urge the Government of Japan and 
other distant water fishing nations to enter into negotiations with us on acceptable 
arrangements.
 
Papua New Guinea's desire to participate meaningfully in the resolution of 
regional problems brings us into regular interaction with member countries of the 
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has taken many important 
initiatives, particularly in the South-East Asian region, which we have fully 
supported. 

We would like to acknowledge with satisfaction the leading role that both the 
Soviet Union and the United States have played, in recent years, to reduce tensions 
in the world. Their efforts and those of other States in the United Nations 
Security Council deserve our full support. Papua New Guinea is aware that progress 
made in the search for solutions to problems in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Western 
Sahara, the Middle East, the Korean peninsula and southern Africa is directly 
related to the convergence of views between the super-Powers and the permanent 
members of the Security Council. 

Papua new Guinea welcomes the announcement by Viet Nam to withdraw its troops 
completely from Cambodia. we commend the efforts of the ASEAN group of countries, Australia and the United Nations Security Council, in devising the united formula for the resolution of the Cambodian problem. Papua New Guinea believes that United 
nations involvement is necessary in order to ensure free and fair elections in Cambodia. 


In the Korean peninsula, my Government looks forward to the re-unification of 
North and South Korea. We support initiatives by both nations to reach a peaceful 
re-unification of Korean people, and urge them to continue on the path of 
reconciliation. In the same time, we support the admission of both North and South 
Korea to the United Nations as full Members. We believe this will facilitate 
dialogue and hasten the re-Unification process. 

The question of northern Sahara appears to be nearing resolution. The 
Secretary-General's settlement proposals, announced  on 11 August 1988, offer the 
chance to resolve this thorny issue once and for all. Members of the United 
Nations have a responsibility to see that the people of Western Sahara are able to 
exercise their right to self-determination. Thus, the organization and the 
supervision of a referendum by the United Nations in co-operation with the 
Organization of African Unity must be allowed to take place. 

The situation in the Middle East continues to cause us grave concern. My 
Government has always maintained that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland, 
just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secure borders. These two 
conditions appear to be prerequisites if a lasting solution to this problem is to 
be achieved. 



We have strongly condemned the use of force as a means of solving 
disputes and, in this context, Papua New Guinea continues to be alarmed at and 
condemn Iraq's invasion and continued occupation of Kuwait since 2 August 1990. 
As a member of the United Nations, my Government is committed to supporting the 
trade and economic embargo against Iraq sponsored by the United Nations Security 
Council. We urge all members of this Assembly to continue to co-operate in seeking 
a peaceful solution to this crisis. 

My Government believes strongly that international pressure and sanctions have 
resulted in the gradual dismantling of the apartheid system. Developments in South 
Africa offer reason for guarded optimism. After years of oppression and injustice, 
the creation of a genuine non-racial democracy may at last be a real possibility. 
We have a continuing responsibility to encourage the process of reconciliation and 
democratic reconstruction. 

We are saddened by the recent riots in the black townships involving the rival 
groups of the African National Congress (ANC) and Zulu Inkatha movements, which 
have left so many people dead. It is our firm conviction that sanctions should be 
continued until apartheid is completely dismantled. 

Papua pew Guinea applauds the achievement of Namibia's independence and 
commends all patties who were involved in this exercise. 

There are many changes taking place in the world economy today. The move 
towards a single-market Europe in 1992, regional initiatives such as the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Group and the shift by Eastern European countries towards market-oriented economies have serious implications for developing countries.



 

The continuing global economic recession have had a considerable adverse impact 
on the economic and social well-bring of all nations. Inflation, high interest
rates, a change-rate instability, rising unemployment, slow growth and
protectionism have all taken their toll on our national economies. 

On a positive side, Eastern Europe's economic transition could offer new 
opportunities for developing economies through increased demand for their 
commodities. We believe that closer co-operation between developed and developing countries 
now are more important than ever. The benefits from new markets in Eastern Europe need to be evenly shared if open trading relations are to be 
maintained. The possible harmful impact on the financial resources available to the developing world must be minimised. 

The formation of the Asia-Pacific economic co-operation group is intended to 
develop closer co-operation between countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and also 

to accommodate developments taking place in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. 

The Lome IV Convention, which was signed on 15 December 1989, contains new concepts and ideas, which make it different from the three preceding arrangements. 

Lome IV contains increased financial packages for Africa, Caribbean and Pacific 
(ACP) countries, and includes now provisions for structural adjustments and 
assistance to ACP countries facing severe balance-of-payments difficulties. 

It is of considerable importance to ACP countries that the levels of 
development assistance agreed to in Lome IV remain unaffected by the opening up of 
Eastern Europe's wider contacts in the rest of the world. Any adjustment or restructuring of the world trading and financial system must not adversely affect   the position of the developing countries. The shifting of focus as well as the 
diversion of financial resources for developed countries to Eastern Europe, would 
greatly disadvantage the economies of the developing countries, whose claims to a more equitable distribution of the world's resources have been outstanding for decades. 

It is important that an open world trading system be maintained if economic prosperity is to be distributed  fairly. 

A strengthened general Agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT) is essential if 
we are to provide a stable framework for the expansion of trade, and to make 
possible the full integration of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as developing 
countries, into the global economy. we believe that the highest priority on the
international economic agenda is the need for a successful outcome to the Uruguay 
Round of talks at the end of this year. Difficult political decisions will have to 
be taken in order to achieve far-reaching and substantive results from all the 
items to be discussed at the Uruguay round.  

The remarkable political and economic changes that are taking place between
the super-powers in respect of Central and Eastern Europe, and those that are 
taking place in the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and elsewhere, point to 
the emergence of a new world order , with shifting alliances and economic groupings. 

Papua New Guinea is confident that the United Nations will address these issues and 
devise measures that will allow member States to cope with the uncertainties that 
lie ahead. 

We continue to support the United Nations in its unique role in the resolution 
of conflict, and in the building of a strong framework for international 
co-operation. Over the years we have supported the work of the United Nations 
because we believe it to be vital to the continuing development of a peaceful and 
prosperous world community. 

Finally, we assure you, Mr. President, and the Secretary-General of our 
continued support for efforts to maintain end develop the work of the United Nations.

"
6536,28,1973,AUS,"﻿39.	I would first like to extend to you, Sir, the warmest congratulations of the Australian delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly. There has been for many years now a growing sense of community between us in Australia and our Latin American neighbours across the Pacific Ocean and a developing sympathy, understanding and awareness of our common problems and mutual interests.
40.	The history of the United Nations since 1945 has been marked by outstanding contributions from a series of distinguished representatives from Latin America and none more so than your own. Your profound experience of the United Nations spans two decades, in the second of which in particular you have been able to play a guiding role in a wide range of United Nations activities. It is fitting therefore that we should now have this opportunity of saluting you as President of the twenty-eighth session of the Assembly.
41.	I might begin by recalling that the present Australian Government came into office less than one year ago, towards the close of the last session of the General Assembly. This is thus the first opportunity for a minister of the present Government to appear at the rostrum of this Assembly and explain its broad philosophy and the policies it is pursuing now and for the future. I regard it as a privilege to be here and to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.
42.	I want to emphasize first that those ideals which inspired the Australian delegation in helping to draw up the Charter in 1945 are valid today. At the San Francisco Conference the Australian delegation saw the United Nations as an instrument for peace and for human welfare everywhere. We conceived of its Charter not only as a charter for politicians and diplomats but as one aimed especially at promoting the dignity and well-being of the ordinary man and woman. We saw this Organization as a means for leading dependent peoples towards independence and as a means of eliminating discrimination of all kinds, including discrimination based on race. These are all clearly written into the Charter, and through such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights they have received further expression in this Assembly and in other United Nations organs as the years have passed.
43.	We hold fast to these ideals, and the philosophy that guides the Australian Government today is a positive philosophy of faith in the United Nations, in its enduring principles and in its ultimate capacity to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of all mankind.
44.	We are living at a time of constant change in the international scene, not all of it rapid, not all of it for the better, but much of it directed towards the end that we all ardently wish for, which is peace and security everywhere and the promise of a better life for peoples everywhere. In spite of disappointments and frustrations we can at least sense an atmosphere of relief from old tensions and an easing of old postures. I have in mind the European security pact negotiations, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the various movements towards peace and neutrality in Asia. The international community has been enriched by the full and energetic participation of the People's Republic of China.
45.	On the debit side I need only mention as examples the seemingly intractable situation in the Middle East, the continued fighting in the countries of Indo-China and the recent grievous developments in Chile.
46.	Let me try to identify the main principles and guidelines that set the general direction of Australian policies, and to place them in the context of the United Nations, its purposes and its operations. There have been some changes in Australia's outlook on the world and consequently in its national policies — changes which we have considered necessary and indeed overdue and which reflect our conception of a new and dynamic approach to our domestic affairs and our international relationships.
47.	It was during an earlier period of office of the present Australian Government that the late Mr. Evatt, our then Foreign Minister, took a leading part in the drafting of the Charter. Nobody will claim that the Charter is perfect, but bearing in mind the transformation undergone by the United Nations since 1945, it has proved a remarkably durable and adaptable instrument. At the same time we acknowledge that there is room for modification of some of its provisions to accommodate changes that have taken place in the balance of influence of Member States. We will view with sympathy and support efforts in this direction, while recognizing that there are limits to what can be achieved.
48.	One conspicuous element in Australia's faith in the United Nations is the enduring principle that discussion and dialogue are essential to the work of the Organization. We accordingly welcome as a major development the decision that, after a lapse of three years, the question of Korea should come under scrutiny and discussion in this Assembly.
49.	Australia, as a member of the United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] in Seoul, has been seeking to prepare the ground so that the Assembly's handling of the Korean question may help to lessen tension, facilitate accommodation and improve the prospects of Korean reunification. UNCURK itself has taken a timely initiative in recommending, in its annual report to the Secretary-General [A/9027], that it should now be dissolved. Australia's efforts have been directed towards promoting conciliation and consensus on the Korean question. We wish to ensure that the renewal of the Korean debate should not be a polemical confrontation which would only be detrimental to the spirit of harmony and good relations which we are seeking to promote. We hope that the parties will be able to adjust to each other's positions without trying to push each other into a corner, and that the Assembly will arrive at a constructive consensus.
50.	We have been active in extending our bilateral relationships throughout the broad region to Australia's north and east. In addition to establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China we have moved quickly to establish diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Viet-Nam and have begun trade and other exchanges with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We have at the same time sought to broaden and deepen our long established relations with the other Asian and Pacific countries including t he group of States members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and our close neighbour, Indonesia.
51.	This twenty-eighth session of the Assembly marks a further notable step towards the attainment of the ideal of universality of membership of the United Nations. My delegation has been most happy to welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, both of which now have diplomatic relations with Australia. Their presence here is a symbol and a measure of lessening ideological tensions and a re-endorsement of international coexistence.
52.	We also warmly welcome to membership in the United Nations the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, which on its attainment of independence earlier this year we have already welcomed as a fellow member of the Commonwealth of nations.
53.	We in Australia have been sufficiently encouraged by the recent progress in negotiations among the countries of the south Asian sub-continent on their difficult and complex problems to hope that the remaining obstacles may soon be removed to the admission of another Commonwealth country, Bangladesh, to membership in the United Nations.
54.	Our Government is deeply conscious that to realize the full benefit of our philosophy we must eliminate some of the heritage of the past, such as colonialism and racism, before the welfare of people around the world can be improved. Australia believes that it can take some modest credit for its part in ensuring that the chapters on economic and social welfare were included in the Charter. Those chapters provide the United Nations with the incentive and the means to advance human welfare and to adapt international action to the needs of the present. We know that some of the paramount objectives have fallen far short of achievement. We have poverty in most of our Member countries. We do not have the stability in trade and financial relationships among United Nations Members that we would like. But we have the means available to us to formulate solutions to the problems of the developing countries and to the problems of stability among all countries. The Australian
Government believes that we should utilize these means to the full.
55.	Our Government's purpose of promoting human freedom, human dignity and human welfare calls, of course, for domestic as well as international action. We aim to enlarge welfare and social security and especially to protect the more exposed sections of our community. We are concerned not only with welfare in the broad sense but also with removing discrimination and with looking after those, of our people, including particularly our aboriginal people, who have suffered from discrimination in the past.
56.	During the present Assembly we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. This anniversary of one of the most significant and enlightened achievements of the United Nations gives governments an opportunity to rededicate themselves to the promotion of human rights in their own societies and internationally.
57.	It is a fundamental objective of Australia's approach to ensure that our own policies are soundly based on respect for and the protection and enhancement of civil liberties and basic human rights. When our present Government came to power, it immediately began to examine all the international instruments concerned with human rights with a view to determining what action we should be taking to give effect to them. Already this year Australia has ratified a number of Conventions of the International labour Organisation dealing with the right to organize and bargain collectively, equal remuneration for men and women, and the elimination of discrimination in the fields of employment and occupation. We have put in hand action to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
58.	Respect for human rights and opposition to discrimination lead naturally to positive support for the process of decolonization.
59.	The Australian Government supports the principle of decolonization for all dependent territories and is participating fully in the efforts of the international community to induce the metropolitan administering Powers to take all steps necessary to ensure that peoples in dependent Territories are enabled to exercise their right to self-determination. Suiting the action to the word, Australia in January of this year rejoined the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, of which we had been an original member.
60.	The most acute of the colonial problems remain centred on southern Africa, although the processes of decolonization are still to be worked out in many other areas as well. I have personally had the honour to be received with notable hospitality and generosity in seven African countries during visits undertaken to further Australian sympathy, knowledge and understanding of African problems.
61.	We have been working as a member of the Security Council for the strict enforcement of sanctions against the illegal racist regime of Zimbabwe. Indeed, we see these sanctions as a test of the sincerity of Member nations to act in accordance with the principles and obligations of the Charter. We in Australia are determined to enforce them in full, and we will continue to deny the illegal regime any recognition or respectability.
62.	We also see as a test of the sincerity of Member nations their attitude to the intolerable practice of apartheid in South Africa. This is a practice which we utterly reject. We shall continue to take every opportunity to condemn it and to co-operate with all those seeking responsibly to eliminate it.
63.	We understand the frustrations that have led the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the non-aligned countries to adopt the position that armed struggle is essential to end colonialism and racial discrimination. While we sympathize with the aims of the national liberation movements in southern Africa, we ourselves stop short of endorsing the use of force to attain these and indeed any other objectives. We hope that, through the application of the principles of the Charter, liberty and equality may be achieved without the tragedies of war.
64.	Australia values its continuing co-operation with the Special Committee and the Trusteeship Council in the Territories for which Australia is still the administering Power.
65.	Our principal residual responsibility as an administering Power rests in Papua New Guinea, the largest and most populous Territory remaining within the United Nations Trusteeship System. The termination of the Trusteeship Agreeement is now in sight. In close co-operation, the Government and House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea and the Australian Government are moving purposefully to bring Papua New Guinea to sovereign membership in the family of nations.
66.	Since 30 April 1973 the ministers of the Papua New Guinea Government have had effective control over virtually all aspects of the internal government of the country. Formal self-government will come on 1 December this year; certain policy functions such as defence and foreign affairs will not, for constitutional reasons, be transferred until independence, but these functions are already being exercised by Australia only after the fullest consultation with, and advice from, the Government of Papua New Guinea.
67.	Earlier this year the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly affirmed its right as the duly elected parliament of the people to decide when independence is to come. The Australian Government acknowledges that, on the question of independence as on the question of self- government, the House of Assembly should give effect to the wishes of the people. We expect Papua New Guinea to proceed to sovereign independent status by 1975 as a politically unified nation with a freely elected central government. We have pledged substantial and comprehensive help to the Government and people of an independent Papua New Guinea, which will naturally have a special place in the affections of the Australian people and in our network of political and other relations. Australia is not seeking any exclusive relationship with Papua New Guinea, which will want to find its own place in the international community.
68.	The principle that well-to-do countries have an obligation to help those that are poorly off ranks high in the estimation of our Government, and we have taken a fresh look at our policies and programmes of development assistance with the aim of making them more sensitive and responsive to the requirements of the developing countries . To that end we have decided that there should be a separate government agency to administer Australia's development assistance programmes. We intend that our programmes of bilateral assistance should be increasingly directed to activities that will have the effect of spreading social and employment benefits.
69.	We are also particularly conscious of the wish of developing countries to increase their exports and to bring bilateral trade more into balance. Our recent decisions to effect an across-the-board 25 per cent reduction in tariffs and to revalue the Australian dollar for the second time in nine months taken together represent a constructive attempt to play our part in liberalizing international trade. The tariff cuts are to be accompanied by significant new tariff preferences for imports from developing countries, which will greatly extend and elaborate Australia's scheme of generalized preferences first introduced in 1966. We are also giving improved technical assistance to developing countries to help them exploit their opportunities in the Australian market.
70.	The current financial year will see an increase in all of Australia's major economic and technical aid programmes, and we are now for the first time giving vigorous support to the efforts of the United Nations in the population field. Although, as before, Australian aid will continue to be channelled mainly to the countries of Asia and the Pacific, we will next year be making increases in allocations to African countries as well as in our contributions to the major United Nations and other multilateral funds. Australia accepts the principal target of the International Development Strategy and will aim to raise its official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product.
71.	In the past, Australia has taken a cautious approach to the question of the link between the special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and development assistance. The present Australian Government supports the studies on this matter undertaken within the IMF Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues since we are conscious that the overwhelming majority of developing countries believe that their interests would be significantly advanced by some form of link.
72.	Australia shares the deep concern expressed during this general debate about the world food situation. Our Government is determined that Australia should make a positive and constructive contribution to the international efforts to alleviate the distress and hardship resulting from this situation. Accordingly, Australia has reacted favourably to the proposal by the Secretary of State of the United States that the Assembly should consider organizing a world food conference in 1974 [2124th meeting, para. 71]. We have noted that the essence of Mr. Kissinger's proposal is similar to that in the action programme for economic cooperation adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries [see A/9330 and Corr. 1, p. 99], which advocates the convening of an emergency joint conference of FAO and UNCTAD on this problem. Australia is flexible about the procedure for organizing the conference, but we are determined to join with others to find the most suitable, the most immediate and the most efficient way of bringing the attention of the international community to the problem of the world food supply with a view to reaching a practical agreement on the way in which it could be rationally and humanely managed.
73.	The principles which guide Australia's policy of active support for the United Nations through the protection and enhancement of human rights, through opposition to colonialism and racism and through acceptance of the obligation to help those who are poorly , off are all part of a Central concern with the kind of life that our people can enjoy and with the kind of environment in which they are to live. The first responsibility for maintaining a congenial environment for mankind's working and leisure hours must rest with our own and other individual Governments, and Australia for its part is now equipped with an administrative apparatus which is being geared to take sensitive account of our people's interest in maintaining the quality of their surroundings.
74.	But there is also much that countries can learn from one another. Placed as we are in a large island continent offering wide extremes of climate and terrain, we believe that we have some experience of our own which we can share with the international community in return for the lessons we can learn from abroad — experience in combating air and water pollution, in preserving our natural heritage and in contributing generally towards a satisfactory, and indeed an improving, quality of human living.
75.	And so from the beginning, Australia took a lively interest in the proceedings of last year's United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm. We have declared our support for the achievements of that Conference, and intend to pursue policies that accord fully with the Stockholm principles. We are also contributing substantially to the United Nations Environment Programme.
76.	The proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons are clearly incompatible with the outlook of any Government and people concerned with the quality of life. These activities divert into unproductive channels the resources, energies and skills which could much more profitably be expended on programmes for the political, economic and social development of the international community.
77.	Australia ratified the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty in 1963, and our Government, this year ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] and the sea-bed arms control Treaty.  Australia pledges its full support to the efforts of the United Nations to achieve general and complete disarmament subject to effective means of verification, and our Government is now taking steps to ratify the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)].
78.	We find it deeply regrettable that the Governments of two nuclear Powers have continued to conduct nuclear- weapons testing programmes in the atmosphere, with associated hazards for present and future generations, despite the repeated expressions of disapproval by the United Nations and other international bodies and by individual countries. I take the opportunity to recall that on 22 June last the International Court of Justice gave an order for interim measures to restrain the Government of France from conducting atmospheric nuclear tests in the Pacific which would deposit radio-active fall-out on Australia. 
Australia is opposed to all forms of nuclear-weapons testing in any environment by whatever State, and we fully endorse the statement by the Secretary-General that 'the time has now surely come for a general agreement to stop all nuclear-weapons testing'.
79.	The air and seas of our planet are accessible to all the nations of the world. Just as the international community cannot tolerate misuse of the earth's atmosphere for any purpose whatever, so we must try to ensure that the oceans are not misused.
80.	The United Nations has been grappling for almost three years now with the task of preparing for a comprehensive conference on the law of the sea. The fact that progress has not been as rapid as we might wish is a measure of the importance of the subject and of the diversity and complexity of interests that will have to be accommodated in the new system of law.
81.	As a matter of priority, the General Assembly must at this session review the progress of the preparatory work and confirm the decisions it took at its last session to convene the conference in 1973-1974. Australia, as a coastal State with interests in every aspect of the law of the sea, has a concern second to none in achieving agreement on a satisfactory convention. We hope that the Assembly, with an appropriate sense of urgency, will reach early agreement to convene the organizational session of the conference later this year and the substantive session in 1974.
82.	Few delegations at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 could have envisaged the radical transformation of the United Nations that has taken place. The vast majority of the world's people are now represented here. Australia is encouraged by this remarkable achievement and by the work of the United Nations in promoting the fundamental principles of peace and human welfare. We intend to be as active at home as internationally in giving effect to the basic principles of this Organization. If, as we hope, we are now entering a more promising era of reconciliation, accommodation and peace in international affairs, the United Nations will be able to muster great energies and to concentrate more effectively on the economic and social problems of development and on improving the quality of life everywhere. Those noble purposes call for renewed dedication, unstinting co-operation and a ceaseless effort from every Member of this Organization, and we in Australia are determined to provide all three."
6547,28,1973,NZL,"﻿60.	Mr. President, it is no mere duty but a real pleasure for me, in coming to the rostrum, to pay a tribute to you, the distinguished representative of Ecuador, and through you to the great Latin American community. I greet your country also as a good Pacific neighbour in the southern hemisphere, and we express the hope that every success will attend your efforts.
61.	This is a session of the Assembly at which we will be assessing the growing relaxation of tensions and the breaking down of the old barriers between East and West.
62.	The debates and the welcome action taken here on new Members are, of course, both a symbol and a practical result of these developments. But other results of the new relationship among the great Powers have still to be translated into practical benefits for the smaller countries and for this Organization. That new great Power relationship, that relaxation, has been brought about by a concert of convenience among the few. But we, the smaller nations, who need stable peace, co-operation and international order cannot rest satisfied with such a temporary and fragile situation. We have to find a way to build upon the relaxation, to bring it within a larger, more constructive and more permanent framework of international order.
63.	A 'balance of power' among the great Powers has doubtless contributed to the new spirit of relaxation in international affairs; and to that extent we of course welcome it. But we are not naive. 'Balance of power' in the past has been merely another term for the continuation, in a different guise, of competition and rivalry. The great Powers have continued their efforts to shift the balance in their direction; and in due course they have miscalculated, the balance has collapsed and major wars have occurred. In so far as similar elements are inherent in the present situation the world will continue unstable and the detente will be fragile. For, let us not forget, the great Powers still remain free to undertake their unilateral actions. And some of those unilateral, often sadly misguided, actions have brought great suffering in recent years and set back the progress of wide sections of the whole human family. In this nuclear age unfettered freedom on the part of the more powerful members of the family of nations is too dangerous. The great Powers are beginning at last to show signs of recognizing this. We, and they, in their interests as well as ours, must move to repair the damaged structure of international order. They are establishing some sort of balance among themselves; our task is to build a framework for a healthier relationship between the so-called great and the small.
64.	As the head of a newly elected Labour Government, I come to the international scene new; but the needs of the day seem startlingly obvious. Leaving aside the question of international security and international order, the chief need among nations is the same as the chief need within individual nations  —  that is, to achieve economic and social justice. That is the principal concern of my own Government at home; and I am convinced that it must also be the focal concern of the United Nations.
65.	We view with profound concern and dismay a situation in which, more than a quarter of a century after the United Nations was founded, the most critical of issues show no sign of improvement. I refer to the immense and growing gap between standards of living in the industrialized countries and the developing countries. I refer to the world food situation, which is more difficult than at any time since the aftermath of the Second World War. I refer to the rapidly multiplying world population and the other pressures on available resources. These are the obvious ills of international society, complicated still further by an international monetary instability that jeopardizes the development plans of all countries, by the rapid price inflation in much of the world and, this year, by crop failures and famines.
66.	We are in no doubt about the need to tackle more seriously the deepening division between the rich and the poor. It is depressing and deplorable  —  indeed it is intolerable  —  that most of the international conferences of the last decade or more have ultimately evolved along lines dividing the developed from the developing and in ways and with results in some cases which have reflected no credit on countries which were better off than others. Somehow-and sooner, not later  —  resources must be more equitably shared.
67.	A few countries, a minority of the human family, are using the bulk of the world's resources-resources which we now increasingly realize are exhaustible. Yet, ironically, the ever-increasing consumption of these resources is steadily bringing less and less real enjoyment to the favoured few. An increasing number among them are realizing the dead end  —  the literal dead end  —  of a philosophy and a way of life favouring the accumulation of material things to the point of greed and senselessness. It is a philosophy that in its time brought immense material benefits; but the cost to society of its pursuit to excess is now being plainly revealed. Rich countries, at some time, must appreciate that enough is enough. The richer countries must turn consciously towards improving the more intangible qualities of life for themselves while making their energies and skills available to improve, to a far greater extent than ever before, the material level of life for the majority of poorer countries.
68.	I mean, in other words, that a change in attitudes is required. If not, we run the risk that solutions will impose themselves by means of famine, pestilence, the exhaustion of resources and every form of social unrest and war. There is no need to manage so foolishly the resources of this beautiful planet. If this smacks of Idealism I make no apology for it. If there are no ideals there is no hope. We could do with more of the idealism with which we entered the post-war era  —  an idealism which has been pressed out by the weight of paper and speeches and resolutions and, yes, by the many sobering practical experiences of the last 28 years. One could, I can see it. be disillusioned and cynical. But it is imperative that we should act as if we believe the human race has a future. This may be idealistic, but I am not talking idealism, I am talking practicalities. The world has to move on to new courses if we are to survive. It is a matter of practical common sense.
69.	My Government, since taking office, has been trying to put its convictions into effect  —  though I speak in no boastful way, for I am conscious of how small our efforts are when measured against the needs of others. But we are trying to translate into international terms the vision of a decent and humane society which motivates our domestic policies. We have reviewed our mutual assistance programmes against the internationally accepted targets which now form part of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. We did so because it seemed to us that there was no greater or more urgent priority confronting us in international affairs  —  at least among those priorities which we, as a non-great Power, were in a position to do anything about. We were especially concerned about the possibility of failure of the Strategy for the Second Development Decade implicit in the decision of many countries to maintain reservations about the targets of the Strategy. In a world where millions continue to go hungry New Zealand has not felt able to rest on its achievements despite a steady growth in the size of our aid programme in absolute terms.
70.	My Government has therefore withdrawn previous reservations  on the Strategy targets. We shall seek to meet them. Notably, we have drawn up a programme of government aid which aims to increase more than threefold the existing flow of aid over the next three-year period. We hope to play our part through membership in the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme next year in ensuring expanded and equitable policies of United Nations aid for countries in need of it.
71.	The process of working to improve conditions of life can never be one-sided; it is a mutual one. In the South Pacific in particular and in South-East Asia, which are areas of close interest to us, we look forward to continued co-operation with the countries of the region. Their resources and skills and the efforts of their peoples are an all-important factor and will deserve the major credit for success if the Second Decade's targets are gained. We have seen the way self-government and independence have drawn forth those skills in small South Pacific territories for which New Zealand was once responsible  —  Western Samoa and the Cook Islands. We look forward to the same constructive development and co-operation in the case of the island of Niue, whose representatives will be discussing their plans with you at this session.
72.	What I have been saying grows out of my Government's strong feeling of the necessity-and, one can say increasingly, the inevitability-of social cohesion in the world today. This is not a unique notion of Labour Governments everywhere, but is rather the root idea of the United Nations Charter itself. We are all part of the one human family. Some of us welcome this, but the plain fact is that all of us have no choice but to adjust ourselves to this central fact of human existence.
73.	Obviously a great deal more than aid is needed. Action has to be undertaken on many fronts. For instance, we heard with interest the proposal of the Secretary of State of the United States of America for a world conference on food [2124th meeting]. Such a proposal naturally interests a country like New Zealand, which is deeply involved in the production of food, and we welcome it. But immediately we consider such a proposal we realize afresh how interconnected all the problems of the world are. People are hungry, but in some countries farmers are paid not to produce, and land is taken out of production. Other food-producing countries, like ours, have difficulty in getting access to northern hemisphere markets, because agricultural arrangements have been established which have nothing to do with efficiency but a lot to do with politics and protectionism. Unless fanners can sell their products at fair prices more food is not likely to be produced. Without freer trade in agricultural products it will be difficult lo get Imore food to the people who need it. Thus we hardly start to talk of food before we are face to face with the fundamental issues raised by the new round of negotiations among the States parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And the GATT round takes us to a series of other interconnected issues. Yet the basic problems are not really mysterious at all or incapable of resolution if the will is there. Somehow the resources of this planet and the needs of the human family have to be matched. It can be done and it can be done in a way that would benefit all and harm very few.
74.	Both the proliferation of nuclear weapons generally, and the testing of nuclear weapons and devices in the atmosphere, notably in the. South Pacific, have caused New Zealand deepest concern. We view with disquiet the whole attitude of mind by which nuclear weaponry is preserved and indeed fortified as the years go by. In every way possible  —  by protests to the Governments concerned, by action in the General Assembly, by application to the International Court of Justice  —  we have made every effort to bring about the cessation of nuclear testing. But ,the testing in the Pacific zone has still persisted.
75.	In the more general context we have heard with dismay recently of the reported acquisition by the Soviet Union of a more advanced weapons delivery system which will increase the danger of a new round of nuclear weapons escalation. This news underlines the urgency of achieving further progress in disarmament.
76.	This Organization has recently marked the tenth anniversary of the partial test-ban treaty. But there have been more explosions on the average each year since the Treaty was signed than in the years of the nuclear age that preceded the Treaty. Testing continues unabated. Two nuclear Powers have deliberately ignored the Treaty and have continued with intensive programmes of nuclear testing in the atmosphere, with scant regard for the environment in which we all live or for the growing outcry from world opinion. The remaining nuclear Powers which are parties to the Treaty have continued with underground tests, thereby affording the two Powers that are not party to the Treaty with a pretext for pressing ahead with their own programmes. There has been a lamentable lack of progress in the preparation of a Treaty which would impose a comprehensive ban on all testing, in spite of the undertaking contained in the preamble to the 1963 Treaty to work for such an agreement.
77.	In the absence of a comprehensive agreement, accepted by all the nuclear Powers and backed by the overwhelming weight of world opinion, there must remain an acute and continuing danger that still more countries will seek to acquire nuclear weapons. The proliferation of nuclear weapons - measurably advances the certainty of nuclear war, and only a universal ban on weapons testing can eliminate this grave threat. I am convinced that the people of every country are sick of war and the threat of war. They do not want nuclear weapons and their attendant threats. They want peace and they want more progress towards it. Is it impossible for Governments to be moved by the desires of ordinary people?
78.	Just as we shall not solve the problems of pollution, or the exhaustion of the planet's resources, or the growing gulf between the rich and the poor, unless we change our attitudes towards the accumulation of things, so we shall not solve the problems of war and of international order unless we change our attitudes towards power and the accumulation of power. Arms are the potential for war, for mass slaughter, for the human family to destroy itself. Let us keep in the forefront of our thinking a conviction that war is now unacceptable as an instrument for achieving national aims.
79.	Might we not then deduce the consequences of this truth? Shall we continue to recognize nations as 'great Powers' merely because they have the capacity to inflict greater damage than any other nation? Of course if they acted, under the Charter, as protectors of the human family, they might be so recognized; but in the last 28 years they have demonstrated convincingly their incapacity to rise to such a role; they have failed to match power with responsibility. Sometimes the shepherds have preyed upon the sheep. Might we not therefore respond by questioning the scale of values that puts power at the top? Might we not insist on a different scale of values, a human scale, a civilized scale, a scale based on the belief that the truly great country is the country which shows concern for the quality of life both of its own people and of its neighbours? We have to eliminate the very institution of war from international dealings. Let us therefore start adjusting our attitudes and bring that changed approach to this very Organization. In that way we might prepare the ground for the changes which are required if the United Nations is to meet the needs of human beings here and now and in the challenging years immediately ahead of it.
80.	For-and do we doubt it? -so long as the old attitudes persist, so long will those nations that aspire to so-called greatness strain and swell themselves to reach the critical bulk and dignity. To attain the honour of sitting at the 'top table' they will waste natural resources and cause damage and concern to their neighbours. But let us see for what it is the absurdity of a lonely few sitting at their top table with their obscene weapons which they can use only by committing suicide. That 'honour' is surely now an empty one-if it ever was otherwise. Let us develop values that are relevant to the real world and get to grips with the real business of mankind.
81.	In the case of at least one of the great Powers many citizens are realizing the basic truth about power in the nuclear age and are moving to work out its implications. But in the meantime, what do we, the smaller Members of the United Nations, do  —  we whose requests and pleas are arrogantly brushed aside, perhaps not even listened to?
82.	The small Powers should demand a more effective voice in disarmament negotiations. Let us begin at this session of the Assembly with a concerted call for the earliest possible conclusion of a treaty to ban all forms of nuclear-weapons testing. If no significant progress is made through the existing machinery within one year, the Assembly should, I suggest, consider calling a general conference to draft such a treaty.
83.	We have also to confront the simple fact that in the last 10 years or so international law and international organizations have been the casualties of the cold war. We face a desolate landscape within the United Nations. Some Powers have either ignored the United Nations or brought threats to it only when diplomacy had failed and it was too late for the United Nations to act effectively. How often have they then blamed the United Nations and justified their own unilateral actions by its alleged ineffectiveness? It is now for the smaller countries to take up the task of making this Organization work. If the great Powers will also show a change of approach, the United Nations, and mankind with it, will get back into business.
84.	I have already mentioned the possibility of a concerted call for a treaty to ban all nuclear-weapons testing. The small Powers may also wish to consider carefully the possibilities of partial disarmament or demilitarization on a regional basis where circumstances and geography make it appropriate. One of my Government's first acts after election last year was to change New Zealand's vote at the Assembly in order to express its sympathy with the concept of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. At the Conference of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Ottawa in August, New Zealand joined in a unanimous endorsement of the action of the Foreign Ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in adopting a declaration to make South-East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. In the words of the Commonwealth communique of 10 August 1973, we regard that initiative as a positive contribution towards peace and stability in that region. New Zealand looks with favour also on the establishment by treaty of nuclear-free zones such as that accorded by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco), and we intend to consult with our Pacific neighbours about the feasibility of establishing a similar kind of nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific region.
85.	In the field of the settlement of disputes the small nations could achieve gains by showing a readiness to submit disputes to the International Court or to arbitration. There is a disturbing tendency for some influential countries to pay lip-service to the importance of international law and the role of the Court, but in practice to take all possible steps to avoid its jurisdiction. The more countries that accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court the more internationally unacceptable such evasive practices will become and the greater will be the pressure for the unreserved acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction.
86.	Small nations can help to prevent wars and to assist the peaceful resolution of tense situations by strengthening the peace-keeping role of the United Nations. They can do this by earmarking units on which the United Nations may call for peace-keeping purposes. My own Government has decided to train units of its defence services in readiness for participation in future United Nations peace-keeping operations. Small nations may, I believe, express justified disappointment at the lack of progress hitherto recorded by the Assembly's Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. Recognizing the valuable contributions made by Canada and one or two other members, they should press for the completion of the Committee's mandate set out in resolutions dating from 1967. There is no doubt that the Secretary-General must be given moral and practical support in the initiatives he may have to take in the exercise of his responsibilities in regard to peace and security.
87.	If we think of ourselves as a single family, and if we are going to work together for economic advancement, for the prevention of pollution and other ills, and to escape the threat of war, it follows that we must work together on racial discrimination, which is, justly, one of the major preoccupations of our Organization. This has been a year in which a number of situations affecting human rights have constituted gross affronts to the ideals of the United Nations. In some countries with serious racial problems great efforts have been made and substantial progress achieved in the direction of racial equality, as has happened, for example, in our host country during the lifespan of the United Nations. In other countries racial segregation continues, notoriously, to be enshrined in government policy. In still other countries members of a racial minority who wish to emigrate are subject to onerous conditions and delays, and in yet* another country, members of a racial group have been expelled at short notice and stripped of their possessions without compensation. To these and other situations the response of the United Nations membership has varied widely; some have virtually ignored them.
88.	My own Government is opposed to racial discrimination and oppression no matter where it is practised, by whom, or in whatever form. We have been combing through United Nations resolutions and taking whatever action is appropriate to ensure that our own house is in order. Above and beyond those obligations we have voluntarily accepted a visit from a United Nations representative investigating the problems of indigenous populations. New Zealand is, as far as I know, the first country to show a United Nations mission all aspects of its internal racial situation. We hope that the report of this mission shortly to be presented  will be of value not only to New Zealand but to the United Nations as a whole.
89.	In concert with others, New Zealand will work towards re-establishing the Organization as a protector of the interests of the majority of States, and in particular of the small States. The calls for justice and equity made by the huge new membership must be listened to and heeded. The aspirations of the smaller Powers, their fears, their determination to build a world without war, a world where the rule of law prevails, a world where the weaker will not be subservient to the political and economic interests of the stronger-these demands cannot be ignored. We agree with the Secretary-General that we need action, innovation and determination if mankind is not to be overtaken once again by the dark destructive or selfish side of human nature. We are eager to play our part in creating a true family of man.
"
6724,49,1994,MHL,"Allow me at the
outset to congratulate the President of the General
Assembly on his unanimous election. It is indeed a great
21


honour for his country. I can assure him of my
delegation’s willingness to assist him in his duties.
Let me also congratulate His Excellency Ambassador
Samuel Insanally of Guyana on the exemplary manner in
which he carried out his duties. His innovative use of
expert hearings on the question of development were
followed closely by the Marshall Islands delegation.
My compliments are also extended to our
distinguished Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom we thank for his tireless
efforts on behalf of this Organization.
On a more sombre note, I wish to extend the
condolences of my Government, delegation and people to
our neighbours in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea and
Japan, which have both recently experienced devastating
volcanic eruptions. Our prayers go out to the peoples of
both countries in the hope that they will be able to make a
speedy recovery.
Further grim descriptions and graphic pictures of the
terrible loss of life on the high seas in the sinking of the
'Estonia' have been occupying the air waves and television
screen. We should like to express our deepest sympathy
and condolences to the affected families and Governments
over this tragic accident.
We now wish to join other delegations in welcoming
South Africa to this Organization. The struggle of its
people with racial inequality resulting from apartheid was
long and difficult, often resulting in the loss of precious
lives. We share their excitement in finally joining the
concert of nations.
We also wish to congratulate our neighbour the
Republic of Palau on attaining its independence on 1
October this year.
The aftermath of the cold war has made it necessary
for the United Nations to take on many challenges. The
Organization itself has become involved in several
ambitious undertakings in innovative international relations
and multilateral actions. We hope that these new
endeavours of partnership will produce lasting solutions to
many of our global problems.
That very partnership is evident by the work being
undertaken on the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, which is viewed with great interest in
the Marshall Islands. Currently, we are working together
with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), of
which we are a founding member, in introducing a new
protocol to the Convention. We commend the Chairman
of the Alliance of Small Island States for her coordinating
work in the International Negotiating Committee. In
addition, we welcome the urgent call made by the
German Foreign Minister for more immediate reductions
in carbon dioxide emissions. The German Government’s
support for the AOSIS protocol is most gratifying. We
hope that the Conference of the Parties will adopt the
proposed protocol to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change on Greenhouse Gas
Emission Reduction next year in Berlin.
As an island nation, the Republic of the Marshall
Islands regarded the adoption by the General Assembly at
its forty-eighth session, earlier this year, of the Agreement
relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as historic and
of great importance. We view this Agreement as a
positive step in bringing order to the exploitation of
marine resources. In this vein I am happy to announce
that we will sign that Agreement at this session. We are
also happy to note the imminent entry into force of the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in
November this year.
In the months leading up to the Barbados
Conference last April, we were very confident that at last
the international community would try to do something
positive for the small island developing States, a group of
countries that we feel has been neglected. We are
pleased that we now have a Programme of Action, and
we will do our utmost to seek its successful
implementation to enhance our island economic
development.
As a country with one of the highest population
growth rates in the world, the Republic of the Marshall
Islands has followed with great interest the International
Conference on Population and Development. It was a
shame that this process was nearly derailed by semantic
disagreements. Fortunately, the Conference, in Cairo,
after arduous and intensive negotiations, saw fit to adopt
an expanded international population strategy, as a result
of which we now have a well-thought-out Plan of Action.
It is of concern to us that so much of the cost involved in
the implementation of the Plan of Action will be borne by
individual countries. We will, however, make every
effort to maximize our participation in this Plan of
Action.
22


The United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish
Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks recently
completed its third round of discussions here in New York.
We all owe a great deal to its distinguished Chairman for
his masterful stewardship. For the Marshall Islands, this
Conference is particularly important as we seek to build our
capacity to utilize our marine resources responsibly. Unlike
distant-water fishing nations, our geographical location
compels us to ensure the sustainable exploitation of our
fisheries resources for future generations, whether within or
outside our exclusive economic zone. This is a matter of
survival, one that transcends economics.
I submit, however, that large-scale commercial
fisheries are a new concept for our people. That being so,
we are interested in modern methodologies for the
commercial exploitation of fisheries resources. We must
familiarize ourselves with them. In this regard, the active
assistance of the developed countries is needed to train our
people in the modern techniques of commercial fishing. In
this context, it is essential that we gain preferential access
to international markets. We have brought this matter up
many times, and we urge the Assembly to promote trade as
well as training. While we are not asking for much, we do
hope that assistance for self-help will continue to be
forthcoming.
The development of human resources is probably the
most important factor in improving the economic situation
in the Marshall Islands. We are grateful to New Zealand
and to the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum -
Australia - for their efforts in this field. We encourage
others to follow their example. Thus, together with other
Forum countries, we will aspire to develop a strategy that
will prepare the way for the World Summit for Social
Development.
We recognize that further improvement of our
relationships with the various United Nations agencies in
our region is essential. Furthermore, because of their
increased responsibilities and workloads, we would
encourage an increase in the number of representatives of
the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the
United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations
Development Programme in the region, and we would also
support an increase in their funding.
I also wish to associate myself with my colleagues
from the region regarding the application by the South
Pacific Forum for observer status at the United Nations. I
urge the General Assembly to seriously consider this
request, as it would be of great value to our region
inasmuch as it would strengthen our ties to the United
Nations.
Of equal importance is the World Conference on
Women in Beijing next year. As a matrilineal society, we
have long recognized the wisdom of including women in
our decision-making process, and we look forward to
participating in the Beijing Conference.
During the World Hearings on Development earlier
this year, many of the expert witnesses spoke of the high
proportion of United Nations expenditures earmarked for
peace-keeping, much to the detriment of overall
development efforts. This is a matter of ongoing concern
to the Marshall Islands as well as to several other small
countries. We feel that the sheer number and cost of
these operations are getting out of hand. The preservation
of global peace is of the utmost importance, but in
relative terms the costs that fall on smaller developing
States is very large. The Marshall Islands will actively
participate in this matter in the Fifth Committee, and we
hope to work together with others for a more equitable
apportionment of expenses and assessed contributions.
We are fully supportive of the views put forward by the
President of Latvia regarding the concept of the 'capacity
to pay'.
The people of the Marshall Islands regard with
abhorrence the numerous human rights abuses that are
occurring around the world. We shall be very vigilant in
the discussions following on the Vienna Declaration on
this matter. We believe there is no statute of limitations
to human rights abuses, as clearly they are crimes against
humanity. The prevalent lack of common decency, which
the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina so painfully
described in his recent address, must be eradicated.
We note that His Excellency President Boris Yeltsin
of the Russian Federation stated that the fiftieth
anniversary of the United Nations should also
commemorate the victims of the Second World War. My
delegation fully supports this concept, particularly since
the fate of many Pacific Island people during the Second
World War remains an unwritten chapter in the history
books. For example, the atrocities carried out against the
people of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands have not been
fully addressed. We trust that moral restitution will be
made to the memory of these victims.
The consequences of recent geo-political events have
amply demonstrated the need for the expansion of the
Security Council. With 184 Members, the United Nations
must ensure that the Security Council reflects the realities
of the changed situation. My delegation supports the
proposal for increased membership. Moreover, there is an
acute need for increased transparency in the work of the
Council. In this context, it is appalling to note that the
Security Council, whose decisions affect all Members, does
not involve more States in its decision-making process. As
a positive remedial solution, the suggestion by the Minister
for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand in this regard is of
great significance and should be considered.
I should like to remind the members of the General
Assembly of the continued presence in the Marshall Islands
of dangerous residual radioactive contaminants from United
States nuclear- weapons-testing programmes. Members will
no doubt recall that it was during the relatively brief period
of the United Nations-approved trusteeship that 67 atomic
bombs were detonated on islands that had been inhabited
peacefully and productively by the people of the Marshall
Islands for centuries. This must be regarded as a matter of
more than historical interest, in view of the resulting legacy
of horrific environmental degradation and tragic human
suffering - a legacy that threatens to haunt the Marshallese
people for centuries to come.
Documents recently declassified and released confirm
that the full extent of the radioactive contamination
resulting from these tests was not disclosed to the Marshall
Islands by the United States during the negotiation of the
Compact of Free Association. Accordingly, neither the
compensation provided nor the remedial measures
undertaken or contemplated for the clean-up of some of the
contaminated islands and the treatment of the affected
human population can now be regarded as adequate.
My Government lacks the huge sums required to
ensure the proper clean-up and disposal of the radioactive
contaminants and the treatment of the radiation-induced
illnesses and birth defects caused by the nuclear-weapons
tests. Notably, the containment facility that was established
for the radioactive materials gathered from some
contaminated areas is wholly unsatisfactory by any
reasonable environmental standard.
What, then, is my Government to do? We may hope
for the unreserved cooperation of the former administering
Power in fully cleaning up and disposing of its nuclear
waste and in adequately aiding our afflicted people.
However, as a country that every day continues to suffer
the consequences of the failure by that Power to meet its
obligations, we must look to such alternatives as we may
find. In short, we must do more than simply hope.
It is with this unhappy dilemma in mind that we ask
the General Assembly to consider sympathetically our
efforts to attend to the restoration of our lands and the
treatment of our people. The clean-up and disposal of
nuclear contamination in the Marshall Islands will require
very large sums of money indeed. The effective disposal
of those contaminants will require their permanent
isolation from the human biosphere. An international
facility on a remote, uninhabited atoll of the Marshall
Islands for the safe, permanent disposal of nuclear
materials would, if technically feasible and politically
acceptable, meet these requirements. My Government
wishes it to be understood that such a facility would also
serve the global interest in securing the safe and
permanent disposal of a portion of the world’s dangerous
nuclear materials, an interest that, at present, is by no
means accommodated anywhere in the world.
Consequently, my Government has resolved to conduct a
preliminary feasibility study for such a facility and to
consult closely with interested members of the
international community as we proceed.
In this regard, I wish to commend the remarks made
by the Foreign Minister of Norway in calling on the
International Atomic Energy Agency to convene an
international conference on the management of nuclear
wastes. We look forward with interest to such a
conference, and we pledge our support.
My Government recognizes that the establishment of
a nuclear materials disposal facility in the Marshall
Islands may upon detailed analysis be found to be
unfeasible or otherwise unacceptable. In that event, my
Government will look to the Members of this
Organization for their support in the effort to secure the
complete removal from the Marshall Islands of all
residual radioactive contaminants and of the existing
storage facility. We expect that the party responsible for
the radioactive contamination of the Marshall Islands will
provide the funds and the technical means required to
effect this removal promptly and completely, as well as
to ensure the restoration of all the affected islands to their
full economic viability. We expect that this Organization,
which placed our islands under trusteeship in the first
place, will ensure that justice prevails.
At this time, my Government requests the
sympathetic support of the General Assembly as we
24


continue with the effort to secure a commitment to
adequate treatment and full compensation of all the victims
of the nuclear-weapons-testing programme. My
Government attaches the utmost importance and immediate
urgency to this matter.
The issues I have mentioned are of high priority. It is
my sincere hope that when we gather together next year,
our efforts will indeed have yielded concrete results, visible
and meaningful to our peoples. To accept anything less
would be a disappointment.
"
6782,49,1994,PNG," On behalf of
my delegation and Government and the people of Papua
New Guinea I join previous speakers in warmly
congratulating Ambassador Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire
on his election as the President of the forty-ninth session
of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that
he will maintain the high standards set by his
predecessors and lead us skilfully through our important
deliberations. I pledge my delegation’s cooperation in the
discharge of the responsibilities of his high office.
At the same time as we welcome Ambassador Essy,
my delegation would also like to pay tribute to his
predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador Samuel
Insanally of Guyana, who skilfully guided the work of the
forty-eighth session.
As consistent opponents of the vile doctrine of
apartheid and the unjust political system on which it was
based, the people and Government of Papua New Guinea
take particular pleasure in welcoming the readmission of
a new and democratic South Africa to the United Nations.
We look forward to strengthening our relations with the
Government and people of South Africa in a bilateral as
well as a multilateral setting.
27


With the end of the cold war, we are in a challenging
period. Our collective resolve should be for the good of
humanity. That calls for increased multilateral diplomacy,
especially of the nature espoused in the United Nations
Charter.
To that end, my Government values regional
cooperation and believes that such efforts would enhance
the basis for regional stability and international
development cooperation. Papua New Guinea values its
membership of the South Pacific Forum and the Melanesian
Spearhead Group, just as it enjoys its association with the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a
special observer. These regional organizations have forged
mutual cooperation between member countries as well as
enhancing the atmosphere for international cooperation.
Such cooperation was evident during the recent South
Pacific Forum session held in Brisbane, Australia, where
six countries - namely Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu - were able to
agree to work together towards a common approach on
logging and the export of timber. That positive
development in a regional context is of definite value to
ongoing global endeavours for the environment and
sustainable development.
We believe that an increasing number of issues are of
global importance and must be addressed on a global basis.
In this regard, the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, the
Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of
Small Island Developing States in Barbados, and the recent
World Conference on Population and Development in
Cairo, as well as the forthcoming World Summit for Social
Development in Copenhagen and the Fourth World
Conference on Women in Beijing next year, suggest that
these issues are extremely important and need concerted
international efforts. While there is emerging consensus on
these issues, there seems to be a lack of commitment to
providing the necessary resources to achieve those
objectives.
Is it worth the time and effort expended in adopting
visionary resolutions and declarations when the required
resources are not there to fulfil the programmes and
objectives of these world conferences? In that regard my
delegation is particularly anxious to see international
support for the Barbados Programme of Action on
Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States.
The United Nations initiative on opportunity and
participation focuses on the particular need of developing
countries in their efforts to maximize the participation of
all their citizens in activities aimed at sustainable
development and an effective management of resources.
In this regard I welcome the Secretary-General’s
interim report on this initiative, to be issued under item
92 (j) of the agenda of the forty-ninth session. My
Government looks forward to the final report by the panel
of distinguished experts, to be issued to coincide with the
fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.
It is clear that these issues and others require both a
national and a collective international approach,
particularly those relating to environmental and climatic
changes which transcend national boundaries. Agenda 21,
adopted at the Rio Earth Summit, provides a good basis
for international cooperation and action.
Consistent with the emerging international consensus
on major global issues, my Prime Minister, the Right
Honourable Sir Julius Chan, has emphasized the need for
a global view to be taken of these concerns and for our
Government to take effective action nationally as well as
regionally in pursuance of our foreign policy.
In taking a global view we must not allow vague
generalities to substitute for practical action. Each of us
must contribute to resolving global problems where we
can be most effective.
We must follow the thrust of recommendations
contained in the Secretary-General’s 'Agenda for Peace'
and an 'Agenda for Development' prepared for our
guidance, and we must pursue those goals, starting at
home and in our respective regions.
As far as Papua New Guinea’s foreign relations are
concerned, we are giving renewed attention to the need to
work the Pacific in a practical way. In doing so, we are
not turning away from mutually beneficial ties that have
developed over the years with countries and regional
organizations such as ASEAN, but are trying to
consolidate and to continue diversifying our foreign
relations in a wider context.
We remain just as emphatically committed to
maintaining - and where possible strengthening - Papua
New Guinea’s long-standing links with other countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and elsewhere.
28


Even as we focus renewed attention on certain
countries and objectives, our basic approach to the
development of Papua New Guinea’s foreign relations
remains one of active and selective engagement. Our
specific objectives, including our efforts to work the
Pacific, will be viewed, and pursued, in a global
perspective.
Despite the uncertainties that have arisen and the
terrible conflicts that have erupted in various regions, the
end of the cold war has, we believe, enabled Members of
the United Nations to reconsider security on a
comprehensive basis. My Government therefore commends
the attention that reports of the Secretary-General and the
United Nations Development Programme have given to
non-military threats, to security in the widest sense, and to
measures to reduce threats to security by other - and more
than military - means. In a very real, and particular, sense
the end of the cold war enables the United Nations to return
to its roots.
We are faced with a historic opportunity to pursue,
debate and take actions on issues of human welfare that are
central to the purposes of the United Nations.
Eighty-five per cent of the people in my country live
in rural communities where the basic needs of food and
shelter are secured on a sustainable basis. However,
despite the sustainable livelihood of our people, natural
disasters can occur, as happened when unexpectedly high
floods destroyed houses, damaged crops and disrupted
services in much of my home province, Gulf, early this
year.
In the past 12 months, various parts of Papua New
Guinea have been afflicted by natural disasters such as
floods, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activities,
which have placed a severe burden on our resources. The
sudden volcanic eruptions that caused more than 60,000
people to be evacuated from the town of Rabaul and
surrounding areas of East New Britain Province more than
one week ago have considerably taxed our resources. The
volcanic activity is still continuing.
We appreciate the promptness with which various
Governments, particularly those in our region, including
Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America,
continue to respond when natural disasters occur in small
island countries of the region, including my own country.
I take this opportunity to register my Government’s
appreciation for the positive responses we have received
from various Governments, international organizations and
non-governmental organizations. We have yet to establish
the extent of the damage to property, crops and food
gardens due to the continuing volcanic activity. In this
regard, my Government would appreciate international
assistance in its restoration and rehabilitation programmes
in due course.
Regarding the collective international commitment
we all undertook at Rio de Janeiro, my Government is in
the process of instituting a national sustainable-
development strategy. On a subregional level, we have
issued a joint declaration on cooperation in the
development of natural resources with our fellow
members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group, the
Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Among other things, it
provides a framework for exchanges of information on
foreign countries that exploit and harvest our natural
resources in unsustainable ways and engage in transfer
pricing and illegal operations.
We are party to agreements reached at the Brisbane
meeting of the South Pacific Forum to cooperate on a
wider basis in order to ensure the sustainable development
of fisheries and forestry resources. We believe
development must be equitable if it is to be sustained.
The ongoing failure to reduce environmental
pollution in advanced industrial countries undermines the
global commitments made at Rio de Janeiro.
The people and the Government of Papua New
Guinea are especially sensitive about the need for balance
between equity and development. We are continuing to
experience the sad consequences that arose from the lack
of proper balance among the immediate needs of people,
the environment and development in the area around the
Panguna copper mine, in our province of Bougainville.
Allow me to touch on an area of serious concern to
my delegation and my Government. This relates to
allegations of human rights violations on the island in
Bougainville Province of Papua New Guinea. The
allegations of human rights violations have been unduly
orchestrated through the Human Rights Commission in
Geneva. This, I wish to assure the Assembly, is an ill-
conceived attempt to discredit the Government and the
people of Papua New Guinea.
From the very beginning of its life as an independent
state, in 1975, Papua New Guinea has had embodied in
its constitution human rights provisions as entrenched
29


basic and fundamental rights and freedoms of the human
person.
These cover all internationally recognized human
rights Covenants and more. They include the liberty of the
person, freedom from forced labor, freedom from arbitrary
search and entry, freedom of conscience, thought and
religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and
association, the right to freedom of employment, the right
to privacy, freedom of information, freedom of movement,
and protection from unjust deprivation of property. An
honest and objective assessment of the situation in Papua
New Guinea should leave no one in doubt as to our good
record in the observance of and respect for human rights.
My Government therefore sees no difficulty in meeting
the request made by the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights to provide a report on alleged human rights
abuses in Bougainville. Outsiders have been allowed to
visit and to report on what they see; Bougainville is neither
closed nor shut off from all external contacts.
The Bougainville peace conference is expected to
discuss human rights issues, including allegations of abuses.
The Government intends to set up a human rights
commission to investigate, provide redress for and prevent
repetition of human rights violations. We are confident that
the report we are providing will deal with all legitimate
United Nations concerns.
The situation in Bougainville is not a colonial
problem. It is not a problem of human rights as such. It is
not a minority or indigenous people’s issue. The trouble in
Bougainville Province, stemming as it does from claims to
compensation for the use of tribal lands in the process of
development during a mining project, makes all separatist
claims that are being canvassed by some commentators ring
very hollow.
Compensation claims are very common in all the
provinces of Papua New Guinea, which is a country
experiencing a mining and petroleum resources
development boom. The ownership of the land in which the
mineral resources are located is vested in groups of clans
or tribes or other congregations of extended families, and
in a very special way their whole being is wrapped up in
the land and the environment. Therefore the determination
of the legal rights of these groups to the benefits from any
mining projects on their land becomes a very complicated
and sensitive affair indeed. This is the real basis of the
Bougainville problem, and it is a problem faced by the
Government in just about every province in the country.
A perfectly legitimate resource-benefit dispute
between the mining company and the traditional
landowners has taken advantage of by criminal elements,
whose activities derailed the negotiations for a just
solution on compensation for the use of land for the
development of the giant Panguna copper mine, which at
the time was the biggest foreign-exchange earner for the
country.
In a vibrant democracy such as the one we have in
Papua New Guinea, we cannot deny our people’s
fundamental rights. The exercise of their rights
determines the Government that will take office. In our
continuing effort to find a resolution to the unfortunate
situation in Bougainville, my Prime Minister has recently
taken an initiative to bring the conflict to a peaceful end.
We have accordingly negotiated a cease-fire with all
major parties to the crisis.
I am pleased to add that preparations for a
Bougainville peace conference, planned to begin on
10 October, are well in hand. A regional peace-keeping
force, made up of units from Tonga, Fiji and Vanuatu,
with Australian and New Zealand logistical support and
the cooperation, in particular, of the Prime Minister,
Deputy Prime Minister, Government and people of the
Solomon Islands, is being formed to facilitate the peace
process. I am pleased to say that at this very moment a
status-of-forces agreement has been signed in Suva, Fiji,
between my Prime Minister and representatives from the
participating countries to formalize the arrangements. We
believe this peace-keeping operation now being put in
place is an example of regional self-help, and an approach
worthy of endorsement and wider consideration and
application.
While we are attempting to find a peaceful solution
to the worst crisis faced by Papua New Guinea since
independence, my Government can only express its deep
concern at the continuing failure of people with much
older national institutions to do the same, and of
Governments elsewhere to act purposefully in their stead.
We are deeply disturbed by the continuing violence
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the elusive cease-fire process
and the paralysis of political will that has so far failed to
halt aggression. In the cases of Rwanda, Somalia and
other trouble areas, I must say that the horrors being
revealed to the world have caused the most profound
shock in my country. Can we, the Members of the
United Nations, really do no more to end the violence, to
reduce the suffering and to bring mass murderers to
30


justice? Can we not act faster? Can we be no more
effective? These questions are especially urgent in an age
where the complaint has sometimes been made that the
United Nations is not balancing its attention and resources
properly between peace-keeping and development.
Even as we regret the terrible situations in some parts
of the world, we can only be heartened by developments
elsewhere. Thus my Government welcomes the
constructive steps being taken by the Government of Israel
and the Palestinian Liberation Organization to build peace
in one of the most troublesome parts of the world. We
applaud the skilful, determined and unselfish diplomacy that
has facilitated the process and still continues to lend it
support.
Elsewhere in the world, developments to bring about
a political settlement in Haiti have given my Government
cautious hope that diplomacy will continue to be an
effective means of securing peace in such a complex
situation. The cease-fire in Northern Ireland suggests that
all is never completely lost in even the most enduring and
seemingly intractable conflicts.
Closer to home, my Government is optimistic about
the prospects for securing peace through the Regional
Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and other efforts to enhance confidence-building
in South-East Asia.
We urge the Government of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea to desist from the development of
nuclear weapons.
Firmly committed to maintaining and strengthening
relations with the People’s Republic of China on the basis
of existing agreements, my Government none the less sees
the developing dialogue between the People’s Republic of
China and Taiwan as very promising indeed.
Following the successful World Conference on Human
Rights held in Vienna in 1993, the draft text of the Agenda
for Development acknowledges that development is a
human right. It also states quite rightly that development
is 'the most secure basis for peace'. But development in
an increasingly interdependent world involves more than
national will and resources. It requires international
support, or at least an international environment that is not
actively hostile.
While the world must surely welcome the successful
conclusion of the Uruguay round of negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, peoples and
Governments in developing countries are entitled to look
for more, particularly by way of measures to reduce and
ultimately remove completely barriers that obstruct our
capacity to compete effectively in international trade.
Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have
been active participants in the deliberations of the Special
Committee on decolonization. We have been strong
advocates of the right to self-determination in New
Caledonia and of special safeguards for the indigenous
Kanaks. Like other members of the South Pacific Forum,
we remain firm in our support of the rights of the
Kanaks. Our vigilance in relation to the implementation
of the Matignon Accords will be maintained until the
ultimate objective is achieved.
With formal termination of the last United Nations
Trusteeship mandate, over Palau, later this year, and with
the implementation of the Compact of Free Association
with the United States of America, my Government looks
forward to welcoming Palau to full membership of the
United Nations in due course.
In taking a global view from the perspective of the
part of the Asia-Pacific region where Papua New Guinea
is located, I have tried to relate immediate national and
regional issues to wider international concerns. In doing
so, I have been aware that other delegations, hearing of
events and attitudes in my part of the world, have been
placing us in a global perspective too.
In the South Pacific, my Government sees
worthwhile prospects for enhancing mutually beneficial
cooperation in a number of areas that have not previously
received the attention they deserve, including the
promotion of trade, investment and tourism, and
development of the region’s vast natural resources.
Papua New Guinea believes that the ongoing
consultations aimed at expanding the number of
permanent seats on the Security Council and at the
revitalization of the General Assembly are timely. We
hope that the process will reflect the current international
economic and political climate. Thus, we are pleased to
note the progress being made in improving financial
controls and in exploring options for further reform within
the United Nations system. We hope that both processes
will contribute to further development of the
Organization’s capacity for effective achievement of its
objectives.
31


As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United
Nations, we should all re-commit ourselves to the purposes
and principles of the United Nations Charter. An era of
cooperation and understanding has dawned. Let us not
miss the opportunity for peace, security and prosperity for
humanity.
"
6790,49,1994,AUS,"I warmly congratulate you, Your Excellency Minister Essy, on your election as President of the General Assembly at this forty-ninth session. Australia is very pleased to serve in the Assembly under your presidency and looks forward to relying on your wisdom and your experience as you preside over our deliberations.
The last year has provided its full measure of challenges for the United Nations. The hopes for a new era of peace, after the decades of sterile confrontation between the super-Powers, seem not much closer to being realized. In Southern Africa and the Middle East, there have been remarkable advances in solving some of the world's most intractable problems, but they stand in contrast to the nightmarish conflicts of Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda. These are only the latest, and most prominent, of a long string of deadly conflicts within State borders, tearing existing States apart and far exceeding the threats to peace posed by conflict between States. These intra-State conflicts have been marked by extreme savagery, each day offering new evidence of how cruel and dangerous a place the world remains for so many of its people.
The combined impact of a number of these conflicts has had a corrosive effect on the standing of the United Nations. Pictures of Blue Helmets standing by, unable to prevent conflict and impotent to save life, have become a media cliche. The role that the United Nations system has continued to play in its economic, social and humanitarian work, in responding to the 'silent emergencies' of poverty and deprivation, has been overshadowed by the public image of an organization failing to meet its responsibilities and unequal to the challenges. Some of this imagery is deeply unfair, failing to take account of the innumerable constraints under which the United Nations operates - and in particular failing to acknowledge that, at the end of the day, the United Nations can do no more than what its Member States allow it to do, or give it the resources to do.
But the underlying reality is that the United Nations, and we Member States that make it up, have not yet developed a clear and confident sense of the United Nations own role in the new environment with which we are confronted - where the most common source of conflict is no longer disputes between States, but explosive conflict within States, more often than not expressed in the form of competing ethno-nationalist or religious claims.
Of course ethnic or religious difference is not, by itself, a recipe for conflict within States. Australia is just one example, among many, of a highly successful multi-ethnic, multicultural society in which tolerance and peace prevail. For ethnic or religious differences or competing nationalist aspirations to deteriorate into deadly conflict, something more is necessary. And almost invariably that something has been a failure of Governments to deliver basic needs and to satisfy the most basic aspirations of their citizens. In almost every case of major intra-State conflict of recent times, from the former
Soviet republics to Rwanda, ethnic and religious conflict has been associated with declining per capita gross national product, the rise of demagogic politics, and the collapse of effective, responsible government.
All this means that it is no longer possible, in the post-cold-war era, for the international community simply to ignore, as it largely did in the past, conflict occurring within State borders which does not significantly impact on other States. The compartmentalization which existed through the cold war years - in which peace and security issues, development issues, and human rights and justice issues were treated as being in completely different conceptual and institutional boxes - no longer seems adequate to deal with the real world distress that so many people are suffering. Basic economic needs, let alone the needs of individuals and groups for dignity and liberty, cannot begin to be met in environments where nobody's personal security can be guaranteed. And that means, in turn, that the international community cannot simply turn away from being involved in protecting human security in many of those situations which might previously have been regarded as wholly internal in character.
This truth has, of course, already been recognized to the extent that the United Nations has become involved in essentially intra-State conflicts in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda and Haiti. But for the most part that involvement has been hesitant, half-hearted, lacking in confidence, worried about its rationale, too little, and too late. We have now to reach out boldly and try to recapture some of the original vision built into the stated aims of the Charter. We have to reintegrate the relationship among the three basic objectives of peace, meeting the need for security; development, meeting economic needs; and human rights and justice, meeting the needs for individual and group dignity and liberty.
The distinction between peace and security on the one hand and development on the other has too often been a matter for sterile and unhelpful debate, with attempts to trade off one for the other as key goals for the United Nations. Any viable modern concept of international peace, let alone peace within States, must recognize that the two are indissolubly bound up with each other: there can be no sustainable peace without development, and no development without peace.
In this context, Australia warmly welcomes the Secretary-General's efforts in producing An Agenda for Development which, following on as it does from An Agenda for Peace, fully recognizes the relationship between peace and development, acknowledging that equitable development eradicates many of the socio-political conditions in which threats to peace breed. It places an entirely appropriate emphasis on individual human beings as the end object and beneficiaries of our developmental efforts. This concept of course, in various guises, lies behind most of the international community's key ideas about development in recent years, including 'adjustment with a human face', 'human development' and, most recently, 'human security'. I must also applaud the focus which the Secretary-General has placed on practical international cooperation for global human security, for example in the areas of emergency humanitarian assistance, effective governance and all the social issues which form the agenda of the world social summit.
A more integrated effort will clearly be required of the United Nations system if the objectives set out in An Agenda for Development are to be achieved. It is imperative that we improve the system's ability to develop and implement social and economic development programmes in a more coordinated and coherent manner, including by finding ways to allow the Bretton Woods institutions and United Nations bodies to work in closer harmony. An example of a more systematic approach that the United Nations system might be able to adopt is the recent package of reforms undertaken by the Economic and Social Council. The new approach to operational activities, and the joint programme which the Economic and Social Council agreed to earlier this year to tackle the health and development impacts of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, demonstrate the achievements that are possible through such reform.
But more will be required than this, including changes in the senior decision-making structure of the United
Nations Secretariat. Considerable reform in the intergovernmental elements of the United Nations system has been achieved and is being worked out, but the same is not true of the Secretariat itself. Notwithstanding some welcome recent changes, including in particular the designation by the Secretary-General of a special adviser on operational activities, I believe that there continues to be a strong case for creating a new working collegiate executive of four Deputy Secretary-Generals to work with the Secretary-General - responsible respectively for economic and social affairs, peace and security affairs, humanitarian affairs and administration and management.
A key source of threats to national and international security lies in unsustainable patterns of consumption and exploitation of resources. High population growth and competition for resources have been contributing factors in several of the recent crises involving the United Nations, including Rwanda and Somalia, and competition over scarce water resources is a potential cause of conflict in a number of regions. Such threats demonstrate how important it is, in security terms, for the United Nations to strengthen its ability to deal with development issues. The international community has developed a significant body of international laws, norms, agreements and arrangements for the rational and cooperative management of scarce resources. The United Nations system needs to ensure that it takes timely, effective and coordinated action to help implement this framework and the programmes for action agreed on at recent global conferences. The outcome of last month's Cairo Conference has provided a blueprint to address problems of population and development, acknowledging the central role of women in the development process.
For its part, the Commission on Sustainable Development must develop a genuine capacity to monitor the implementation of Agenda 21, using its political influence to bring about an observable difference in approaches to environment and development. We also attach particular importance to early implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States in Barbados in May this year. No less important has been the entry into force of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The adoption in June 1994 of the new Agreement implementing Part XI of the Convention secures a widely accepted legal order for the world's oceans, and provides, in effect, a common language for interaction between States on matters affecting two thirds of the world's surface.
From the outset of the establishment of the United Nations, the international community has acknowledged human rights as a central and legitimate subject of international attention. For many years, however, and notwithstanding the system of international human rights treaties, this attention carried with it the ideological baggage of the cold war and was too often marked by confrontation and recrimination. In recent years the international community has begun to develop more cooperative and potentially more effective ways of promoting better observance of human rights standards.
These include the creation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the promotion of national and regional human rights bodies and improved technical assistance. They also include a welcome reaffirmation in Vienna last year of the indivisibility of all human rights - economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights - in developing a base for positive change. And they include the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal to try violations of humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. A further important specific step that Australia believes should be taken in this direction is the creation of a permanent international criminal court, to deal with gross violations of international criminal law wherever they might occur.
Human rights observance has its own profound significance for peace and security. The drafters of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized this connection. The international community has clear obligations under the Charter to protect basic human rights, and the most basic freedom of all - the right to life - is directly dependent on the maintenance of peace. We must be prepared to accept a wider application of the notion of security as it appears in the Charter, recognizing that security in the post-cold-war era has as much to do with the protection of individuals - guaranteeing human security - as it has to do with State security - the defence of national borders.
Human security, in this view, is as much if not more threatened by intra-State conflict as it is by conflict between States, and intra-State conflict is as much a concern of the United Nations as is international conflict. The experience of the last few years underlines the lesson that a State whose Government systematically disregards human rights, ignores the rule of law and fails to strive for equitable development and distributive justice is a State showing clear signs of heading towards breakdown and civil strife. To try to anticipate with appropriate preventive strategies that breakdown and conflict is, for the United Nations system, not to go beyond its Charter mandate, but to fully realize it.
The international community has traditionally talked about security in almost wholly military terms. In a United Nations context, collective security has meant Member States renouncing the use of force against each other and agreeing to come to the aid of a Member when it is attacked. Even the more recent, and very welcome, focus on the concept of common security has been premised on the idea that States will be more secure militarily with defence strategies that are aimed at building security with others rather than against others.
If the international community is to respond fully and effectively to the new challenges of the post-cold-war era, this perspective has to be broadened. One way to do that is to talk, as many are now doing, in terms of comprehensive security, which conveys the important idea that security is multidimensional in character, demanding attention not only to political and diplomatic disputes but to economic underdevelopment, trade disputes, human- rights abuses and the like.
But Australia's preference - as I spelled out last year in addressing this Assembly, when I launched the so- called Blue Book, Cooperating for Peace - is to describe our shared objective as cooperative security. The term cooperative security is designed to embrace and capture the essence of all those three other ideas: collective, common and comprehensive security. It is designed to shift the focus away from traditional, defensive, State-centred thinking, and at the same time to convey the flavour of consultation rather than confrontation, reassurance rather than deterrence, transparency rather than secrecy, prevention rather than correction, and interdependence rather than unilateralism.
Cooperative security in practice means a whole range of different strategies designed both to prevent and to resolve conflict, certainly including the traditional United Nations roles of peace-keeping and peace enforcement. But the strategies that I want particularly to emphasize today are those at the preventive end of the response spectrum, in particular peace-building and preventive diplomacy.
As the idea of peace building has been developed by the Secretary General in An Agenda for Peace and in An Agenda for Development, it has largely been restricted to the situations of post-conflict economic and institutional restoration within countries. Australia's view is that while that is a very important element of the idea it is unduly restrictive, and that the concept of peace-building should assume a much more prominent place in our thinking about the international community's role and responsibilities.
We see peace-building as describing the whole range of strategies designed to address basic and underlying causes of disputes and conflicts: strategies aimed at ensuring that they do not arise in the first place, or that if they do arise, they do not subsequently recur. Those strategies are applicable at both intra-State and international levels. At the international level we are talking essentially about various regimes and arrangements designed to minimize threats to security, to promote confidence and trust and to create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation, especially through arms control and disarmament treaties; legal regimes such as those on maritime passage and the status of refugees; dispute- resolution mechanisms such as the International Court of Justice; and multilateral dialogue forums, such as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) or the new regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the in-country level, peace- building essentially involves strategies to encourage economic development, ensure the observance of human rights, broadly defined, and to facilitate good governance.
So perceived, peace-building lies right at the interface between the United Nations agendas for peace and for development. Peace-building activity is already occurring in a great many ways and in a great many places. The attention being given to environment, resource and population issues, the higher profile being accorded to human-rights protection and the significant progress being made on many disarmament issues are all manifestations of this at the general international level. And more attention is being given to democratization and institution-building strategies, as well as economic ones, for particular countries where effective governance has broken down, or seems about to.
What is really necessary is that more of this activity be integrated and coordinated within the United Nations system, that activities now being pursued in isolation and without any overriding sense of common purpose be better linked together. If we are to get peace, development and human rights objectives better synchronized, then some institutional changes are necessary. A good start may be to vest responsibility for developing and coordinating peace- building strategies in the position of deputy secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, a position which I suggested earlier should be created.
Whatever the achievability of peace-building international regimes in other areas, the end of the cold war has certainly opened up for the international community exciting new possibilities to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and destabilizing conventional-arms races. There is now, for example, an historic opportunity to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The decision by most of the nuclear-weapon States to maintain moratoriums on testing has made a major contribution to an improved negotiating atmosphere in the Conference on Disarmament. Australia very much hopes that the People's Republic of China will play its part in bringing those negotiations to a conclusion by likewise abstaining from further tests. Agreement on a comprehensive test ban will also have a significant impact on the achievement of nuclear disarmament, and especially nuclear non-proliferation, objectives. Australia urges all members of the Conference on Disarmament to seize this opportunity, which may not present itself again, to conclude the test-ban treaty as soon as possible.
A further vital contribution to nuclear disarmament would be made by the negotiation of a cut-off convention. Australia hopes that all members of the Conference on Disarmament will support the efforts of the Canadian coordinator and agree to a negotiating mandate by the beginning of the 1995 session.
Underlying all the efforts by the international community over the past 25 years to stem the spread of nuclear weapons has been the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT remains the cornerstone of international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. Its success is reflected in this phenomenon: the general expectation in the 1960s was that the world would have as many as 25 nuclear-weapon States by the 1980s, but instead, 160 countries have now acceded to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States, leaving only a handful outside the Treaty framework. The peaceful-use assurances derived from the Treaty and from the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency have laid the foundation for very valuable international cooperation in fields such as nuclear power generation, nuclear medicine and agricultural and scientific applications of nuclear energy. In addition, the NPT incorporates the only commitment from the five nuclear-weapon States to complete nuclear disarmament. The cause of complete nuclear disarmament, which
Australia fully supports, is moving in the right direction, but it is clear that more needs to be done by the nuclear- weapon States if the pace is to be maintained.
A decision to be made on extending the Treaty at the NPT Review Conference next year will allow us to secure its benefits in perpetuity. This is an opportunity we must grasp to shape a world in which our collective commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, and to a world free of nuclear weapons, can be realized. Indefinite extension of the Treaty will create an environment in which the pressures for continued nuclear disarmament will be maximized, in which nuclear proliferation will best be prevented, in which trade and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy can best be maintained, and in which the goal of universal membership of the Treaty can best be reached.
The pace of chemical- and biological-weapons disarmament continues to be encouraging. Progress is being made in preparing for implementation of the chemical-weapons Convention, and the recent Special Conference's decision to develop verification measures to strengthen the biological-weapons Convention is also very welcome. All members of the global community will benefit, in both security and trade and development terms, from the bans on these entire categories of weapons of mass destruction which will be put in place by the effective operation of both these Treaties.
In our efforts to prevent the further spread of weapons of mass destruction, we should not lose sight of the need to control conventional weaponry. Conventional weapons continue to be responsible for the overwhelming majority of the fatalities and casualties in contemporary armed conflict. In this area, the United Nations has taken an important first step in creating the Register of Conventional Arms, although I must note Australia's disappointment at the failure of its Expert Group to agree to expand the Register beyond transfers to cover productions and holdings. It is, however, most important that all States support this initial international exercise in the transparency of conventional weaponry by providing as much information as possible in their returns.
There is also a compelling need to strengthen the inhumane weapons Convention and, in particular, to extend further control over the use of, and trade in, land-mines, given the appalling and indiscriminate injuries caused to civilian populations often long after conflicts cease.
One of the most crucial elements in any functioning system of cooperative security is an effective capacity for preventive diplomacy. Australia is convinced that the United Nations can and should do more in this respect to prevent disputes escalating into armed conflict, and to this effect we propose to introduce a draft resolution on enhancing preventive diplomacy at the current session of the General Assembly.
We believe that there is widespread support for the United Nations to build stronger preventive diplomacy machinery and to develop the capacity foreseen by its founders and articulated in Article 33 to operate as an active agent in the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Organization would be able to operate more effectively in this area if it gave its staff additional skills in dispute resolution and conflict management. We commend its efforts to do so through the fellowship course of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and we will continue to provide our backing for that training. We propose that the United Nations develop a dispute resolution service within its Secretariat. We advocate strengthening the Department of Political Affairs and increasing coordination, information-sharing and early- warning capacity among and between the various elements of the United Nations system. Greater use should also be made of the resources of Member States and stronger linkages forged with regional security arrangements.
Such regional organizations and arrangements themselves can play a most useful role. We should not have unrealistic expectations of them because most cannot match the capacity of global bodies to marshal resources for peace-building or, at the other end of the scale, for military responses to crises. They nevertheless offer a way of bringing together the parties to disputes in a constructive and non-confrontational framework. We welcome recent developments to strengthen regional approaches, in particular the recent inaugural meeting of the Regional Forum of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, with its evident willingness to develop preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region. We hope that others will share our interest in exploring the scope for establishing regional peace and security resource centres - to advance these objectives under the banner of regional organizations or the United Nations itself, or both.
We welcome the steps taken by the United Nations Secretary-General to strengthen the United Nations links with regional organizations. In relation to one such important organization in Australia's own part of the world, we welcome the strong support given by Member
States for the application made by the South Pacific Forum for Observer status in the General Assembly, itself a response to the Secretary-General's invitation to consider ways of further improving the coordination of the efforts of regional bodies with those of the United Nations. Australia also welcomes the regional peace-keeping exercise under way to assist Papua New Guinea achieve a peaceful resolution of the situation in Bougainville, and the Secretary-General's expression of support for that exercise.
There is no use talking about reintegrating the United Nations or reshaping its responsibilities unless the resources are there to carry out these responsibilities. The central responsibility of Member States in this respect is to set to rights the Organization's current financial problems. Australia urges, in the strongest terms we can, all Member States to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time as a matter of obligation under the Charter.
We believe that the United Nations should look carefully at strengthening measures to encourage the prompt payment of contributions. We could, for example, explore the possibility of charging interest on overdue payments or applying Article 19 of the Charter to provide for only a 24- month grace period before voting rights are lost. We believe also that present budgetary systems could well be improved, in particular those involved with the financing of peace-keeping operations. We hope that, at a minimum, this General Assembly will be able to agree on some practical steps to move towards a sounder basis for such funding. Modern management practices, including a personnel policy more clearly based on merit, need to be adopted.
Measures such as these, while valuable, are unlikely to be sufficient in themselves to meet the financial demands which will be placed on the United Nations by its new agenda. The time has come to look at more innovative approaches to raising funds. One possibility which should be examined more seriously than hitherto, notwithstanding the complexities and sensitivities involved, is the application of levies on certain kinds of international transactions, such as air travel or foreign exchange, the capacity to carry on which depends on the existence of stability between States, to which the United Nations in turn makes a major contribution. An international levy on such transactions would be an equitable way of putting a price on an important public good. And the amounts involved are very large. The total value of global foreign exchange turnover, for example, is expected to amount to over $300 trillion next year. A levy on these transactions of only 0.01 per cent, if it could be collected, would yield over $30 billion. A flat-rate $10 added to the price of air tickets for each international sector travelled would yield $3 billion, nearly enough to cover all United Nations peace-keeping activities last year.
Whatever the funding strategy adopted, the financial burden on the United Nations system and the international community could be greatly reduced by putting a greater emphasis on preventive approaches to problem solving. It is very clear that prevention is far more cost-effective in the longer term than our current pattern of responding to problems, if at all, only after crisis points have been reached.
If the United Nations decision-making bodies are to have legitimacy and guaranteed international support in responding to the range of new and difficult situations with which the international community is now being confronted - particularly deadly conflicts and massive human rights violations occurring within States - they must be representative of the broad range of interests and perspectives of United Nations Member States. This is a key reason why enlargement of the Security Council's membership is a pressing concern for this General Assembly. It should be said, at the same time, that the Security Council's legitimacy will ultimately depend, not just on its representativeness, but upon the quality of its performance, and in that context it will be very important that the Assembly apply very rigorously the criteria and qualifications for Security Council membership elaborated in Article 23 of the Charter.
The model that would most simply meet the legitimate aspirations of the largest States excluded at present from permanent membership of the Security Council - including Japan and Germany, whose claims we support - would involve the creation of five new permanent membership seats. Assuming the continuation of the existing regional groups, three new permanent members would come from Africa and Asia, one from the Western European and Other States Group, and one from Latin America and the Caribbean. Australia would prefer not to extend the veto to any new permanent member. At the same time, we believe it would be appropriate slightly to dilute the veto power of the existing five permanent members by requiring two from their number to concur in its exercise.
If - as seems not impossible - agreement on a simple model of this kind proves not easily reachable, it may be worth giving consideration to a more complex alternative model. We have in mind one which would no doubt in practice guarantee effective permanency for the largest States currently excluded from the Council, including Japan and Germany. But it would at the same time give a greater degree of flexibility to the Council's structure and greater opportunities for the recognition of several other countries which have made a major contribution to the Organization. It might, for those reasons, be a model capable of commanding more widespread support.
This alternative model would involve, in addition to the five existing permanent members - whose veto power would again be slightly diluted, as already outlined - the creation of eight quasi-permanent seats allocated among regional groups for which consecutive re-election would be possible, together with 10 rotating non-permanent seats as at present. It would make abundant sense, in our view, for the existing regional groups to be at the same time modified to reflect post-cold-war realities. A suggested way in which these 23 seats might be distributed among such a new set of regional groups is set out in the table attached to the circulated text of this statement; that table also sets out the way in which the seats might be distributed among the existing groups. On this model, the question which States became quasi-permanent members and how long they remained on the Council in that capacity would be a matter for determination by the regional group in question.
Consequential amendments would be required to Article 23 and Article 108 of the Charter, and the opportunity should, of course, be taken at the same time to remove the anachronistic enemy States clauses. An accompanying General Assembly resolution could elaborate any new regional-group arrangements.
It is, of course, the case that any change to Security Council membership is fraught with complexity and difficulty. But if we are ever to move from the stage of generalized discussion to concrete negotiations, it is necessary to put some quite specific and comprehensive proposals on the table. I certainly do not suggest that the models I have just advanced are the only possible approaches, but I do strongly suggest that the time is now ripe for us to commence such negotiation. I believe that others share our determination to move in a spirit of good will and conscientiousness to see to it that the United Nations of the next 50 years is soundly built; and an expanded, newly legitimized Security Council is a crucial foundation in this respect.
Australia wants the United Nations, over the next 50 years, to be an active and effective agent for the peaceful settlement of disputes. We want it to be a catalyst for international peace-building, working to strengthen international law, control and reverse arms races, promote confidence and dialogue between States and address underlying causes of instability, including internal conflict. We want the United Nations to promote, in more effective coordination with the major international economic and financial institutions, equitable and sustainable development and to coordinate responses to humanitarian crises. We want it to emerge even more strongly as a promoter of universal standards of human rights and their respect by Governments. We want the United Nations to pursue its objectives of peace, development and human rights in an integrated, coordinated way, with these objectives complementing, rather than being in competition with, each other. And we want it to be an Organization assured of the wholehearted backing of its Member States and provided by them with all the financial resources it requires to meet its obligations.
In short, we want the United Nations to become the Organization which was envisaged in its Charter. One of the priority objectives of our candidacy for election to the Security Council for 1997-1998 is to help in the building of such a United Nations. We believe we have valuable contributions to bring to this task, and we look forward to working closely with all our fellow Members in the shaping of a United Nations fully capable of meeting the needs and expectations of all of us in the international community over the next 50 years.
"
6800,49,1994,NZL,"I should like, first,
to congratulate Mr. Amara Essy of Côte d’Ivoire on his
well-deserved election as President of the General
24


Assembly at its forty-ninth session and to convey to him
our good wishes for every success in his work.
The general debate is our chance, as Members of the
United Nations, to undertake together an annual review of
the Organization’s work - its successes and its failures -
and to identify collectively the issues we want to focus on.
With the fiftieth anniversary next year, there is a pressing
need to do so. That will be the occasion to chart our new
priorities for the twenty-first century.
Our responses to some of today’s challenges and
tragedies have ranged from excellent but often
under-reported to woefully inadequate and, consequently,
defiantly reported.
The peoples of the world want to believe in the United
Nations and what it should achieve. If, however, within
some parts of the Organization we are bereft of purpose
and intentions this golden anniversary threatens to be less
joyous and more muted than many of us anticipated.
New Zealand has a strong vested interest in the United
Nations success, as do most small States. The New
Zealand people have always believed in the United Nations,
in a collective approach to the resolution of global and
regional problems. This has been demonstrated by strong
support for the United Nations by successive Governments.
From our experience of - and I do not hesitate to say
this - a turbulent two years on the Security Council and as
a committed founder Member of the Organization, I would
like to take this opportunity to offer some observations
about the problems we see as players in the collective
decision-making process.
When New Zealand took part in the founding of the
United Nations we and many others saw our primary
purpose as providing for a system of collective security.
Until very recently that was little more than a vision. With
the end of the confrontation between two super-Power
blocs, the goal of 'the organized common peace', of which
President Woodrow Wilson spoke so eloquently three
generations ago, presents itself. We must not let it slip
from our grasp this time. It will, however, take real effort
and real determination.
Collective security, or working together, is the
cornerstone of the security of small States. Today they are
the overwhelming majority of the membership of this
Organization. New Zealanders recognize that peace is
indivisible, that remoteness is certainly no safeguard: a
problem in any part of the world can ripple to the Earth’s
farthest corners. While we are the country probably most
distant from the Balkans conflict, we have sent an
enhanced company of soldiers to help in efforts to ease
suffering and, I earnestly hope with the will of the parties
involved, one day bring peace throughout the former
Yugoslavia.
For the same reasons, our defence personnel can be
found engaged in peace-support operations in Africa, the
Middle East, Asia and most recently Haiti. And there are
New Zealand nurses, firefighters and aid workers spread
around the globe in support.
Against this backdrop, however, New Zealanders are
puzzled at times by the way in which the United Nations
carries out some of its important tasks. In Bosnia, despite
the employment of what is by any standards a large, well-
armed and well-trained force, people see on their
television screens nightly the frustration of the United
Nations Protection Force by small groups of irregulars, a
single policeman or even small groups of non-combatants.
In Haiti they witnessed a boat full of Blue Berets turned
away by a small group of pistol-toting thugs
unconvincingly called 'attachés'.
And what can one say about the appalling tragedy in
Rwanda? How can so much hatred have been unleashed
so viciously, killing hundreds of thousands? What we
watched with horror on our television screens was
destruction on a scale we thought only megaton bombs
were capable of. The systematic slaughter of men,
women and children simply because of their ethnic origin
leaves us all outraged.
There are no easy answers. But the first key to
unlocking the possibilities for a genuine collective
security must be the proper application of the United
Nations Charter. We have to decide at exactly what point
the United Nations should get involved in the
peacemaking operation. Do we recognize a problem, and,
if we do, is the preventive diplomacy that we so firmly
believe in occurring?
In my view, we have to follow the intention of the
Charter. First, at the outset of a crisis, or even the signs
of a crisis, we have to make more serious efforts through
that preventive diplomacy to resolve problems and
conflicts by negotiation. Efforts must be made at an early
25


stage to address the root causes of conflicts by the Security
Council’s exercising all its responsibilities under Chapter VI
of the Charter.
However, on some occasions, in these days of modern
media technology, we face the dilemma caused by the
divergence between what the public perceives as happening
and what is the reality. Extensive media coverage puts
pressure on for immediate response. In the case of
Rwanda, that was appropriate. In other circumstances, the
media oversimplify and ignore the fact that conditions on
the ground are chaotic and United Nations resources are
over-stretched.
A second area where the Charter could be more
carefully applied is when disputes are first placed before
the Council. I believe it should give affected States an
adequate hearing before addressing the problem behind
closed doors. Our experience on the Security Council
suggests the investment in openness that would be achieved
by developing a practice of collectively hearing directly
from the parties involved would be worthwhile, even if it
were done only informally.
In the same vein, the Charter specifically contemplates
the involvement, without vote, of troop-contributing
countries in significant decisions. New Zealand has pressed
this issue for some time, but so far with limited success.
The time is coming, in fact, when the General Assembly
will have to address the question if the Security Council
does not respond adequately to the concerns that have been
raised.
Under the Charter, much is expected of the Council’s
permanent members. There is no doubt that they can and
do contribute greatly to the work of the United Nations.
Leadership and sacrifices by the large Powers were, for
example, instrumental in successfully challenging
aggression against the small State of Kuwait three-and-a-
half years ago.
I emphasize again, however, the importance of the
collective nature of decision-making in the Security
Council. Making distinctions between the views of the
'P5' and the rest is not really healthy. The Council is a
team of 15. It must work together, and by that I mean
giving full weight to the views of all its members. The
strength of the Security Council is enhanced each year by
the vigorous enthusiasm brought by new members on 1
January, testing what may have become an accepted
second-best.
I would remind the Assembly that the Charter
clearly envisages that the norm for operations to maintain
international peace and security will be United Nations
operations. National operations are not ruled out, of
course. I wish therefore to highlight and question recent
trends toward coalitions under national command, and the
implications for the collective security needs of small and
distant countries where no strategic interest is involved.
However, the Security Council will be judged on its
effectiveness. Successes, hopefully, will outweigh
failures, but we all have an obligation to improve the
success rate. I am an enthusiastic supporter of improving
our success rate, but much of that will come down to the
way in which issues are managed. And it is that question
of the management of issues that I wish to address.
In our experience, the key is to use management
tools based on proven modern public- and private-sector
experience. This is very valuable. What are these tools?
And how do we apply them to the conduct of peace-
keeping operations?
I would suggest that there are six critical elements:
first, a sustainable financial system; secondly, a
transparent political accountability; thirdly, clear
objectives that incorporate regular reviews; fourthly, a
clear, unambiguous command and control structure;
fifthly, a credible legal regime that guarantees the security
of United Nations personnel; and, sixthly, the availability
of resources so that objectives can be met quickly and
efficiently.
Let me go back to that first point, a sustainable
financial system. There is no doubt that the Organization
is facing a financial crisis that cannot be ignored. We
have had serious problems with reserves and we have
significant debt to contributing countries. The largest
contributor has indicated that it will unilaterally reduce its
share of funding from October next year. The situation
is not sustainable. It requires urgent action.
Why do we have this crisis? There are some simple
answers. Some members cannot pay; others will not pay;
and some are arguing the legitimacy of their assessment.
The General Assembly, this body, must confront this
issue. The United Nations must stop extending credit to
non-payers. There is enough evidence emerging to
suggest that there may be serious inequities in the present
system.
26


Some countries with extraordinarily strong growth
over the past 5 to 10 years appear in the revised scale
issued by the Committee on Contributions with a constant
or even reduced contribution level. That is not acceptable.
It must be remedied.
We do not want a hollow celebration on the fiftieth
anniversary with a cash crisis hanging over the
Organization. We must make a commitment to resolve this
crisis before the conclusion of the forty-ninth session.
The next point is the need for political accountability.
There is in my view a parallel priority to develop and
improve the Organization’s capacity for undertaking its
collective security responsibilities. To do that we need to
put in place more transparent procedures throughout the
Organization. The management of peace-keeping
operations is allocated to the Secretariat. This is necessary
and appropriate in the same way any Government delegates
responsibility for a complex operation to its public service.
However, and I speak as a politician and as a Minister
responsible for the management and oversight of
Government departments, the days are long gone when a
public service mandarin could run a department or major
operation without detailed political oversight. This is not
a promotion of micro-management, nor am I implying any
criticism of the Secretariat staff. But as any politician
holding executive office in today’s democracies knows, the
classic recipe for a failed project is for those who are
politically accountable to lose track of implementation or to
lose the game plan.
We saw that all too clearly in the past year in
Somalia. Ironically, the Security Council had, in resolution
814 (1993), already foreseen the need in the case of the
United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) for a
detailed political accountability and provided for a
committee to follow the operation closely. But the
committee was never established.
New Zealand has proposed in the Security Council
that a committee or an ad hoc working group should be
established to fill this gap and enhance the accountability of
the Organization to its politically responsible
representatives. I certainly remain hopeful that progress
can be made in this area.
The third point I draw to the attention of members is
the need for clear objectives with regular reviews. Clearer
mission objectives must be developed and kept under
review. I am delighted that some progress has in fact been
made. The Council is now identifying more closely the
terms of mandates for United Nations operations, and it
is becoming usual to build a specific review cycle into its
mandates. But there are still two areas of weakness.
First, there is a great deal of mythology about and
very little sound analysis of the circumstances in which
force should be used by United Nations operations. Many
believe this is governed by the use or non-use of the
words 'Chapter VII'. This could well be a false
conclusion. The rules of engagement rather than abstract
reference to the Charter are much more likely to
determine actual behaviour in the field.
I am not alone in believing that there is a need to
develop greater commonality in military doctrine for
United Nations peace-keeping operations. This is
especially relevant when so many peace-keeping
contributors are regularly placed side by side in the field.
It is, however, particularly urgent in the face of new-style
operations of the intra-country type where the use of force
by factions, not necessarily Governments, is the challenge
for this body to overcome.
It is clear that common principles are necessary to
guide peace-keepers on the appropriate use of force when
they take part in operations in pursuit of an agreed United
Nations strategic objective. As for the review, while
there are plenty of mid-term reviews there is, as yet, no
systematic process of review at the end of an operation.
The budget of every peace-keeping operation should
include provision, as a principal line item, for the
preparation of a comprehensive review of the operation’s
achievements relative to the mandate set.
Such reviews should be separate from the financial
performance review and should address the substance of
the operation and seek to identify all relevant lessons for
the conduct of future operations.
I address now the question of command and control.
There is a weakness in the command and control
structures and they do need attention. It is true the
personnel of national defence forces which contribute
forces to the United Nations legally remain in their
country’s national service. But as I see it, parallel to the
allocation of responsibility to the United Nations Force
Commander must be a recognition that the national
command structure will not seek to direct their forces in
operational matters. If the national command authority
has serious difficulties, then the appropriate course of
action in all cases - except an emergency - is for the issue
27


to be resolved with United Nations Headquarters. If
resolution is not possible the unit should be withdrawn.
I come to the question of the safety of peace-keeping
personnel. A major requirement for effective collective
security is that countries contributing troops and civilian
personnel should have confidence that their personnel in the
field will have the best possible support to ensure their
safety and security. That is an issue which, as many
members know, New Zealand has pursued relentlessly
during its time on the Council. It bears on the level of
equipment with which the forces are outfitted and there is
plenty of room for improvement.
In addition, the legal regime under which peace-
keeping operations are conducted needs to reflect the
extraordinary personal risk which United Nations personnel
are undertaking on behalf of us all in carrying out collective
security operations. It is right that such personnel should
be differentiated from soldiers in an armed conflict and that
there should be a higher standard of legal responsibility for
anybody who attacks them. I urge all members of the
Assembly to support New Zealand’s initiative on this issue
currently in the Sixth Committee, that the necessary
flexibility be shown on outstanding issues and that we make
a really determined effort to complete work on the draft
convention this year.
The question of resources is always before us. In my
sixth point I would say that a critical tool for effective
collective security is a strategy for resource availability.
The situation we all saw recently in Rwanda is a classic
case. Human resources were available but they lacked
training and they lacked equipment. But there is also the
need for a capacity in all peace-keeping operations for a
forceful response in self-defence. There are important
lessons to be learned from the troop losses in Rwanda last
April and again I draw attention to the linkage between
mandates, rules of engagement, doctrine and planning.
The United Nations will have to go beyond the current
work being done on stand-by forces to address this
problem.
We believe that there is a case for redirecting a
substantial portion of bilateral military assistance into forms
of training that would better assist defence forces with the
requirements of peace-keeping operations.
There is also a role for the United Nations maintaining
the physical equivalent of the peace-keeping reserve fund
that it is supposed to have on the financial side now. A
quick start-up capability, with owned or leased equipment
immediately available to the United Nations, would have
made a significant difference in the Rwanda situation.
This is a practical and feasible step that can be taken to
ensure that future collective security can in fact rise to the
challenge.
I have spoken about the factors that need to be taken
into account in managing peace-keeping operations. I
now wish to address the terms of their engagements.
The United Nations should not be expected to take
responsibility for a situation of up to 30 years because the
parties to a conflict are unable or unwilling to summon up
the necessary political will to reach a settlement. There
comes a point when the parties must take their fate in
their own hands rather than the Council avoiding the hard
decisions just by rolling over the mandates.
At the same time, a range of different considerations
should prevail when the United Nations reaches the end
of a successful peace-keeping process. The United
Nations cannot simply walk away when a perceived end
point - such as an election - has been achieved, because
there may still be outstanding issues that need the
ongoing support of the operation, such as humanitarian
operations or local capability-building programmes to help
provide the required sound administration.
The United Nations deserves congratulations on its
achievements in Cambodia, for example, but the future
there is still not certain, and the United Nations must
maintain its responsibilities. Rehabilitation in that country
must continue.
Another example of a situation in which
peacemaking and peace-building have to be seen as a
coherent whole is in the area of demining. This is a
critically important humanitarian function. New
Zealand’s military forces have had a lot of experience in
helping the United Nations with demining in Afghanistan,
Cambodia and, most recently, Mozambique.
The Security Council Mission that visited
Mozambique about two months ago reported its dismay
at the delays and at the state of the programme generally.
At the request of the United Nations, New Zealand
stepped in early in August and began the rescue effort for
the programme. The wheel should not have had to be
reinvented. It is a concern that lessons learned from
earlier operations such as Afghanistan and Cambodia do
not appear to be retained. Having seen firsthand the
28


effects of mines in Cambodia, I do believe we should move
more expeditiously than the speed of the present
performance.
New Zealand certainly looks forward to working with
other delegations to improve performance in this area, and
I would certainly add that my Government was most
interested in the comments President Clinton made here
yesterday about the proposal for the elimination of the
world’s 85 million anti-personnel land-mines. This is an
urgent task. No one who has seen firsthand the human cost
of mines can offer anything less than full cooperation to
this end.
Finally, when we look ahead to what would really
enhance proper use of the collective security powers, we
have to conclude that reform of the Security Council is a
major task waiting to be fulfilled. Many of the things I
have discussed today require reforms by the Security
Council, or at least in conjunction with it. But I cannot
escape the conclusion that even if all of these were
accomplished, the political legitimacy of the Security
Council could still erode over a period of time. Ultimately
it could lose the credibility vital to the role it carries out.
Collective security requires the Council to be
genuinely representative of the entire United Nations
membership. We have, of course, as many others have
done, followed the debate on Security Council reform in the
Open-ended Working Group set up last year. We hear the
case made for additional permanent members. We also
hear overwhelming support for expanding the number of
non-permanent members of the Council. There are shades
of difference on the numbers for the total membership, but
consensus does seem to be emerging around five or six new
members. We consider that a limited expansion of the
number of members, paying regard to an equitable
geographical participation, is still a priority for the health
of the Organization. It is time to do what is achievable and
what benefits most Members. Given the need for 122
ratifications, we are aware that even a simple expansion,
hopefully adopted next year, will take several years to come
into force. It would not be unrealistic, therefore, for the
year 2000 to see the first meeting of the expanded Council.
There is no worth in being critical of some aspects of
the United Nations without believing, as I do, that the
problems can be cured. We, all 184 of us, are its doctors,
and we need to act quickly. We need to apportion our
costs fairly and systematically. We need to share peace-
keeping tasks, peace-keeping funding and peace-keeping
supplies. We need to accept the democratic decisions of
this Organization. We also need to adjust to the more
complex and interrelated United Nations agendas of the
future.
I therefore leave with the Assembly New Zealand’s
assurance of a renewed commitment to this unique and
essential body and of our willingness to work in that
spirit to ensure the continued relevance of the United
Nations for the next half-century.
"
6841,27,1972,NZL,"Mr. President, New Zealand joins with the previous speakers in offering you its warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency. You have already brought efficiency and vigor to the conduct of our work. Like other speakers, I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to my personal friend, Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who presided so admirably over last year's arduous session.
174.	We meet this year oppressed by the tragic events of recent weeks. A new and horrible form of savagery has been visited upon a desperately vulnerable and unprepared world. Yet this year more than most has been marked by the promise of a new era of international peace and stability. For most of its life the United Nations has mirrored the mutual suspicions and hostilities that characterized the attitude of the super-Powers over that period. Now the easing of tension in the relationships among the great Powers is reflected in a growing pattern of reconciliation among the smaller Powers. The courageous initiative of President Nixon, the summit talks in Peking, Moscow, Warsaw and elsewhere and other vigorous moves towards detente, particularly by the two super-Powers, are in the best spirit of the Charter. As both a courtesy and a duty we should pay a tribute to all the Powers concerned for the prospect of a new peace which seems to lie ahead of us.
175.	Another development in international relationships that is welcome to New Zealand, as a country having a special interest in the European Economic Community, is the impending enlargement of that Community through the entry of the United Kingdom and other new members. We look forward to the emergence of a stronger, more outward-looking and united Western Europe. The trend towards reconciliation between the countries of Western and Eastern Europe is gathering momentum. The negotiation of non-aggression treaties between West Germany and Poland and between West Germany and the Soviet Union and the four-Power agreement on Berlin were welcome first steps in that direction. We strongly hope that the current negotiations between the two Germanys will end in an agreement that will permit us very soon to welcome both to membership in the United Nations,
176.	The changes in great-Power relationships have modified the policies of countries in the area of the world of most direct interest to New Zealand. I refer to Asia and the Pacific. We have been especially encouraged by the Simla meeting between the President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister of India aimed at settling peacefully the differences between their two countries. The major problems, of course, are not yet solved; but the way has been opened for a durable settlement in the subcontinent under which the three countries of the region will be able to live together in peace. I would emphasize that New Zealand earnestly feels the need for such a settlement.
177.	Last year's crisis in East Pakistan caused human suffering on a vast and frightening scale. New Zealand, small though it is, has not hesitated to draw attention to the material and political needs which had to be met in order to end that tragic situation. The new State of Bangladesh has emerged from the chaos and suffering. However, independence alone and of itself cannot put an end to human misery. The reconstruction and development of Bangladesh represents an enormous task which the new Government cannot be expected to accomplish without massive external assistance. A great deal has already been done, both by the United Nations and by individual countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Indian Government, specifically, have successfully tackled a refugee operation larger than any ever before undertaken in the history of the world. The United Nations and non-governmental bodies have undertaken rehabilitation operations on an unprecedented scale and have thus averted more widespread suffering in the new nation. We in New Zealand have tried to help wherever we can to reduce the suffering in Bangladesh and to promote peace and stability among fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations on the subcontinent. However, much more needs to be done. In such a vast undertaking it is essential that all partners have the full support and co-operation of the others. For this practical reason, New Zealand believes it is important that Bangladesh should be admitted to the United Nations as soon as possible.
178.	By a happy coincidence, the agreement between India and Pakistan was followed almost immediately by one between two other Asian neighbors, North and South Korea. That agreement opens the way for the deep and bitter hostilities of the past to be worked out by the Koreans themselves. In due course the Organization will no doubt have a role to play. At this juncture, however, we believe that the Assembly took a very wise decision when last week it deferred consideration of the Korean items [2036th meeting], thereby acknowledging that the two Koreas should have the opportunity, and should be encouraged, to come to terms with each other.
179.	The movement in Asia towards reconciliation has not so far been reflected in Indochina and VietNam, in Laos and in the Khmer Republic but it is not for want of effort on the part of South Vietnam and its friends. The United States has offered to withdraw all its forces in return for an internationally supervised cease-fire and the return of the American prisoners. The United States and South Viet-Nam together have offered to hold new elections in which the national liberation front can take its full part in organizing the elections and to have the elections internationally supervised. President Thieu of South Vietnam has offered to resign before the elections take place. My Government supports these proposals, which are directed towards obtaining a just and durable peace settlement in that part of the world.
180.	The encouragement that countries have had this year to seek a peaceful resolution of their differences has also been reflected in the Pacific region. New Zealand, Australia and a number of newly independent small nations of the South Pacific have been developing a very real spirit of community and co-operation. More recently the most outstanding evidence of this spirit has been the creation of what is known as the South Pacific Forum. In that Forum the government leaders of Fiji, Tonga, Western Samoa, Nauru, the Cook Islands, Australia and New Zealand have met together to discuss issues of practical interest to our Governments and peoples. As was mentioned by my Australian colleague yesterday, Papua New Guinea has been invited to observe the next meeting. The first Forum, held in Wellington in August last year, has been followed in 1972 by two further meetings, one in Canberra, Australia, and the other in Suva, Fiji. Talks have covered a very wide range of subjects. However, it is a measure of the Forum's concern with immediate practical issues that it has already established a South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation. This is a serious effort to stimulate new thinking and create greater opportunities for the development of trade and economic advancement throughout that vast area of the Pacific Ocean, particularly in the south.
181.	There is scope for a much greater involvement by the United Nations in the economic progress of the developing countries and the newly independent countries of the South Pacific. Perhaps because of their geographical remoteness, the problems of these countries too have seemed remote to other countries. Yet only a very little more attention, as measured in the total United Nations effort, would do so much more for these small and isolated communities. For that reason we are very pleased that the Asian Development Bank has accepted the independent island nations of the South Pacific as members and that loans are already being made available to them. Also, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is becoming increasingly involved in the development of the island nations, as are the United Nations Development Program, UNICEF and the specialized agencies concerned. However, I repeat that there is still much more to be done in that area.
182.	Over the years, New Zealand has involved the United Nations in the process of decolonization as it applied to New Zealand's island Territories. Some years ago we invited the United Nations missions to observe the act of self- determination in the former Trust Territory of Western Samoa, and also in the Cook Islands. This year the Assembly will have a report from a visiting mission of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which at New Zealand's invitation visited the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Nive [A/8723/Rev. 1, chap. XVI, annex I]. That mission was under the able leadership of Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. In my own Government's view, the report of the Committee is a very well-balanced, fair and, we believe, helpful document. We hope it will do more than enable the Assembly to consider the political issues to which the report itself was directed. It should also lead to a greater understanding of the special problems of survival and development faced by other very small dependent Territories.
183.	A minute ago I touched upon the remoteness of the problems of the South Pacific as seen by the rest of the world, and perhaps especially by the European countries. I draw attention now to the serious apprehension which exists in that vast area about the continuance of nuclear testing in the Pacific region.
184.	There is a regional concern because this year a further series of nuclear tests was conducted in the Tuamoto archipelago, and that is the fifth such series since 1967. My Government is aware that the problem of nuclear weapons testing is a global one and that nuclear tests are at present being conducted by four different nations. We also realize that nuclear testing is a part of the wider problem of the nuclear arms race. But I want to make it quite clear here today that the continuation of atmospheric nuclear testing in French Polynesia is deeply resented by the people of the whole of the South Pacific region and, indeed, of the North Pacific as well.
185.	At its meeting in Fiji earlier this month, the South Pacific Forum that I spoke of earlier unanimously expressed its deep concern that the French Government, in conducting its latest nuclear tests, should have failed to recognize the wishes of the people of the South Pacific area, despite the views so clearly expressed by the Governments and the peoples of those countries. The Forum strongly reaffirmed its opposition to all such nuclear experiments anywhere in the world.
186.	In support of that standpoint, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, referred to again this afternoon, has asked all States intending to carry out nuclear weapons tests to abandon those plans.  Countries in Asia, and in Latin America bordering the Pacific, have declared their total opposition. It is our intention to seek the Assembly's endorsement of these calls to cease all nuclear weapons testing.
187.	Nuclear testing is an issue on which the smaller States have had to speak bluntly to some of the larger Powers whose activities affect us.
188.	In the debate last year [1955th meeting], the New Zealand representative spoke of the great Powers taking policy decisions that profoundly affect the economic stability of smaller nations. There is still a pressing need for the great Powers to recognize that smaller economies can rock dangerously in the waves of their major-policy decisions. There is still a pressing need for a further liberalization of world trade and monetary matters. New Zealand attaches considerable importance to a successful outcome of the multilateral trade negotiations under the framework of GATT in 1973. The Kennedy Round failed to meet our hopes.
189.	New Zealand, like so many other, smaller countries, is heavily dependent on trade in primary agricultural commodities. We are vitally concerned, on that account, with the progress that will have to be made with eliminating or reducing barriers to trade in agricultural products. The developing countries quite rightly want to have their say in these talks, in these negotiations, in these kinds of decisions. Like us, they are less interested in tariff reductions on industrial products, which seem to be the pervading preoccupation of such talks, than in primary products. There are few benefits for smaller and developing nations in enhancing the economic advantages of the great industrial Powers. But I urge the need for less international charity and more true international economic reality.
190.	I suggested that the past year has seen the advent of a more favorable general political climate. Unfortunately, it will also be remembered as a year in which the resort to terrorism, individual killing of totally innocent and unsuspecting people, mass cruelty, mistreatment, and even genocide, have left a very tragic mark. Private violence as a means of influencing issues between States must be condemned as strongly as State violence against States, which of course is proscribed by our Charter.
191.	The revulsion to which violence gives rise, in the minds of all people throughout the world, renders these horrible actions politically sterile and useless, indeed counterproductive. It does not further the cause which they variously profess to espouse. Take two outstanding examples: those who claim to speak for the Palestinian and the Croatian peoples. What this violence does do is to increase the readiness of Governments to concert their actions to halt this scourge throughout the world.
192.	The New Zealand Government approves the efforts made by the Secretary-General to seek a greater awakening of the United Nations interest in these horrible actions and events.
193.	In the field of human rights, the right to life and security of person must have first place in anyone's scale of priorities. Nobody will underestimate the difficulties of grappling with the subject of international terrorism. Yet, it is surely right that this subject should be on our agenda. It will be a sad reflection on our strength of purpose and on the capacity of this Organization if no effective means can be found to eliminate the threat to innocent lives which this modern phenomenon presents.
194.	At the same time, we must not overlook other problems of human rights which may gravely affect very large numbers of people in particular areas of the world. The question of people of Asian origin expelled from Uganda is a case in point, as was already mentioned. My Government understands the wish of the Government of Uganda, or of any other Government, to ensure that the control of its economy remains largely in the hands of its own nationals. But there is more than one way of implementing such policy, and many countries have shown the way.
195.	The decision taken by the Uganda Government involves the abrupt wrenching from their own homes and the expulsion from the country of people who, for the most part, have that country as their only home and who spring from generations of people who haVe lived in that country. The New Zealand Government, which has offered a place in our own multiracial society to some of those expelled from Uganda, hopes that the Government of Uganda will even now reconsider the decision that it has taken. We would expect that, at the least, a more reasonable time limit for departure will be set and that, having regard to the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the persons concerned will be allowed to transfer from the country those assets to which they have an undoubted personal right. And so we strongly support the initiative taken by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom. My delegation, as you can see, is in favor of his request for the inclusion in the agenda of a new item entitled 'International implications of the expulsion of the Asian community from Uganda' [A/8794].
196.	Before I leave the subject of human rights I should like, only very briefly, to refer to three measures taken by the New Zealand Government which may be of interest to some countries represented in this Assembly. First, New Zealand has enacted its own Race Relations Act and should this year ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination [resolution 2106 A (XX), annex]. Secondly, our Government is this year passing legislation providing for the introduction of equal pay for women. New Zealand.was the first country in the world to give women the vote and so we are rather proud to be among the pioneers in making this further contribution to women's rights. The third measure I have in mind is a bill recently introduced in our Parliament which we hope will be passed this year and which will introduce a system whereby accident compensation amounting to 80 per cent of salary will be available to all employed persons who may suffer injury in any circumstances whatever, including accidents such as road accidents or any other kind of accident which is not related in any way to work at their jobs. We regard this as a major social advance and will be happy to provide details to any other countries which may be interested in it.
197.	A notable achievement in international co-operation of the best sort has been demonstrated in Stockholm where the Conference on the Human Environment alerted the world community to the dangers created in our environment by mankind's sometimes reckless use of the earth's resources. The fact of the Conference and its achievement is surely evidence of the vitality of this United Nations. I should like to place on record my Government's appreciation for the efforts made by Sweden as host Government to bring about the success of the Conference. We hope that the role played by Mr. Maurice Strong as Secretary-General of that Conference will be further recognized as we consider, I hope at this session, the setting up of new institutions, including a governing council for environmental programs and an environment fund. In anticipation of the Assembly's decision on the Fund, my Government will be prepared to contribute over a five-year period the sum of $320,000.
198.	The future crisis of world population, which will double by the year 2000, is inextricably linked with the problem of the world environment. Great tensions already exist in some parts of the world between populations and the space, natural resources and social structures available to them considerable stress. If these problems are not better understood now and dealt with in a pragmatic and, I hope, understanding way, we will be giving our children a legacy for which they will not thank us and in which we will take very little pride. Our Government is anxious to take its full share in international efforts which must move forward, we believe, speedily. We welcome the decision to hold the World Population Conference in 1974 [resolution 2683 (XXV)]. New Zealand will also continue, as we have in the past, to support the United Nations Fund for Population Activities which, after only two years, is already an active and worth-while agent of this Organization for this global endeavor.
199.	New Zealand has always 'been a staunch supporter of the United Nations. New Zealand has always constantly supported the concept of an active role for the Secretary- General, and I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to Mr. Waldheim. We commend his firm approach to financial and administrative problems and questions at a difficult time. We commend him for the forthright action he has taken to draw the Assembly's attention to the growing question of violence and terrorism. In many more ways also the Secretary-General this year has exercised energetically the powers of initiative with which his office is properly endowed. We trust that he will continue to do so and he is certainly assured of the support and co-operation of New Zealand in that role. 
200.	Again, Mr. President, I congratulate you in your high office. I wish you every success in your heavy and demanding task.
"
6893,27,1972,AUS,"Mr. President, I should like, on behalf of the Australian delegation, to add my congratulations upon your election as President of this General Assembly session. Our two countries are far apart geographically, but our peoples have had some common experiences which have given them, I believe, a respect and understanding of each other. With the exchange this year of diplomatic representatives, the relations between our two countries are entering a period of constructive and fruitful development. In your high office, to which you come with distinction and obvious talent, you may be assured of the full co-operation of the Australian delegation.
121.	I wish also to express my warm appreciation of the contribution made by the President of the twenty-sixth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Adam Malik of Indonesia, who brought to the office of President great charm and distinction, as well as wise counsel. Australia and Indonesia are close neighbors and we take special pleasure in recalling Mr. Malik's presidency.
122.	May I be permitted also to commend the dedication to his task that the Secretary-General has shown in his first year of office. The Australian delegation appreciates his distillation of the essence of his report in a short introduction. In this introduction [A/8701IAdd.l] he has set forth his determination to work actively for peaceful solutions to international problems. Most of what he has said in that brief explanation of his conception of the duties and objectives of the United Nations, and of his own responsibilities, will be accepted without qualification by my Government.
123.	Australia has been, not an uncritical, but a strong and consistent supporter of the United Nations. The purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter are basic to our foreign policy. This year Australia has decided to stand for election to membership in the Security Council. This is evidence of our willingness to accept our share of the general responsibilities of United Nations membership and of our belief that we can represent in a significant sense the Asian and Pacific region.
124.	Throughout our participation in the work of this Organization, Australia has sought to find ways by which the Charter and the United Nations as an institution can be used more effectively for reducing world tensions and for bringing increased harmony and stability into the international system. We do not seek a simply static world order; we seek one which can encompass even rapid change. But we firmly believe that change should take place always in a peaceful and orderly way. Most nations will acknowledge that the United Nations has not yet made sufficient progress in stabilizing international political relations within a generally acceptable code of international rules. Around the world we continue to face the tragic results of attempts to settle disputes and impose political solutions by force and terror and violence.
125.	We believe that the functioning of any society of men or nations, if it is to be peaceably and soundly based, must depend upon the effective working of a rule of law that is generally understood, generally accepted and generally respected. It is true to say that the work of the United Nations rests on the twin pillars of international law and justice. There can be no more constructive way of contributing to the strength of the United Nations than to look for opportunities of broadening and deepening its involvement in new areas of common international concern, with the object of widening the scope and, I would hope, the acceptability of a just and realistic code of international behavior.
126.	We have before us the question whether the Charter might need some revision. We all have in mind that it was drawn up at the end of the Second World War in circumstances that have since undergone substantial transformation. We can all agree that the Charter falls short of perfection. But as an enduring statement of political concepts and values, it has stood the test of time remarkably well. Its potential for practical implementation that will lead us to a well-ordered world system is still very far from exhausted. 
127.	My Government would be prepared to support amendments to specific Articles of the Charter which might now be out of date or in other respects now irrelevant, if there were a substantial measure of agreement on the proposed changes. That might be reason to question, for example, whether the wording of Article 23, paragraph 1, makes it possible to ensure that the original intent of that provision is carried out in full. We are not, however, attracted to the idea of wholesale review. There are too many differences of opinion for such a review to be certainly profitable. We would not favor the convening of a large conference which might result in division and dissension and which might even diminish respect for the present Charter without offering any certain prospect of an acceptable alternative. The damage to the United Nations could well be difficult to repair.
128.	The program of work for this session offers us opportunities to help the United Nations to establish a world system in which agreed international laws and practices will prevail. Not all of these are equally mature for treatment by this General Assembly, but each offers some scope for removing inequalities and harmonizing relations between States.
129.	The maintenance of international peace and security must remain the basic purpose of the United Nations. Australia, for its part, continues to be actively involved in United Nations peace-keeping functions, both in the field and here at Headquarters. As a member of the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations, we regret the failure of the Committee to make any substantial progress in recent years and its virtual stagnation during 1972. It is an unhappy commentary on the state of multilateral diplomacy within our Organization that the impasse reached on matters of substance is such that Members can conceive and develop no initiative which may offer a possible breakthrough and enable the Committee to carry out its mandate.
130.	So long as we are unable to keep the peace, Governments will feel they need to go armed in a potentially hostile world. The crushing burden and the gruesome threat of modern armories are thus a symptom of our failure to create the well-ordered world system which remains the basic purpose of the United Nations. This in the final analysis must await agreement on effective measures of arms limitation and control. In respect of the items on this year's agenda, Australia will continue to support any genuinely constructive measures that promise to contribute to the climate of world peace.
131.	In this spirit, the Australian Government welcomes the fact that the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks have advanced to agreement, if not yet to finality. We welcome the entry into force of the treaty on arms control on the sea-bed. Australia was also able to sign on 10 April last, the day on which it was opened for signature, the Convention to ban biological weapons of war.  We would also certainly support the convening, at the appropriate time and after full and careful preparation, of a world disarmament conference that could bring together all nations, and particularly all those more powerful nations whose consensus will be imperative in the words of the Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.
132.	Australia would particularly like to see the negotiation of a comprehensive treaty, with effective provisions for verification and control, to prohibit the conduct of nuclear weapons testing in all environments by all States. The first step towards that objective should be, in our view, the universal acceptance and application of the existing Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water. But we still do not have universal acceptance of this treaty, and there is still no halt to nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere.
133.	Those peoples, including my own, that live in and around the Pacific Ocean have made clear their strong opposition to these tests. Australia and New Zealand have taken a joint initiative in calling together a meeting of nations bordering on the Pacific Ocean that have raised their voices against nuclear weapons testing for the purpose of discussing this matter. Our first meeting proved constructive and useful. We hope, as a result, that we shall, with a substantial body of sponsors, be able to bring forward a meaningful resolution at an appropriate time during the current session.
134.	I move now from nuclear terror to plain human terror. In saying this I am, of course, aware that a debate has already taken place here on the question whether or not this Assembly should embark upon a discussion of terrorism and how to put an end to it.
135.	My Government welcomed the initiative of the Secretary-General in seeking the inclusion in the agenda of an item designed to give us an opportunity to discuss terrorism [A/8791 and Add.lJ. This item has been included [item 92]. It is for all of us now to seek practical and effective ways of containing terrorism. The Secretary- General has rightly stressed the humanitarian aspects of the problem, and particularly its impact on innocent bystanders and non-participants.
136.	I want to make it clear that I do not have in mind any one particular terrorist act. My Government understands fully the kinds of frustration, grievance and despair that can lead particular groups and individuals to embark on desperate enterprises designed to hold persons, often innocent persons, or even Governments to ransom. But there are two things that must be said about the growing incidence of this world-wide pattern of intimidation by terrorism, whether it takes the form of the abduction or killing of diplomats or private individuals, or the hijacking of aircraft, or political assassination. The first is that however deplorable it is that disputes between groups or countries should escalate to the point of violence and terrorism, it becomes intolerable when the side effects of these disputes begin to appear in the harassment of Governments and the endangering of the lives of innocent people in countries that are not involved, and have no reason to be involved, in those disputes. The second point I want to make is that terror creates terror, that terrorism does not solve problems but breeds more terrorism within and among nations. If terrorism is allowed to go unchecked it must lead ultimately towards anarchy, national as well as international. It is, therefore, a matter of concern to every Member of the United Nations. The reputation of the United Nations as a whole will be gravely affected if the Organization is seen to shrink from facing the problem.
137.	The Australian Government, in consultation with other Governments, has been examining possible ways of countering terrorist violence against innocent parties. We hope that the Assembly will treat this as a matter of urgency and reach early agreement on measures that may take us at least part of the way towards the solution of a problem which we recognize is full of difficulty for many Member countries, but which nevertheless demands immediate action. Looking further ahead, my delegation has had in mind the possibility of an international convention aimed at outlawing acts of violence and intimidation which arise essentially from local conflicts but which are in effect directed primarily at innocent people and uninvolved Governments. The problem is full of complexity, and there is more than one way of tackling it. The United States Secretary of State has put before us a draft convention on the subject [A/C.6/L.850], which we shall all of us wish to study with great care. Another possible suggestion that my Government has had in mind is that the International Law Commission might be asked to draft the provisions of such a convention. But these proposals are for the longer term, and are no substitute for the urgent action that is demanded by public and private opinion everywhere for effective preventive measures to defeat the indiscriminate threat of terrorism.
138.	The threat is universal. It has reached us in Australia in forms no less grave than elsewhere. A bomb that exploded two weeks ago in a main street of our biggest city, at the entrance of an agency of a European Government, left 16 innocent people injured, some of them critically. Only two days ago some half-dozen of the so-called letter bombs were discovered in the central post office in Canberra. I mention both these incidents only to show how the manifestations of terrorism germinated from local grievances in any quarter of the world can threaten innocent people in countries many thousands of miles away.
139.	My Government regards all acts of that kind as utterly abhorrent to our way of life. When acts of terrorism occur in Australia, we are determined to use all our resources to apprehend and prosecute the offenders. We are equally determined that, so far as it lies within our power, we will prevent our country from being used at any time as a base for terrorist acts in any other country. We join other nations in condemning not only acts of terrorism, but also those acts of violent retaliation, understandable as they may be, which in themselves carry the seeds of escalation into further terrorism.
140.	The increasing incidence of aircraft hijacking and other kinds of criminal interference with air travel constitutes only one manifestation of the insidious effects of terror by example. More often than not its effects reach beyond the limits of jurisdiction of any single country. This means that it can be contained and ultimately eradicated only by a stringent combination of domestic and internationally agreed penalties. A beginning has been made in the form of the conclusion of three Conventions to deal with this problem, all three of which my Government has either ratified or is in the process of ratifying. But there is obviously more to be done before innocent travelers in every country in the world can feel sure that they can take to the air without the risk of placing their lives at the mercy of human terror.
141.	I think we all recognize that a well-ordered system of international behavior depends not only on dedication to accepted and established principles but also on the measure of detailed agreement we can reach on the many practical matters that affect the daily transactions of peoples and governments everywhere.
142.	One of these practical matters concerns the seas and the resources that lie in and underneath them. The United Nations is now preparing for a conference on the law of the sea. This conference could be one of the most important of this decade. The Australian Government, as a member of the committee responsible for preparing this conference, is pleased at the progress the committee has made.
143.	We welcome the growing acceptance in that committee of the view that the new law of the sea should accord greater recognition than is at present given by international law to the interests of coastal States in the resources, the quality of the environment, and the conduct of scientific research in the seas and sea-bed adjacent to them but beyond their territorial waters. If this is reflected in the final convention, it should be possible to confine the Territorial sea to a breadth of 12 miles and to devise a satisfactory regime for passage through straits used for international navigation. This would be a progressive development of the law, in the best sense.
144.	We have spoken of our desire for a peaceful and well-ordered world. We also want a world in which the preservation of a healthy environment goes hand in hand with material progress. Australia recognizes the need for international conventions in this field, most immediately in the field of control over marine pollution. We look forward to further progress as a result of the Conference on Marine Pollution to be organized by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization in 1973, and from the continuing valuable studies of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
145.	The most significant achievement so far in our efforts to preserve the global environment has, of course, been the encouraging outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Stockholm. Australia will support the adoption by the General Assembly of the Conference's reports and the recommendations contained therein. At the same time we remain conscious of the fears among developing countries that the preservation of the environment might come to assume priority within the United Nations over the continuing need for assistance for .economic development. And we respect this concern. We consider that protection of the environment and economic development must go hand in hand, and must not be regarded as mutually exclusive or competitive.
146.	Australia supports the proposal to establish a governing council for environmental programs.  I believe that Australia can make a valuable contribution to the work of this Council. We will seek election to that body at this session of the Assembly and we have already announced a pledge of $2.5 million to the voluntary Environment Fund.
147.	I have so far be ^n dealing with matters which directly affect us all. I should now like to bring to the Assembly some of the significant developments affecting international relations in the Asian and Pacific region.
148.	One of the most exciting developments in our own area is the rapid movement towards self-government and independence of Papua New Guinea. The third Papua New Guinea House of Assembly was elected in March of this year and has now voted in favor of Papua New Guinea becoming fully self-governing on 1 December 1973 or as soon as possible thereafter. Independence will follow when the House of Assembly decides the time is right. The transition to independence by a people is an inspiring and important achievement, and I hope that the close and friendly relationship that continues between Australia and Papua New Guinea will provide convincing evidence of success in our efforts in helping to bring that country to the point of self-determination.
149.	It is a short step from Papua New Guinea to the islands of the South Pacific ocean, and just before coming to New York I attended in Suva the third meeting of the South Pacific Forum, in which Government leaders of independent countries in the region now meet regularly to review common problems. It was agreed at the Suva meeting that countries like Papua New Guinea which were on the threshold of self-government or independence and wished to become members of the Forum could participate as observers until such time as they became self-governing or independent. Papua New Guinea will consequently be able to attend the next meeting of the South Pacific Forum as an observer.
150.	This Forum, offering, as it does, an opportunity for frank discussion and consultation on the widest range of common problems, has already become a significant and influential regional body. The Pacific countries are actively seeking understanding and co-operation through consultation. Their efforts are a conspicuous example of the effective application of the principles of the United Nations Charter. As an indication of Australia's interest in assisting the countries of the South Pacific we have increased our development aid to the region to the figure of $A 15 million over the next three years.
151.	I have devoted some little time to Australia's relations with the island communities to our east, across the South Pacific, mainly because all those communities are now beginning to establish their own individual identity. This does not, of course, mean that there has been any diminution in the constant attention we in Australia give to our relations with our neighbor countries to our north to the countries of South-East and East Asia. These relationships continue to prosper in the same frank and cordial atmosphere that has prevailed since they achieved independence. Our bilateral relations with each of them are good. We enjoy very satisfactory multilateral associations with a number of them; and they are establishing closer links among and between themselves through organizations such as ASEAN—the Association of South-East Asian Nations which promises to contribute substantially to the peace and stability of the region.
152.	The exception to peace in South-East Asia is Indochina, where the merciless and needless destruction and suffering caused by the now undisguised aggression of North Viet-Nam continue to appall the world. We can only appeal to the leaders in the North to take stock of the terrible havoc this war has wrought. Realization is long overdue that serious negotiation does not signify weakness, that a negotiated settlement does not signify defeat and that it is not impossible for different ideologies eventually to coexist in peace and prosperity.
153.	My Government fully supports the terms of the offer made by the President of the United States in May of this year as a practical basis for ending the military conflict, and we can only hope that that offer, or one like it, will ultimately prove to hold the key to real progress not only towards a cease-fire but also towards an agreed settlement that will bring an end to the miseries of the long-suffering people of South Viet-Nam and also of their neighbors in Laos and the Khmer Republic.
154.	Australia had hoped that at this session of the General Assembly we should be able to welcome to the Organization as a new Member Bangladesh, with which Australia has especially friendly links. We believe that Bangladesh is fully qualified for membership in the United Nations. We remain hopeful that the Security Council, upon reconsideration of the matter, will recommend in favor of the Bangladesh application and that as a result the Assembly will still be able at its present session to admit this new State to the world body as a full Member.
155.	In passing, may I compliment the Secretary-General on the impressive way in which his office has tackled the enormous problem of co-ordinating relief for Bangladesh. Independent reports from Dacca testify to the expedition and efficiency with which relief aid valued at more than $200 million has been made available to Bangladesh by the United Nations Relief Operation in Dacca since the end of last year.
156.	The economic problems facing Bangladesh exemplify the need for greater assistance on more favorable terms to the developing world. Australia this year is committed to provide $US 260 million in international aid, an increase of 10 per cent over expenditure in the previous financial year. Together with private capital flows, the net transfer of resources to developing countries this year will account for an estimated 1.27 per cent of Australia's gross national product. Australia continues to be among the first three or four donor countries in the amount of official development assistance extended in relation to gross national product, and almost all Australian aid is given in the form of grants. 
Among other increases, Australia will be raising its contribution to the United Nations Development Program this year by 20 per cent.
157.	Before concluding, I should refer briefly to the financial position of the United Nations. We believe it remains a vital task for each of us to assist in finding a solution to the Organization's debt problem. We hope that real progress will be made when the question is taken up this year in the Fifth Committee.
158.	We welcome the steps taken by the Secretary-General to restrain budgetary increases. Australia wants to see each year a budget adequate to support the expanding work- program of the Organization. But that does not mean that every new program or project, however well intentioned, is to be accepted regardless of its cost. The United Nations, like other institutions, has to establish its priorities in the knowledge that not every fresh activity can be accommodated in the budget at one and the same time.
159. I have spoken about the role of the United Nations in maintaining a stable, harmonious world order, and about particular situations within and outside the immediate purview of the United Nations which closely affect my country. In all these situations there is a challenge to the United Nations, which means a challenge to all of us here. Let us hope we can accept that challenge.
"
7000,61,2006,AUS,"I would like to begin by 
joining with my colleagues in congratulating Ms. Haya 
Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of 
the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am 
also delighted to welcome Montenegro as the 192nd 
Member of the United Nations.  
 I also note that this will be the tenth and, indeed, 
the final General Assembly for the Secretary-General. I 
want to congratulate him on his important contribution 
to the United Nations over his term and also 
throughout his United Nations career. He has been a 
very good colleague of Australia throughout that time. 
He has been a determined advocate for peace, 
development and United Nations reform, and we wish 
him well in the future. 
 Earlier this month, on the day before the fifth 
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks against the United 
States, a man called Hakim Taniwal was murdered by a 
suicide bomber in Afghanistan. 
 Mr. Taniwal was the Governor of Paktia province 
in eastern Afghanistan. He was a scholarly, gentle-
spoken man of integrity — a good man, with a 
reputation as a highly capable administrator. As well as 
being an Afghani, Mr. Taniwal was an Australian. He 
lived in exile in my country for some years and built a 
new life for his family. 
 But when Afghanistan was liberated from the 
Taliban in the wake of 9/11, Mr. Taniwal returned to 
help rebuild his homeland. He worked for the 
betterment of his fellow Afghans by adopting a 
forward-looking model of public administration, far 
removed from the Taliban narrative of rule by fear. For 
his trouble, the Taliban had him killed. His nephew 
died alongside him. A few days later, compounding 
atrocity upon atrocity, a second suicide bomber 
attacked Mr. Taniwal’s funeral ceremony, killing and 
injuring many more people. 
 The task of rebuilding Afghanistan, in the face of 
such atrocities, is demanding great sacrifices on the 
part of tens of thousands of brave men and women. It 
is a country in which many of the great challenges of 
our time intersect: how to free its cities, towns and 
villages from the daily threat of violence; how to 
ensure that an extremist ideology never again 
subjugates the country’s institutions; and how to create 
the conditions for stability and good governance so 
necessary to economic renewal and so crucial if its 
people are to escape poverty and oppression. 
 Afghanistan represents a fundamental test for 
each of us. If we are not resolute and steadfast in 
supporting Afghanistan against the scourge of 
terrorism, and if we are not prepared collectively to 
stand up against the extremists, we will deliver to 
coming generations a weak international system and a 
far less secure and stable world. 
 Iraq is another of the front lines in this battle. I 
acknowledge here the divided views of United Nations 
Member States over the military action against the 
regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, yet today there is a 
very clear choice that should unite us all. 
 The extremists have chosen to make Iraq a 
battleground. Osama bin Laden has said that Iraq is 
“for you or for us to win”. We know what will come of 
Iraq if it is won by the extremists. As in Afghanistan, 
we must all commit to securing its future. Iraq is not 
America’s burden alone, and Afghanistan is not 
NATO’s burden alone, because if terrorism prevailed, 
the consequences would be catastrophic for each of us, 
wherever we may live. 
 This struggle will be protracted. Our challenge is 
not just to keep our citizens safe from terrorist attack; 
it is also to defeat an ideology that allows for no ideas 
or belief systems other than its own. It is imperative we 
see this ideology clearly for what it is: a mindset every 
bit as brutal and uncompromising as its totalitarian 
predecessors in centuries past. It is an ideology that 
  
 
06-53005 34 
 
directly challenges the principles and values of 
modernity — the flourishing of open markets, open 
societies and open minds. To defeat this evil, we must 
harness the collective strength of the international 
community. 
 I welcome the recent agreement on the United 
Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, but I am 
disappointed that the Strategy’s illustrative list of 
conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism did not 
include extremist ideologies. 
 Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic (Croatia), Vice-President, 
took the Chair. 
 We need to do much more. States should 
conclude a comprehensive convention on international 
terrorism. That would demonstrate an unambiguous 
commitment, ensuring that all terrorist acts are 
criminalized in international law. It is disappointing 
that the United Nations still cannot agree on the scope 
of such a convention. 
 More disturbingly, some countries continue to 
sponsor terrorist groups to promote their own political 
agendas. In the Middle East, it is essential that all 
countries, including Iran and Syria, use their influence 
over organizations such as Hezbollah to stop terrorist 
assaults, including those directed at the State of Israel. 
Any viable resolution of the conflict must include 
Hezbollah’s disarmament, its renunciation of violence 
and a recognition of Israel’s right to exist in peace. 
 In all of this, the United Nations has a role to 
play. But, as I have said before in this Hall, the United 
Nations is not the answer to all the problems of the 
world. Where the United Nations cannot act, individual 
States must. Our membership in the United Nations 
does not absolve any of us from the responsibility to 
show leadership and to pursue practical solutions. 
 Too often in the world of politics, the temptation 
is for Governments to strike an attitude and then leave 
the substantive action for another day, or to offload the 
responsibility onto others. We can make solemn 
pledges — as we should, and we do — to work much 
harder to assist developing nations in confronting the 
ravages of poverty and disease. We can sign high-
minded manifestos to protect our environment from the 
risk of climate change. Alongside global security, these 
are two issues crucial to our collective future. But so 
much of the talk is mere artifice unless backed up by 
resolute, practical and well-constructed policy 
responses. 
 In Australia’s region, practical and effective 
cooperation has exemplified the counter-terrorism 
response. A regional training centre jointly established 
by Indonesia and Australia is helping South-East Asian 
law enforcement agencies develop the capabilities they 
need to destroy terrorist networks. Other recent 
initiatives, such as interfaith dialogues, are promoting 
tolerance and mutual understanding. 
 Practical and effective cooperation has also been 
the hallmark of our commitment to East Timor. 
Australian Defence Force personnel and police worked 
with their counterparts from New Zealand, Malaysia 
and Portugal to restore order after the April riots. We 
remain ready to continue to provide a significant 
“green helmet” military contingent in East Timor to 
complement the United Nations police force mandated 
under Security Council resolution 1704 (2006). 
 Elsewhere in our region, Australia has joined in a 
partnership with 14 other Pacific countries in a 
Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands 
(RAMSI). RAMSI is not just about restoring law and 
order; some 150 advisers are working with the 
Solomon Islands Government, helping to stabilize 
finances, revitalize the public service and strengthen 
the justice and prison systems. None of these tasks is 
easy, and much more remains to be done, but the hard 
work has begun, and we are making headway. 
 In contrast, the tragedy of Darfur poses a 
grievous challenge to the international community. 
Darfur is a litmus test of the responsibility of the 
United Nations to help people who desperately need its 
protection. It is a test of the most basic principles of 
civilization. We all know this. We also know it is a test 
that, so far, the United Nations has failed. 
 In this Hall last year, we assumed a solemn 
responsibility to protect those who have no means of 
protecting themselves. The United Nations itself must 
now redouble its efforts to try to prevent any further 
bloodshed in Darfur, which has already claimed well in 
excess of 200,000 lives and brought about the 
displacement of millions of persons. The United 
Nations must keep its promise to the people of Darfur. 
It is no less than they should expect and no less than 
we would demand. 
 
 
35 06-53005 
 
 The desperation of Darfur reminds us also of the 
immense challenges of development. Members of the 
United Nations have recognized this through the 
Millennium Development Goals. Aid is important, and 
last year Australia committed itself to doubling our 
annual aid budget to about $4 billion a year by 2010. 
Australia has recently sharpened the focus of our 
development assistance programme on supporting good 
governance, basic social services and security in 
developing countries. In the South Pacific, we will 
sponsor new programmes to train people in technical 
and entrepreneurial skills.  
 But increasing aid and reducing debt burdens 
alone will not reduce poverty. Economic growth is 
central to poverty alleviation. The World Bank 
estimates that the number of people living on less than 
$2 a day in East Asia fell by around 280 million 
between 2001 and 2005. The policies and actions of 
developing countries in creating an enabling 
environment for economic growth are fundamental to 
advances on this front. Likewise, free and open trade 
and investment are pivotal. The failure of the Doha 
Round of multilateral trade talks would be a cruel 
rebuff to the world’s poor. The World Bank estimates 
that a strong outcome of the Round could lift an 
additional 32 million people out of poverty by 2015. 
 We cannot underpin sustainable economic 
development without protecting the environment on 
which we depend. Biodiversity loss, land clearing, 
deforestation and climate change present threats to the 
common good that can best be overcome through 
collective action. 
 But collective action entails much more than 
adopting resolutions and signing treaties. Fine words 
and high aspirations may give us a sense that we are 
acting to stop environmental degradation, but they are 
of little benefit unless backed by practical action. 
Domestic implementation of environmental 
commitments has not been sufficient, and the gap 
between words and action remains too wide. 
 Climate change is an area where we must move 
beyond blind faith in a single multilateral approach. 
The great challenge is to address climate change 
without jeopardizing economic growth, particularly in 
developing countries. We need to work towards a more 
inclusive and effective international approach to 
climate change. The existing efforts are not enough; we 
need to bring forward new ideas, not constrained by 
ideology.  
 The focus of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on 
Clean Development and Climate is the development 
and transfer of cleaner energy-generating technologies. 
The Partnership brings together Australia, the United 
States, Japan, China, India and the Republic of Korea. 
Together, those countries account for about half of the 
world’s gross domestic product, population, energy use 
and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of the 
Partnership is to bring developed and developing 
countries together with the private sector to deploy 
technologies — be they renewable energy or carbon 
storage — to help reduce the dangers of climate 
change, while not stalling economic growth and 
development. 
 Effective international action on the great global 
challenges of our time requires more than resolutions 
at the United Nations. It requires the exercise of strong 
leadership by individual nations. It requires proactive 
policy, not political posturing or personal abuse from 
this rostrum. It requires a rigorous search for sound and 
practical long-term solutions. 
 As Members of the United Nations, we have 
pledged to unite our strengths to maintain international 
peace and security. But, equally, we cannot abrogate to 
the United Nations the responsibility that we have, as 
individual States, for security and good governance 
within our borders and within our regions. History will 
judge us harshly if we do not shoulder that 
responsibility. "
7011,61,2006,VUT,"Today, we stand on the 
verge of global uncertainty. The international 
landscape is scarred by wars, conflict, civil unrest, 
epidemics, drought and famine. Poverty and 
malnutrition continue to ravage the lives of millions of 
the world’s inhabitants. 
 The very values and fabric on which the United 
Nations was founded are being besieged by new ideas 
and principles that are undermining the authority of 
this body to maintain global peace and security. The 
clash of ideologies and of cultural and religious 
differences continues to give much food for thought. 
The United Nations stands at a crossroads. While it has 
the mandate to address those challenges, it remains 
paralysed as a result of actions taken by the hegemonic 
Powers of today. That is the dilemma confronting the 
Organization. 
 The value of the human person and his or her 
right to live in a world that is fair and just seems but a 
dream. Ensuring the dignity of one’s right to live with 
access to the most basic necessities in life remains our 
greatest challenge. We speak so ambitiously of creating 
a world that is equitable and just, but the outcomes 
have been unimpressive. 
 The schism between the minority rich and the 
majority poor continues to grow. The multitudes of the 
disadvantaged are being further marginalized from the 
so-called benefits of globalization. Fear has struck 
many small countries of the developing world. It is not 
the fear that the developing world has no capabilities in 
contributing to peace and security, but the fear — the 
greatest fear, in fact — that the undemocratic practices 
of the major United Nations organs, such as the 
Security Council, are causing tension and disarray in 
the work of the United Nations. 
 The disparities in the quality of life between the 
haves and the have-nots have grown to be fertile 
breeding grounds for new and hostile generations. And 
it is here that the phenomenon of terrorism continues to 
challenge the frontiers of our imagination. It is perhaps 
much clearer today than ever before that there are 
reasons for increased resentment in certain parts of the 
world. 
 My Government condemns terrorism in whatever 
form or manifestation it assumes, and there is an urgent 
need for all the Members of the United Nations to work 
together openly in combating those dangerous 
developments. The destruction of innocent lives should 
not be the means to meeting an end. That is inhumane. 
All United Nations Member countries therefore have 
the responsibility — a moral and ethical 
responsibility — to eradicate that menace from the face 
of the Earth. 
  
 
06-53615 2 
 
 Peace cannot be won through injustice, the 
practice of double standards, aggression or war. We 
cannot be victorious in the fight against terrorism if we 
fail to address its root causes. Conversely, it is 
incumbent on all Member States to act responsibly to 
ensure the implementation of all United Nations 
resolutions. Moreover, if we are to have any hope of 
building a better future, then peace must sometimes 
come at a price. 
 We must begin to look deeply, honestly and with 
open hearts if we are really to understand the world 
around us. If there is a question of repressive policies 
that influence and dominate the international economic 
and political order, then those concerned must take 
remedial action. The adoption of the resolution on the 
United Nation’s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is 
therefore a positive step forward. 
 The central focus on the fight against terrorism 
has taken centre stage for some, and the diversion of 
resources is jeopardizing the realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals and official 
development assistance target levels. Accessibility to 
the markets of the affluent nations has also restricted 
the progress of development in many countries of the 
developing world. Major world players must not lose 
sight of those goals. 
 Inter-State relations, mutual understanding and 
tolerance begin with respect for the individual. The 
dignity of the human person is of the essence in 
building equality between all persons. That is one of 
the fundamental principles of the United Nations. As 
Members of the United Nations, we have all agreed to 
embrace those principles and we continue to believe in 
those values. Vanuatu joined the United Nations in 
1981 because it believed in the Organization. Today, I 
stand before the Assembly to again reaffirm faith in the 
United Nations, but I agree that changes must take 
place to adapt the United Nations system to the 
evolution of the international and geopolitical and 
economic framework. 
 Reforms of the various United Nations bodies are 
therefore absolutely essential. There must be reform of 
the Security Council to ensure that it is democratic and 
more representative of the United Nations membership. 
The veto power in the Council dilutes all the good 
intentions of the majority of the United Nations 
membership towards addressing many of the 
challenges confronting us today. The underlying 
question, though, is: Has the disproportionate use of 
the veto power sustained reasonable levels of 
international peace and stability? 
 Cultural and religious differences cannot be seen 
to be obstacles in that regard. The United Nations 
brought civility and etiquette to the conduct of 
relations between States, and central to that are 
relations between individuals. The art of statesmanship 
has therefore become very critical at this time. Respect 
must therefore begin here at the United Nations. When 
one world Power speaks here, this Hall is jammed. 
Thereafter, the debate becomes routine. That is remiss 
of many of us. The annual general debate of the 
General Assembly is the only practical occasion at 
which almost all leaders are together in one place to 
discuss and share views on the development challenges 
facing the globe. The United Nations is not about one 
or several nations; it is about this family of nations 
with the one common objective of maintaining 
international peace and security. 
 Over the past few days, millions around the globe 
have monitored the unfolding debate in this noble Hall 
of the General Assembly. A war of words has 
resounded from this rostrum, exposing an alarming rift 
in relations between some super-Powers and the voices 
of the developing world. The media have exploited the 
situation to scrutinize those events, often ending up 
with gross assumptions and conclusions that have only 
instilled fear amongst the world’s innocent population. 
Now, is that the right message of hope we are giving to 
our peoples, who have faith in the United Nations? Is 
the United Nations not the beacon of hope for all 
humanity? 
 Confrontation must be resolved through tactful 
diplomacy and negotiation consistent with the purposes 
and principles of the United Nations Charter and 
established international law. In that spirit, we also 
appeal to those concerned to exercise great restraint 
and to have the wisdom and responsibility to ensure 
above all that any action they take serves that purpose, 
which must be in the interest of future global justice, 
peace and security. Any retreat from multilateralism 
will result only in increased tension and aggression. 
Again, mutual dialogue through appropriate 
mechanisms is absolutely critical at this very delicate 
time. 
 On the question of the Middle East, both Israel 
and Palestine have the right to live side by side in 
 
 
3 06-53615 
 
peaceful coexistence as independent and sovereign 
States. The international community must be realistic 
about the future. Let us allow justice, security and 
long-lasting peace to prevail for both the Israeli people 
and the Palestinians. 
 Recently, Vanuatu was recognized by the Happy 
Planet Index, published by the British-based New 
Economics Foundation, as the happiest place on Earth. 
We are proud to have been placed so high amongst all 
countries of the world, but we have been careful not to 
be carried away, and so often it is that island paradox 
that conceals the diverse development challenges that 
small island countries of the Pacific, such as Vanuatu, 
face in today’s world of globalization. 
 Last week, during the High-Level Meeting on the 
Midterm Comprehensive Global Review of the 
Implementation of the Programme of Action for the 
Least Developed Countries, I spoke of the many 
challenges facing my country in the implementation of 
the Brussels Programme of Action. Vanuatu has been 
showing positive signs of gradual economic growth. 
However, in the light of our vulnerability to natural 
disasters, exogenous market demand and supply price 
fluctuations and their adverse impacts on the three 
most important sectors contributing to our gross 
domestic product, we consider this an inappropriate 
time to include Vanuatu in the list of countries eligible 
for graduation. 
 Furthermore, while the current methods used to 
measure the three main thresholds for graduation are 
dependent on statistical variables, it is commonly 
understood that statistical data for countries in the 
Pacific — including Vanuatu — contain major 
discrepancies. Therefore, relying solely on such data to 
determine Vanuatu’s achievements in relation to the 
thresholds would yield inaccurate results. 
 Very soon, the General Assembly will be 
considering countries recommended for inclusion in 
the list of countries eligible for graduation. That list 
includes Vanuatu. Our arguments for exclusion from 
the list are well founded and based on practical 
realities. My Government considers as premature the 
recommendation by the Committee for Development 
Policy to include Vanuatu on the list. We therefore call 
upon Members of the United Nations to understand and 
support Vanuatu’s case. 
 As a responsible United Nations Member, 
Vanuatu is also contributing towards international 
peace and security. Vanuatu peacekeepers have 
participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions 
in Bosnia and East Timor, and we currently have 
peacekeepers stationed in the Congo, Haiti, Côte 
d’Ivoire and the Sudan. Vanuatu has also participated 
in regional peacekeeping missions in Bougainville and 
Solomon Islands. Those efforts illustrate Vanuatu’s 
resolve to engage in peacekeeping and peacebuilding 
in both the regional and international contexts. 
 With regard to the question of the environment — 
in particular global warming and climate change — my 
Government strongly aligns itself with other small 
island States in urging the international community to 
reduce emissions. The failure of major emitters to sign 
the Kyoto Protocol is a major disappointment. 
 The Charter of the United Nations espouses the 
principles that continue to guide the Organization’s 
efforts in the process of self-determination. It calls for 
recognition of and respect for the fundamental rights of 
peoples and territories still under colonial rule. We 
must not lose sight of that goal. The United Nations 
must make renewed efforts where it has failed to allow 
justice to prevail for those peoples who continue to be 
denied their inalienable right to freedom and 
democracy. We must relegate that dark legacy to the 
past.   
 Determining how to bring more cohesiveness and 
unity to this great community of nations has now 
become a much more formidable challenge. I affirm 
my support for the challenging exercise before us. Our 
Almighty Creator entrusted us, the human race, with 
the safeguarding of a great asset, the Earth. It is 
incumbent on us to make the most of that opportunity. 
The world’s destiny is in our hands. In that spirit, I 
extend my congratulations to Montenegro on its 
admission as the 192nd Member of the United Nations. 
 Before closing, I would like to acknowledge the 
support of our development partners — in particular 
Australia, New Zealand, France, Japan, the People’s 
Republic of China, the United States of America and 
the European Union — as well as the various United 
Nations bodies that are strongly supporting the 
development of Vanuatu. I also extend our appreciation 
to India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia 
for their continuous support within the framework of 
South-South cooperation. In addition, my Government 
is encouraged by the initiative and the kind gesture of 
Venezuela in committing $2 million to the Pacific 
  
 
06-53615 4 
 
islands through the work programme of the United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Those 
are positive developments that together are 
complementing the leadership role being played by my 
Government in its development path. 
 In closing, I take this final opportunity to pay our 
respects to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for 
his outstanding stewardship of the United Nations. His 
wisdom has ensured that the United Nations will retain 
its credibility and its relevance. During periods of 
turbulence and uncertainty, he has been relentless in 
the pursuit of his belief in United Nations reform. My 
Government salutes him for his distinguished service 
to the United Nations. We wish him all the best in his 
future endeavours. "
7020,61,2006,MHL,"I wish to join 
others in congratulating you, Madam, on your election 
as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first 
session. Please be assured of my country’s support and 
cooperation throughout your tenure. 
 The Marshall Islands commends all members of 
the General Assembly for their efforts, contributions 
and cooperation throughout the sixtieth session aimed 
at achieving many of our common aspirations. 
Although we have achieved a good measure of success, 
there is still much work ahead. We must work together 
and pool our resources, our talents and our skills for 
the betterment of all the citizens of the world. It is in 
this regard that I urge the wealthier and more 
developed Member States to increase their generosity 
  
 
06-53952 18 
 
with official development assistance so as to address 
issues of human misery. 
 As one of the smallest States Members of the 
United Nations, the Marshall Islands hopes that the 
sixty-first session of the General Assembly will do 
more to protect and secure our people from threats to 
their livelihood and existence. 
 The Marshall Islands is committed to various 
international and regional plans and agreements, 
including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
the Mauritius Strategy for the further Implementation 
of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable 
Development of Small Island Developing States, the 
Pacific Plan and, more recently, the Micronesian 
Challenge initiative, which sets ambitious targets for 
marine and terrestrial conservation areas throughout 
the Micronesian region. 
 We emphasize the need for the full and effective 
implementation of the commitments, programmes and 
targets adopted, particularly those of the International 
Meeting to Review the Implementation of the 
Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development 
of Small Island Developing States, and for the 
mobilization of the necessary resources from all 
sources for the effective implementation of the 
Mauritius Strategy. 
 Given that the livelihood of our people depends 
heavily on the oceans, we again join our Pacific 
neighbours in requesting that our ocean resources be 
managed and protected from exploitation. Because our 
nation’s single most important productive sector is 
fisheries, which provide us with our key export, the 
state of the world’s oceans and fish stocks and the way 
in which those vital resources are being exploited 
remain concerns of the utmost importance. 
 As a party to the 1982 United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 United 
Nations Fish Stocks Agreement, we recognize the 
importance of the entry into force of the Convention on 
the Conservation and Management of Highly 
Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central 
Pacific Ocean and the subsequent conservation and 
management measures adopted thus far by the recently 
established Western and Central Pacific Fisheries 
Commission. 
 While we acknowledge the implications and 
adverse impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated 
fishing in the region, including the consequences of 
over-fishing for national and regional resources, we are 
continuing to develop and explore ways and means of 
conducting and enforcing conservation and 
management measures, as well as of developing our 
domestic fisheries. We seek a moratorium on bottom 
trawling until there are clear indications that it has no 
effects on ocean biodiversity. 
 It is our hope that regional efforts — such as 
those being undertaken by the small islands developing 
States — to spread the knowledge of conservation and 
the sustainable use of biodiversity will be strengthened 
and enhanced by international assistance. 
 At the national level, I wish to share with 
Member States the progress that we have made in 
terms of Government leadership and national 
development. Our national and local government 
leaders met early last month to review our progress in 
achieving our long term National Development Plan. 
This provided a chance for both the national 
Government and local governments to renew their 
commitments to work together to bring about a better 
Marshall Islands. It also paved the way for 
Government officials to discuss issues of critical 
concern that continue to obstruct our development 
opportunities in the areas of education, health and the 
environment, among others. 
 Another important issue also being discussed on 
the home front is that of the nuclear-weapons tests that 
were conducted in the Marshall Islands. Our people 
have made a disproportionate sacrifices in helping the 
world understand the power of the nuclear bomb. We 
have paid with our own lives, our health and the well-
being of our land and waters, which are so sacred to us. 
Since the Marshall Islands became independent, in 
1986, we have undertaken efforts to better understand 
the impact of the activities that took place on our 
islands during the cold war. We are finding that the 
effects of the 67 atmospheric weapon tests conducted 
in our country were much worse and much more 
widespread than previously understood, although we 
still have a great deal more to learn. 
 As a small country with limited resources, we are 
of course focusing our efforts on addressing the 
nuclear legacy. We call on the United Nations and its 
agencies and on Member States that share similar 
experiences and have expertise in the restoration of 
environments contaminated with radiation and in 
 
 
19 06-53952 
 
addressing health needs linked to radiation exposure to 
assist and support the Marshall Islands Changed 
Circumstances Petition, which was submitted to the 
United States Congress in 2000. As knowledgeable and 
responsible leaders of the world community, the United 
Nations has the capacity to positively influence the 
well-being of the citizens of the Marshall Islands, who 
were under the care of the Trusteeship Council when 
the United States nuclear testing programme was in 
progress — from 1946 to 1958 following the Second 
World War. 
 Marshall Islands reiterates its firm commitment 
to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons (NPT) and its objectives of preventing the 
spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, 
fostering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and 
furthering the goal of achieving general and complete 
disarmament. We urge those countries that have not 
already done so to become a party to the NPT, and 
those countries that are party to the NPT to fully 
cooperate with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and fulfil their obligations under the Treaty. 
 Marshall Islands and French Polynesia know all 
too well that colonial Powers are willing to use 
territories other than their own to conduct dangerous 
nuclear weapons testing. In that regard, we call on the 
United Nations to continue to press for the 
decolonization of all nations in the Pacific region. 
 We also call on the United Nations to admit the 
23 million citizens of Taiwan to the United Nations 
family. Taiwan, which shares the Organization’s view 
on the principles of universality and self-
determination, has been enjoying a democratic 
Government of its own for over half a century. The fact 
that Taiwan has been denied membership into the 
United Nations again and again questions the 
legitimacy of the Organization. On behalf of my 
country, I therefore urge this body to welcome Taiwan 
into its membership.  
 Marshall Islands wishes to reiterate its support 
for the reform, restructuring and expansion of the 
Security Council. In particular, we emphasize the 
inclusion of Japan as a permanent member of the 
Council, and fully endorse Japan’s proposal on the 
methodology to be used in the preparation of the 
United Nations scale of assessments for the period 
2007 to 2009. We are convinced that the entire 
membership of the United Nations would benefit 
greatly from Japan’s permanent membership and its 
proposed scale of assessments structure. 
 In the regional arena, last year Marshall Islands 
joined two of its neighbours in requesting that the 
United Nations step up its presence in the northern 
Pacific to pursue various development agendas, not 
only in our country but also in the Pacific region as a 
whole. I am pleased to inform the Assembly today that 
three United Nations agencies — the United Nations 
Development Programme, the United Nations 
Population Fund and UNICEF — have agreed to 
establish offices in various countries in the region, 
including the Marshall Islands. 
 Moreover, our Government has been working 
extensively with others in the region to implement the 
Pacific Plan, endorsed at the Pacific Islands Forum 
leaders’ meeting held in Papua New Guinea in October 
2005. I wish to join my colleagues in thanking our 
development partners for their assistance in making the 
Plan viable. Marshall Islands remains confident that 
the Pacific Plan will provide a useful framework for 
continued regional and international cooperation. 
 Internationally, the Marshall Islands joins other 
Pacific countries in reiterating our interests and asking 
the international community to recognize the 
vulnerability of small island developing States. They 
need the continued support of developed countries to 
build up their capacity to manage vulnerability, 
strengthen food security and build resilience to 
economic, social and environmental change. We appeal 
to the international community to support and enhance 
existing and new capacity-building efforts of, and 
among, small island developing States. We need the 
assistance of the international community to establish 
mechanisms to enable small island developing States to 
cope with, and adjust to, globalization and trade 
liberalization. 
 Marshall Islands consists predominantly of low-
lying atolls that are an average of two metres above sea 
level. Our small atolls and islands are dwarfed by our 
surrounding exclusive economic zone, which consists 
of approximately 2 million square kilometres of ocean. 
While we rely on our ocean as a means of sustenance 
and survival, the sea becomes our biggest concern 
during increasingly severe weather conditions. We are 
fearful of sea-level rise, which is threatening the very 
existence of our islands. 
  
 
06-53952 20 
 
 We therefore wish to reaffirm our grave concern 
regarding the vulnerability of small island developing 
States to the impacts of climate change, as well as the 
need for urgent action at the international level by the 
major emitters of carbon dioxide among developed and 
developing industrial countries to halt and reverse 
those devastating climate change impacts. 
 I wish to take this opportunity to thank President 
Jan Eliasson for his excellent management of the 
General Assembly presidency over the past year. I also 
wish to congratulate him on his appointment as his 
country’s Minister for Foreign Affairs. The General 
Assembly accomplished a great deal under his able 
leadership and I would like to commend him on his 
achievements. I wish him well in his new post. 
 The people of the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands join me in wishing Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan and Mrs. Nane Annan well in their future 
endeavours. I wish to convey our sincere appreciation 
for their gesture of friendship and goodwill during his 
tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
 In closing, I would like to assure the Assembly 
that my country will continue to work with the United 
Nations to meet our common challenges. Sixty-one 
years on, General Assembly members must move 
deliberately and decisively to overcome the dangers 
that lie ahead. We must meet our responsibilities to our 
respective countries and to each other as members of 
the General Assembly to ensure that we arrive at a 
better future. "
7032,61,2006,NZL,"New Zealand remains 
unwavering in its support for the United Nations. Our 
commitment has not changed since we helped found 
the Organization 61 years ago. This year’s events have 
only reinforced our belief that the world would be 
substantially worse off without the United Nations. 
 It would be remiss of me at this time not to pay 
tribute to Kofi Annan. It is to his vision, determination 
and courage that we must attribute many of the reforms 
achieved thus far. Five years ago, when he was 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Nobel Committee 
paid tribute to his efforts on reform. Since then he has 
continued to work tirelessly for a United Nations that 
can live up to the hopes that “we the peoples” have 
invested in it. This is all the more remarkable given 
that, for much of his stewardship, the United Nations 
has been confronted with some of the most difficult 
international crises of its existence.  
 New Zealand is committed to multilateralism. 
This is not some act of faith, but a commitment to a 
multilateralism that really delivers. We need to be 
prepared to work diligently for the good of the global 
community. 
 The United Nations is passing through a period of 
challenge to its relevance and effectiveness. It has 
 
 
19 06-53323 
 
confronted serious political and security shocks — 
fresh hostilities in the Middle East, the tragic and 
worsening situation in Darfur, and, in our own region, 
instability in Timor-Leste. 
 Last year, world leaders agreed to an ambitious 
reform agenda based on the three pillars of peace and 
security, development and human rights. Progress has 
been made, but this is no time to rest. We must press 
on, for much remains to be done. 
 The challenge of development has never been 
higher on the international agenda. Never before has 
the commitment to eradicating poverty been so critical. 
But increasing aid levels will not be enough; we must 
become more effective. We need to make sure that 
every dollar we spend makes a positive difference. 
That means addressing the key threats to our 
success — poor governance, corruption and gender 
inequality. We need to secure fairer international 
trading relationships, and we must work on all of those 
together. 
 The theme of this year’s general debate is the 
implementation of a global partnership for 
development. For New Zealand, collective action is 
imperative. We need participation, ownership and 
responsibility from recipient countries. We seek 
harmonization with larger contributors to align and 
combine our contributions. We seek partnership with 
multilateral development agencies in our campaign to 
eradicate poverty, and we endorse the efforts of the 
United Nations and those agencies to coordinate better, 
country by country. 
 New Zealand, as members are aware, has a 
relationship with the Pacific that is based on history, 
culture and economic and social linkages. Our bonds 
with Pacific States are an important dimension of our 
other relationships. We want nothing less than 
educated, healthy, well-governed, economically 
prosperous and safe communities. 
 In the Auckland Declaration of 2004, Pacific 
leaders committed themselves to a “region that is 
respected for the quality of its governance, the 
sustainable management of its resources, the full 
observance of democratic values and for its defence 
and promotion of human rights”. These are ambitious 
goals, and translating them into reality means hard 
work by all Pacific countries. That is a challenge that 
New Zealand accepts. 
 In facing that challenge, we confront economic, 
environmental, governance, development and security 
issues. Markets are distant. Climate change is a reality. 
Political instability does not help. Threats from 
communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and 
pandemic influenza must be managed. 
 The Pacific accounts for almost one quarter of the 
surface of the world — an area bigger than Europe and 
the Middle East combined. Its strategic significance 
presents opportunity and challenge. New Zealand is 
determined to seek out the benefits of that significance 
and guard against the threats, among which I include, 
sadly, cheque-book diplomacy. 
 Across the Pacific, we have learned that regional 
problems require regional solutions. Last year, Pacific 
Island Forum leaders adopted the Pacific Plan for 
regional cooperation. Through that plan we will 
strengthen regional cooperation where it can most 
make a difference, and we will use it to promote the 
four goals of the Pacific Islands Forum: sustainable 
development, economic growth, security and good 
governance. 
 At the same time, we do not forget that our 
regional endeavours depend on strong international 
frameworks. The Framework Convention on Climate 
Change is an essential example. Another example is the 
United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement on the 
conservation and management of straddling and highly 
migratory fish stocks. 
 We are proud of our achievements in regional 
fisheries management. The Western and Central Pacific 
Fisheries Commission, with its headquarters in 
Pohnpei, manages the region’s migratory fish species. 
We are in the midst of developing new regional 
arrangements for non-migratory fish stocks. 
 These mechanisms are central to the region’s 
ability to ensure the sustainable management of its 
most important natural resources. They are at the 
leading edge in establishing best-practice management 
norms. 
 There have been profound political and security 
shocks over the past year — in the Middle East and in 
Darfur, as well as instability in Timor-Leste — those 
and more are testing the United Nations system. 
 It is a sad reality that the situation in the Middle 
East has been on the agenda of the United Nations for 
60 years, ever since its inception. The lack of sustained 
  
 
06-53323 20 
 
political will to see through more than a handful of 
decisions on the Middle East has undermined 
confidence. It has contributed to an unstable 
environment where extremism, injustice and despair 
flourish. 
 These issues must be tackled with a new resolve, 
using the international multilateral system as a tool for 
peace and progress. The international response to the 
Security Council’s call for an expanded United Nations 
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) shows that the 
international community can react to conflict and 
provide basic stabilization. But such responses are 
doomed to failure unless the underlying political and 
security issues are addressed. It is therefore imperative 
to relaunch the Middle East peace process covering all 
issues, on the basis of the relevant Security Council 
resolutions. 
 The Organization’s efforts to introduce a United 
Nations force into Darfur is being cynically thwarted 
by the Government of the Sudan. That is simply 
unconscionable. The Government of the Sudan must, in 
the name of basic humanity, accept the need for a 
United Nations force as the best chance for the security 
of the people of Darfur. 
 New and fragile States face enormous challenges. 
Recent unrest in Timor-Leste demonstrates that fact. 
New Zealand responded quickly to Timor-Leste’s 
needs with a military and police contribution to help 
restore stability. The regional response has been swift 
and robust. The United Nations played an important 
role in facilitating Timor-Leste’s independence, and it 
is clear the United Nations will continue to be involved 
in Timor-Leste for many years to come. The 
deployment of a substantial United Nations police 
force is vital if peace and stability is to be maintained 
even in the medium term. The nature of the expanded 
United Nations mission in Timor-Leste reflects the 
deep and broad engagement required to build a lasting 
peace. Timor-Leste encapsulates the principle that 
peace and security cannot be separated from economic 
development, social reconciliation and the protection 
of basic human rights. The Security Council’s mandate 
for Timor-Leste endorses that truth. 
 New Zealand fully supported the renewed focus 
on human rights at last year’s World Summit. We 
strongly campaigned for the new Human Rights 
Council, and we worked hard to bring it into being. We 
have high ambitions for it and will follow its activities 
closely. It must remain strong, focused and effective. It 
must be able to deal swiftly with emerging situations of 
human rights concern, in a balanced way, with 
scrupulous attention to verifiable facts. It must be 
aspirational, inspirational and practical. Its working 
methods must be transparent and inclusive. Above all, 
there must be genuine political will to make it work. 
 A few weeks ago, encouraged all the way by 
energetic non-governmental organizations, Member 
States agreed on the first new comprehensive human 
rights instrument of the twenty-first century: a draft 
convention relating to persons with disabilities. We are 
proud in New Zealand of the role we played in those 
negotiations on the text. The draft convention stands to 
make a real difference to the lives of approximately 
650 million of the world’s most disadvantaged citizens. 
 New Zealand is also conscious of the 
disadvantages faced by indigenous peoples in many 
parts of the world. We were closely engaged in the 
lengthy negotiations towards a declaration on the rights 
of indigenous peoples. We had hoped that the 
declaration would be a new standard of achievement 
for Governments that could be implemented to really 
improve the lives of indigenous peoples. Therefore, we 
are disappointed that that was not to be so. The draft 
declaration that emerged with less than conclusive 
support from the Human Rights Council is deeply 
flawed and represents a lost opportunity for the world’s 
indigenous peoples. 
 At the beginning of his term, the Secretary-
General set an important goal for the United Nations: 
to perfect “the triangle of development, freedom and 
peace” (A/51/PV.88, p. 13). The Secretary-General’s 
words still ring true today. We have travelled only part 
of the journey towards that goal. Considering our 
achievements over the past year, we can be satisfied 
with progress made in setting up the Human Rights 
Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. The 
challenge now is to make those two new bodies truly 
effective. The welcome adoption of the United Nations 
Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) 
reminds us of the efforts we must continue to make at 
regional and national levels. 
 New Zealand wants to see continuing reform high 
on the list of priorities for the sixty-first session in 
order to ensure that the United Nations can be as 
responsive as possible to the needs of Member States, 
 
 
21 06-53323 
 
and efficient in getting the best from the resources 
available to it. 
 Sixty years ago, New Zealand had high hopes for 
the United Nations. In 2006, we still do. New Zealand 
is a country that engages with the United Nations with 
no hidden agenda. What we say is what we mean. We 
engage with no other or hidden agenda. But those that 
do so pervert and weaken this Organization.  
 In 2006, at this meeting, New Zealand declares 
that we will continue to put our efforts behind the 
principles and policies that will make the United 
Nations strong. "
7082,61,2006,PLW,"Let me begin by offering my 
congratulations to you, Madam President. We would 
also like to thank former Assembly President Jan 
Eliasson for his able leadership over the past year. Our  
 
deep appreciation also goes to Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan, who has served the Organization with skill and 
devotion. 
 Palau joins others in welcoming Montenegro, the 
newest State Member of the United Nations. We look 
forward to its participation in our debates.  
 Participation in the United Nations has special 
meaning for Palau. We were the last country to emerge 
from the United Nations Trusteeship System. During 
trusteeship, it was the United Nations that showed us 
that every country, regardless of size, had a role to 
play. The United Nations provided our nation with a 
platform from which we could achieve independence 
and establish our sovereignty. For that we are forever 
grateful. 
 Palau is often seen as a paradise of swaying palm 
trees and ocean breezes. But that simplistic view fails 
to recognize the challenges we face as a small island 
developing State. In this shrinking world, the actions of 
distant countries are having a profound effect on us. 
We come to the Assembly now, asking for its help once 
again as we face those difficult issues. 
 One of the issues that we hope the General 
Assembly will act on this year is deep-sea bottom 
trawling. As the Secretary-General has reported, 
bottom trawling is responsible for 95 per cent of the 
worldwide damage to seamount ecosystems. It is an 
irresponsible practice, and Palau has passed a law 
banning all bottom trawling within our waters. In doing 
so, Palau followed the lead set by Japan, the United 
States, Norway, Australia and many other responsible 
countries. 
 It is now time to ensure that similar measures are 
taken for international waters. That is why Palau has 
joined with our Pacific colleagues in Tuvalu, the 
Marshall Islands and Micronesia to propose an interim 
prohibition on unregulated bottom trawling. Our 
proposal represents the strong determination of our 
region to protect the oceans upon which we all 
ultimately rely. 
 Another issue of great importance is that of 
global warming. Coral bleaching, a rise in sea level and 
altered fish migration all threaten the future of Palau 
and other small island nations. Reversing that trend is 
one of our top priorities. We continue to urge the 
international community to act aggressively to reduce 
emissions that lead to global warming. 
  
 
06-53317 18 
 
 Palau is a democratic society. Our children know 
the importance of culture and community. We 
guarantee human rights in our nation. We also know 
that flying our flag here at the United Nations carries 
with it certain obligations, and we have met them all. 
Palau has deployed peacekeepers to regional and 
international missions. When natural disasters strike, 
Palau responds willingly and voluntarily. When the 
international community called upon countries to 
preserve biodiversity, Palau came forward with the 
Micronesian Challenge. That initiative will protect 462 
coral species, which represent 58 per cent of all known 
corals. 
 Our future as a nation and the future of our 
children depend upon the viability of our environment, 
especially of the oceans. Palau relies on the health of 
its amazing reefs and waters to provide food for our 
people and to support our tourism industry. Without 
those we will not be able to develop a sustainable 
economy that will allow our children to live and work 
in their homeland. To provide for them, we look to the 
United Nations for leadership and support. To that end, 
Palau remains open to ideas for harmonizing the 
environmental agencies at the United Nations. We 
applaud efforts to streamline the process of accessing 
those agencies; that would make them more responsive 
to small nations. In the same vein, Palau would like to 
state that difficulties in accessing assistance in 
claiming our extended continental shelf have made it 
clear that we will have a hard time meeting the 2009 
deadline for submissions. 
 Last year, in this historic Hall, we noted our 
concern that the United Nations, its offices and 
organizations did not have a permanent representative 
in Palau. In June, it was announced that a coalition 
comprised of the United Nations Development 
Programme, UNICEF and the United Nations 
Population Fund would open a total of eight new 
offices in Pacific island countries, including Palau. We 
welcome that historic accomplishment. It is a giant step 
towards harmonization within the United Nations. For 
Palau, it will give us one of the tools we need most for 
sustainable development, namely, local capacity-
building. 
 Let us not forget the continuing threat of 
terrorism. We recognize that terrorism anywhere is a 
threat to people everywhere. We have looked for 
assistance to improve our anti-terrorism capacity. Palau 
has met, and worked with, the Counter-terrorism 
Executive Directorate to advance our requests for 
assistance, particularly in the area of combating 
money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. 
Unfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been 
insufficient. Our hope is that, during the sixty-first 
session of the General Assembly, the United Nations 
will be able to help smaller countries in addressing that 
threat. 
 We would also like to take a moment to thank a 
few of the many partners that have assisted Palau this 
past year. The efforts of the Global Environment 
Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme deserve 
special recognition. The GEF programme in the North 
Pacific has resulted in an effective mechanism to 
protect our environment through grass-roots projects.  
 Palau has also partnered with a number of 
countries that have supported our development. First, 
the United States has provided in-country diplomatic 
representation and years of support. We acknowledge 
the generosity of the United States in responding to 
natural disasters in Asia and the Pacific region. We 
thank them for that. Japan has also provided invaluable 
assistance to Palau. The addition of Japan as a member 
of the Security Council would help inform other 
Council members that are less familiar with our 
regional needs and concerns. We have supported, and 
continue to support, the G-4 draft resolution, and hope 
that the Assembly will address the draft resolution this 
year. 
 Taiwan has been another steady supporter of 
Palau’s development. We continue to assert that the 
world would benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the 
United Nations and other international institutions. 
This year, Palau co-sponsored a draft resolution calling 
for a proactive role for the United Nations in 
addressing the tensions in East Asia. We were 
disappointed that the actions of the General Committee 
prevented a debate on that draft resolution. 
 Palau would also like to recognize Australia’s 
steadfast commitment to stability in our region, as well 
as its dedication to capacity-building. Through such 
initiatives as its patrol boat programme, Australia 
enables Palau to address illegal, unregulated and 
unreported fishing, which threatens our sovereignty 
and the marine habitats that surround our island nation. 
 We call on all parties in the Sudan to work 
together to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. 
As Mr. Jan Eliasson stated on 11 September,  
 
 
19 06-53317 
 
 “we have ... seen the horrors of Cambodia, 
Rwanda and Srebrenica without taking action. 
The same tragedy must not befall the people in 
Darfur or elsewhere. The responsibility to protect 
must move from declaration to action.” 
(A/60/PV.100, p. 6 ) 
 Lastly, Palau would like to take this opportunity 
to express our hope that the Middle East peace process 
can be successfully restarted. We are hopeful that the 
expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 
(UNIFIL) will bring peace and security to both Israel 
and Lebanon. We stress the need for full 
implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 
(2006), including its preamble. We join the call for the 
unconditional release of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers. 
It is critical that the reconstructed UNIFIL force be 
effective and capable of enforcing the arms embargo as 
called for. 
 On behalf of Palau, a small island nation in the 
wide Pacific Ocean, let me thank the entire Assembly 
in my country’s native language. Kom Kmal Mesulang. 
God bless you all. "
7092,61,2006,PNG,"I 
wish to convey Papua New Guinea’s congratulations to 
you, Madam President, on your election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first 
session. I assure you of my country’s full cooperation 
during your presidency. We compliment your 
predecessor, Mr. Jan Eliasson, for his stewardship of 
our work during his tenure. We also congratulate him 
on his appointment as Sweden’s Foreign Minister and 
wish him well. 
 On 10 October 1975, 24 days after Papua New 
Guinea attained political independence, I stood at this 
very rostrum and addressed the Assembly with a lot of 
hope and expectations. Like many developing countries 
coming out from the colonial yoke, Papua New Guinea 
committed itself to the principles and purposes of the 
United Nations. I said: “I state our fundamental 
commitment to the maintenance of peace throughout 
our world and our undertaking to uphold the principles 
of the Charter of the United Nations Organization.” 
 We believed that the United Nations was the most 
appropriate body to achieve our aspirations of 
meaningful economic development, respect for our 
sovereignty and the attainment of a peaceful and secure 
world. The harsh reality today is that these aspirations 
remain largely unfulfilled for many of us. Our record 
will indicate lost opportunities to realize the promise of 
a better world. 
 Our world today is marked by an inequitable 
global trading order and a hostile security environment. 
Wanton globalization and unfettered trade 
liberalization are affecting many of us in ways that are 
detrimental to the livelihood of our people. Unilateral 
actions by the big and powerful to resolve disputes are 
no longer incidental, but are the order of the day. We 
note the increasing incidence of human atrocities, 
genocides, wars, poverty, terrorism, the emergence of 
HIV/AIDS, and an increase in malaria and 
tuberculosis. Our streets and communities are littered 
with small arms and light weapons. The smuggling of 
drugs and humans and other illegal activities are on the 
rise. Environmental degradation and climate change 
continue unabated. We must confront these issues 
urgently. To complement efforts in other forums, Papua 
New Guinea, with other countries of the Pacific region, 
has agreed to pool its limited resources under the 
Pacific plan to address these issues. 
 Papua New Guinea continues to believe that the 
United Nations offers the best hope for its Member 
States to address these ongoing concerns and other 
emerging challenges facing humanity today. In this 
regard, my country supports the ongoing United 
Nations reform initiatives that seek to make its 
 
 
21 06-52879 
 
operations more effective and responsive. We must 
ensure that its collective security mandates and 
functions, and its various organizations, are 
strengthened and not weakened. We are pleased to note 
the establishment of the Human Rights Council and 
Peacebuilding Commission. Papua New Guinea 
believes in a revitalized General Assembly whose role 
and authority reflect its broad membership. We must 
press on with the reform of the Security Council with 
courage and boldness so that it reflects the political and 
economic realities of today. An expanded Security 
Council must be more democratic and transparent. Its 
membership must include developing countries, while 
maintaining geographic balance and representation. 
 Global trade today is characterized more by the 
unfair practices of those already holding decided 
advantages than by the opportunities it offers to 
developing countries such as Papua New Guinea. Our 
efforts to develop a more equitable trading order are 
hampered by the reluctance of our developed partners 
to open their economies and engage in genuine 
development discussions. Adding insult to injury, many 
of our developed partners have yet to meet the targets 
they agreed with respect to Official Development 
Assistance. 
 While we appreciate the efforts of some of our 
developed partners to ease the burden of debt under the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, we are 
disappointed that many of them have not shown the 
same leadership on the Doha Development Round, 
leading to its collapse. We are calling for developing 
countries to join us in framing a new and true 
development round. We must exercise leadership rather 
than passively allowing others to chart our future. 
 Despite these difficulties, Papua New Guinea is 
pursuing economic development programmes that are 
based on an export-driven economic growth strategy. 
At the heart of this policy objective is the focus on 
rural development. We have developed a five-year 
medium-term development strategy and aligned it with 
the Millennium Development Goals. Achieving those 
goals by 2015 is a tremendous challenge for Papua 
New Guinea but we have taken the first step in 
providing budget funding for its implementation. We 
call for the support of the United Nations system and 
other genuine development partners to meet these vital 
commitments. 
 As a result of better policy coordination, stricter 
implementation of structural reform and prudent 
financial and economic management, Papua New 
Guinea has attained macroeconomic and fiscal 
stability. Our economy is growing, interest rates have 
fallen, and the exchange rate has been stabilized. Our 
foreign exchange reserves are at an all-time high. We 
are using these gains to reinvest in productive sectors 
of our economy and in delivering services to our 
people. Development partners must play a supportive 
role to sustain these gains. This can be done through 
fair trade opportunities, equitable markets, increased 
foreign investment, transfer of technology, capacity-
building and providing quality overseas development 
assistance. 
 I now turn to an issue about which my country 
feels strongly, that of climate change and sea-level rise. 
For us this is not academic, it is reality. Small islands 
and low-lying atolls in Papua New Guinea and the 
Pacific region are being submerged by rising sea 
levels. As I speak, my own people are being resettled 
to higher ground. Papua New Guinea’s strong position 
on the environment is drawn from the preamble to our 
national Constitution, which states: 
 “We declare our fourth goal to be for Papua New 
Guinea’s natural resources and environment to be 
conserved and used for the collective benefit of 
us all, and be replenished for the benefit of future 
generations.” 
That constitutional imperative underpins my country’s 
whole approach to sustainable development objectives, 
including those contained in the Johannesburg Plan of 
Implementation and the Mauritius Strategy. 
 Environmental degradation is occurring at a 
frightening pace. Scientific studies suggest that climate 
change is causing increasing incidences of 
environmental catastrophes such as hurricanes, 
tsunamis, landslides and flash floods. Our planet is in 
distress. As co-inhabitants of this world we must all 
equally share responsibility to address the root causes 
of this problem. We urge industrialized countries to 
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We call upon 
those that have not yet done so to accede to and ratify 
the Kyoto Protocol. 
 Papua New Guinea is prepared to play its part to 
protect and conserve the world’s tropical rainforest 
with the aim of stabilizing the earth’s climate. The 
findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
  
 
06-52879 22 
 
Change suggest that an estimated 20 per cent to 25 per 
cent of annual global emissions were generated 
through land-use change, primarily from the 
degradation of forest resources. In this context it is 
crucial for us to protect the tropical rainforests through 
sustainable and fair market-based incentives. 
 The dilemma is that for some of us the forestry 
sector is a major revenue earner, a provider of much-
needed employment, a facilitator of important 
infrastructure projects, and a catalyst for the provision 
of basic services in rural areas. The present incentives 
offered by international markets for agriculture, 
forestry and emissions reductions are inadequate. 
These are perverse incentives from the standpoint of 
the environment. Papua New Guinea, along with Costa 
Rica, has formed a new Coalition for Rainforest 
Nations that includes many other countries in Africa, 
Asia, Latin America and the Pacific. Together we are 
pursuing an initiative to access global carbon markets 
and to support efforts to reduce rates of deforestation. 
Simply put, this approach seeks to recognize the 
contribution of resource owners to conserving and 
protecting rainforests for the benefit of mankind. We 
invite more nations to join our efforts to create new 
markets and reform outmoded market and regulatory 
mechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contribute 
more effectively towards environmental sustainability, 
economic development, climate stability and poverty 
reduction. 
 The initiative on deforestation is part of a broader 
agenda being pursued by my Government to implement 
the Millennium Development Goal to ensure 
environmental sustainability. We are convinced that by 
implementing the seventh goal we will harness our 
ability to achieve environmentally and socially 
sustainable economic growth. Many times developing 
countries are drawn into false promises of international 
investment. Often we find our natural resources 
exploited, leaving us with neither the resource nor the 
money. We will not allow this to continue. We want 
wealth from our natural resources to remain within our 
nations to fuel our economic growth. 
 The threat of HIV/AIDS is real in many of our 
countries and has serious implications for social and 
economic development. In Papua New Guinea my 
Government has passed HIV/AIDS legislation, 
underpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy 
framework. To ensure close scrutiny I have vested my 
department with the responsibility of overseeing 
implementation. In addition, I have appointed a special 
minister to assist me in providing political leadership 
on this particular issue. But our experience suggests 
that national action alone is not enough. It requires a 
concerted global response. This is a war that must be 
waged on all fronts and by all countries. We thank the 
United Nations and its related agencies for their efforts 
to address this issue. We also applaud the bold 
leadership of former United States President Mr. Bill 
Clinton and of Mr. Bill Gates in this regard. 
 Of equal importance are the battles against 
malaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. 
While we, as a global community, have focused on 
HIV/AIDS and bird flu, this has diluted our attention to 
malaria, which remains the biggest killer disease in my 
country. I call upon our development partners to 
support Papua New Guinea and other countries in 
maintaining perspective on these challenges. 
 Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is a 
serious threat to international peace and security. It 
must be condemned irrespective of who perpetrates it. 
All countries and peoples of the world have a serious 
responsibility to stand united and fight this evil. 
However, Papua New Guinea is concerned about the 
erosion of the international community’s moral 
authority to address this issue. It is unhelpful to our 
credibility if certain of our members choose to address 
this issue in flagrant violation of international norms 
and universally agreed conventions. As with other 
cross-border challenges, Member States will require 
the support of the United Nations and development 
partners with capacity-building and other necessary 
resources to effectively fight global terrorism. 
 The conflict in the Middle East, despite various 
United Nations resolutions, remains unresolved. Papua 
New Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict, 
including those Powers with the capacity to influence a 
positive outcome, to make the hard concessions 
necessary for a peaceful resolution of this long-
standing issue. The recent confrontation in Lebanon 
resulted in the loss of innocent lives and massive 
destruction to infrastructure. Papua New Guinea 
appeals for restraint by all parties and urges that full 
use be made of the dispute settlement procedures of the 
United Nations. Comprehensive and lasting solutions 
must be found to the issues that led to the conflict. 
Neighbouring countries and the international 
community as a whole can make positive contributions 
by shepherding a process that allows for genuine 
 
 
23 06-52879 
 
dialogue to take place. We commend the United 
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and 
European countries such as France, Italy and Germany 
and others that are contributing troops to maintain the 
ceasefire. 
 Papua New Guinea is extremely concerned about 
the proliferation among States of nuclear, chemical, 
biological and other weapons of mass destruction. We 
continue to maintain that there is no real justification 
for the retention and further development of these 
instruments of war. We call upon all countries to ratify 
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and other 
related treaties to reduce the threat to international 
peace and security by weapons of mass destruction. 
Sadly, we were reminded by the Secretary-General 
yesterday of the apathy that surrounds actions on non-
proliferation and disarmament. 
 The work of the United Nations Special 
Committee on Decolonization remains unfinished. We 
still have 16 non-self-governing territories, some in the 
Pacific, that are yet to exercise their right to self-
determination. The referendum in Tokelau 
demonstrated a true spirit of cooperation between 
Tokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate both 
Governments and assure the people of Tokelau of our 
respect for their decision to remain in free association 
with New Zealand. 
 I conclude by saying that the world has changed 
in ways that not only provide opportunities, but also 
offer more complex challenges for Members of the 
United Nations. The emergence of a trend over the 
years to try to resolve these challenges outside the 
principles and framework prescribed by the United 
Nations has resulted in a world worse than the founders 
of the Organization envisaged. We must renew our 
commitment and faith in the United Nations and seek 
to reform it in ways that reflect the realities of today. 
 At this juncture I take the opportunity to pay a 
special tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General, 
Mr. Kofi Annan, for his outstanding contribution to the 
United Nations and the world. We wish him well. As 
this is likely to be the last General Assembly session in 
which I take part, I take this opportunity to thank all 
those who have contributed in one way or another in 
support of Papua New Guinea since independence. 
When I brought my nation to take its seat in this 
Assembly 31 years ago I said, and I reaffirm today, that 
within the limits of our resources Papua New Guinea 
will play an active and positive role in the United 
Nations. "
7107,61,2006,KIR,"I bring to you all warm 
greetings from the President, Government and people 
of the Republic of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am 
honoured and privileged to address this Assembly this 
evening. 
 Allow me, Sir, to offer my heartiest 
congratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election to the 
presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first 
session. I am confident that under her able stewardship 
this session will successfully deliver constructive and 
productive outcomes that will benefit the membership. 
I wish also to offer my congratulations to her 
predecessor for his successful guidance of the work of 
the Assembly during the past year. 
 May I also express to the Secretary-General, 
Mr. Kofi Annan, my warmest congratulations on his 
sterling leadership of the Organization during his 
tenure in office. We are grateful for the excellent work 
he has done in navigating the Organization through the 
challenges of the past decade. We wish him well in his 
future endeavours. 
 We continue to be confronted with major 
challenges. Those challenges affect each of us as 
individual countries and as members of the 
international community. Peace and security remain 
elusive in this world of ours, given the ongoing 
conflicts and the threat of new conflicts around the 
world. Terrorism continues to plague us, despite the 
best concerted and collective efforts. Still more needs 
to be done to remove the threat posed by the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And 
while some progress has been made towards addressing 
the threat posed by the continuing illicit trade in small 
arms and light weapons, further work is needed to 
eliminate that threat. 
 For the least developed countries and the small 
island developing States, the challenges of economic 
development remain at the forefront of our agendas. 
Marginalization in the global economy is a feature 
common to many least developed countries and small 
island developing States. The record high price of oil 
has done little to ease the burden on our small 
economies. 
 In Kiribati, our remoteness and insularity, narrow 
economic base, small population size and high 
population growth rates are factors with which we must 
contend. We must also deal with the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic and tuberculosis, among other diseases, 
  
 
06-52737 50 
 
which require the diversion of the already meagre 
resources at our disposal to finance development. 
 With those daunting challenges looming, we are 
forced to operate in an environment of uncertainty. I 
say “uncertainty”, because our very survival as a nation 
and as a people with a distinct culture and way of life 
is being threatened by global warming and sea-level 
rise. 
 These are challenges that we, as individual 
countries and as Members of this collective body, need 
to continue to work together to address. In this 
increasingly interdependent world of ours, ripples 
emanating from one part will ultimately reach out to 
touch the shores of others. 
 Kiribati consists of low-lying coral atolls and is 
particularly vulnerable to the impact of global warming 
and sea-level rise. For countries such as ours, global 
warming and sea-level rise are critical security issues. 
While we welcome the support that has been 
forthcoming in developing adaptation strategies to 
these phenomena, there is a limit to the extent to which 
we can adapt. Rising sea levels will affect our 
groundwater supply and gradually erode whatever land 
is available on our 33 islands. Yes, we could always 
move inland to avoid the rising sea levels. But, given 
the narrowness of our islands, if we move inland too 
far, we risk falling into either the lagoon or the ocean. 
 We will continue to call on the international 
community to agree on a unified global response to 
these phenomena. We will continue to work with like-
minded countries in pushing the case for such a 
response. We have been disappointed at the lack of 
consensus on these critical environmental issues. 
Indeed, we deplore the notion that economic growth 
should take precedence over environmental issues 
when the quest for such growth threatens the very 
survival of some Members of the Organization. 
 Kiribati is a strong supporter of environmental 
conservation efforts. In that regard, we have announced 
the establishment of the Phoenix Islands Protected 
Area, which is recognized as the third largest marine 
protected area in the world. We are pleased to have 
been able to contribute to global environmental 
conservation efforts through the Protected Area. We are 
prepared to work with those willing and able to ensure 
its sustainability. 
 We note the progress that has been made with 
regard to reforming the United Nations. 
Understandably, we would have liked to see greater 
progress made by now, but we fully recognize the need 
for more discussions on the various relevant issues. 
 Indeed, that is multilateralism in practice. The 
debate on unilateralism versus multilateralism in world 
affairs continues unabated. We see multilateralism in 
full play in the debate on United Nations reform. We 
consider that to be a reflection of the healthy interest 
that each Member country has in the Organization. 
Indeed, in this day and age, multilateralism would 
seem to be a more appropriate approach than 
unilateralism. 
 Consensus has yet to be reached on reform of the 
Security Council. We note with interest the report of 
the Working Group. While acknowledging the very 
strong interest in the issues raised and the need to forge 
a consensus, we believe that perhaps there is also a 
need to consider how much more time will be required 
to move this forward. 
 Our position on the issue remains unchanged: 
those Member States that are major contributors to 
United Nations programmes — especially with regard 
to the maintenance of global peace and security — 
should be accorded permanent membership of the 
Security Council. In our view, Japan, as such a 
Member State, qualifies for permanent membership. 
 Regional cooperation in the Pacific has been 
effective. In the recent past, we have had a number of 
examples of success in regional cooperative efforts. 
The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon 
Islands has made substantial contributions to securing 
peace and law and order in that country. Kiribati is 
pleased to have been able to contribute civilian police 
personnel to the Mission. We will continue to support 
its work as long as the people and the Government of 
the Solomon Islands wish it to continue. 
 The Pacific Regional Assistance to Nauru 
programme has made positive contributions to Nauru. 
In view of the historical ties between our two 
countries, we have worked closely with Nauru on a 
bilateral basis and remain committed to considering 
other options through which we can extend our 
collaboration. 
 
 
51 06-52737 
 
 Our leaders will be meeting next month to 
discuss, among other things, progress on the Pacific 
Plan. We are satisfied with the initial progress. The 
success or lack thereof of the Pacific Plan will depend 
on a number of factors, including the political 
commitment of each member country to the Plan and 
the Plan’s ability to deliver tangible benefits over and 
above what is available, on a bilateral basis, to its 
membership. 
 We extend a warm welcome to the Republic of 
Montenegro, which joined the Organization as a 
Member this year. Montenegro’s membership brings to 
192 the total United Nations membership. The 
continuing desire on the part of many to join the 
Organization attests to the value and continued 
relevance of the United Nations. 
 Therefore, I note with much disappointment and 
regret that the desire of the 23 million people of 
Taiwan to join this Organization of ours continues to 
be rejected, despite Taiwan’s demonstrated ability, 
willingness and commitment to contribute to 
international collaborative efforts in the pursuit of 
global peace and security. In recent years, there has 
been much talk of good governance, of democratizing  
 
nations. Should we not also talk about adopting a 
policy of good governance in our multilateral 
organizations? Should we also not talk about 
democratizing our multilateral organizations? We 
deplore the sad state of affairs in which a nation of 23 
million people is deliberately exempt from 
participation as an equal member of the international 
community. 
 The President of the General Assembly has our 
full support as she carries out the duties of her office. 
We commit ourselves to working closely with her as 
we collectively seek to address the challenges facing 
us. 
 Allow me to close by conveying to all members 
of the General Assembly our traditional blessing: to 
mauri, to raoi ao to tabomoa — health, peace and 
prosperity. "
7119,61,2006,NRU,"The Republic of Nauru 
congratulates the President of the General Assembly on 
her election. Nauru commends her pledge to work with 
Member States to achieve the objectives of the United 
Nations Charter with transparency and with respect for 
all views and positions. She has our support and 
cooperation as she leads this Assembly in the days 
ahead. 
 Nauru congratulates the outgoing President, Jan 
Eliasson, on his appointment as Foreign Minister of 
Sweden and commends him for implementing the 
World Summit Outcome Document. His significant 
contribution has been crucial to the United Nations 
reform process. 
 We pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
and thank him for his leadership, courage and vision 
over the past 10 years. 
 While we aim to reform this great Organization, 
in line with the realities of the world, we continue to 
witness major upheavals, conflicts, explosions of 
violence, natural disasters, terrorism and the giants we 
have yet to conquer — that is, poverty, disease and 
human and environmental degradation. We must assure 
the people of the world that we are committed to 
finding lasting solutions to global problems, while 
upholding the principles of the United Nations with 
full respect for human rights. 
 But Nauru is concerned that much has been said, 
but very little has been done. We must, therefore, focus 
on doing more, as opposed to talking more. And, of 
equal importance, we must be seen to be doing more, 
not seen to be talking more. 
 As a small island developing State, Nauru’s 
concerns relate primarily to development. Yet we have 
seen little, if any, action to implement the outcome of 
the Mauritius summit meeting on the sustainable 
development of small island developing States held last 
year. There have been no substantial reductions in 
global emissions since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. The 
Monterrey Consensus, whereby the wealthier countries 
would increase official development assistance to 
0.7 per cent of their gross national product, is still far 
from being translated into reality. 
 Despite private and public pledges by the United 
Nations, we in the Pacific have yet to see the 
establishment of United Nations offices in the smaller 
  
 
06-53317 6 
 
Pacific member countries of the United Nations, such 
as Nauru.  
 Despite this Organization’s pledge for 
universality and the protection of human rights for all, 
we still deny the 23 million people of Taiwan their 
right to peace and to development without threat of 
attack, including through the denial of their right to 
representation at the United Nations. 
 Mr. Romulo (Philippines), Vice-President, took 
the Chair. 
 We support the inclusivity of the United Nations, 
and we reject threats to human dignity, including the 
denial that the Holocaust ever occurred, together with 
any call for the elimination of any responsible Member 
State of this Organization. 
 That is why Nauru will join other Member 
countries in protesting and seeking legal redress to the 
violations of the rules of procedure of the General 
Assembly that occurred during the meeting of the 
General Committee last week. Two questions were to 
be debated: a proactive role for the United Nations in 
maintaining peace and security in East Asia, and the 
question of the representation and participation of the 
23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations. 
 The employment of procedural tricks to deny 
member countries their right to take part in the debate 
calls into question the universality of the United 
Nations, for such tricks only serve to deprive Nauru 
and like-minded countries of their right to be heard. 
Even more important, it underlines the need for reform 
of the United Nations. 
 There must be a greater voice of the many 
peoples of the globe, including those of the developing 
world and those countries that can better represent the 
interests of the developing world. Nauru, therefore, 
echoes the words of the Secretary-General when he 
says: 
  “I believe very strongly in the need for 
Security Council reform, and I have said time and 
time again that no reform of the UN will be 
complete without Security Council reform. ... 
They should pursue Security Council reform 
because it is part of the reason why we have 
tensions in the Organization today. Because quite 
a lot of Members feel that our governance 
structure is anachronistic and we cannot continue 
to have a situation where the power base is 
perceived to be controlled by a limited number of 
five Member States.” 
 We believe we must move quickly to reform the 
Council and also to include Japan, Brazil, India and 
Germany in the permanent membership. 
 We encourage the United Nations, as part of the 
reform package, to consider a more binding framework 
by which the many declarations arising from the 
Organization and its many meetings can be 
implemented and measured. Clearly, our moral 
obligations are not producing the desired results. It is 
time to build a global partnership within a binding 
framework in order to facilitate the implementation of 
resolutions. 
 We believe that each developing country has 
primary responsibility for its own development. The 
year 2005 marked a significant chapter in the 
development of my country when we presented our 
first national development strategy at our first donor 
roundtable meeting. Our national development strategy 
calls for a partnership. It was drafted by community 
leaders, civil society, the private sector and the 
Government of Nauru, based on a national vision. It 
outlines our priorities and the steps required to reach 
those goals within a 20-year framework. We gratefully 
acknowledge our development partners. They have 
given us tangible assistance that has improved our 
lives.  
 However, we still receive offers of development 
assistance that come with unrealistic conditions 
attached. In some cases, such assistance is used as a 
tool of interventionist foreign policy, without giving 
priority to the human aspect of the development 
agenda. 
 For any fragile developing State, delayed 
assistance creates a perception of failure and 
incompetence and leads to political and social 
instability. My delegation is disappointed that the 
intention of the United Nations to expand its presence 
in Nauru and other Pacific countries continues 
unfulfilled. The purpose of an expanded presence 
would be to achieve the MDGs and other development 
objectives. We call on the United Nations to recognize 
our urgent needs and to act with certainty, following a 
realistic timetable. 
 My delegation believes that good governance 
yields good returns for all people. Nauru is emerging 
 
 
7 06-53317 
 
from governance problems caused by shortcomings in 
the Constitution adopted at our independence. We are 
grateful for the assistance from the United Nations 
Democracy Fund that will facilitate the consultative 
process for a review of our Constitution. That process 
is critical to the political stability and accountability of 
future Governments. 
 In the Summit Outcome, we agreed on measures 
aimed at protecting our common environment, 
including a call for a more coherent institutional 
framework to address the environmental challenges of 
today. We encourage revisiting the climate change 
agenda to give more urgency to action as opposed to 
pledges. 
 In this regard, we also welcome the Secretary-
General’s establishment of a High-level Panel on 
United Nations System-wide Coherence. Nauru aligns 
itself with the interventions made by the leaders of 
Pacific nations who have taken the floor before me 
regarding the concerns and challenges facing the 
Pacific Island States. As island States, we are 
vulnerable to the forces of nature because of our 
remoteness and small populations. As island States, we 
are affected by factors such as shortage of manpower 
and technical capacity, weak institutional capacity, 
limited financial resources and too little foreign direct 
investment. We lack information and access to 
environmentally friendly and affordable technologies, 
including new and sustainable energy sources. Our 
challenges are intensified by a lack of commitment 
from the United Nations to support our development 
aspirations. We hope that the High-level Panel’s report 
will recognize these special challenges and propose 
realistic solutions. 
 Sustainable development and basic human rights 
cannot thrive in a world without peace and security. We 
must continue to strengthen our collective efforts in 
resolving conflicts and threats of terrorism through 
prevention and effective political solutions. 
 The proliferation of small arms continues to pose 
a threat to peace and security in our region. My 
delegation shares the view of the Secretary-General in 
his report that, “These weapons may be small, but they 
cause massive destruction” (A/61/1, para. 102). Nauru 
is deeply concerned that the 2006 Small Arms Review 
Conference ended without agreement on further 
measures to combat this problem. If it is true that 
whoever is faithful in the small things will also be 
faithful in the bigger things, then how can we progress 
towards the elimination of weapons adaptable to mass 
destruction while failing to agree on the issue of small 
arms and light weapons? 
 Finally, “Can two walk together, except they be 
agreed?” Let us reflect on this passage from the Book 
of Amos as we renew our partnership of commitment 
to spare no effort. "
7141,62,2007,PLW,"On behalf of the President of 
Palau, Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr., and the people of 
Palau, let me begin by offering my congratulations to 
the General Assembly President on his election and 
assuring him of our cooperation in the coming year. We 
express our appreciation to the Group of Asian States 
and the General Assembly for the confidence they have 
demonstrated by electing a representative of Palau as a 
Vice-President. Palau is the smallest country in the 
history of the United Nations to have this honour, and 
we take it very seriously. 
 Palau congratulates the Secretary-General on his 
leadership on stopping the genocide in Darfur. We were 
moved by the calls for immediate action that we heard 
from President Bush and others here at the United 
Nations. In this respect, I wish to announce that Palau 
will send peacekeepers to Darfur and will play our part 
in this critical demonstration of international concern. 
 Despite our capacity issues, this will not be 
Palau’s first peacekeeping deployment. But while we 
are a responsible and proud Member of the United 
Nations, we note the continuing lack of a permanent 
United Nations presence in Palau. Last June, the 
United Nations Development Programme, the United 
Nations Population Fund and UNICEF announced that 
eight new joint offices would open in Pacific island 
countries, including Palau. We welcomed that historic 
accomplishment, but we are concerned at the fact that 
the offices have yet to open. Existing mechanisms 
appear to have blocked progress on the ground. But we 
believe that the original goals and intentions of the 
project can be salvaged if there is a will to respond to 
the needs of small island nations like Palau. We would 
welcome the intervention and assistance of our 
partners, as well as the recommitment of the Secretariat 
to our original shared goals. 
 We note the President’s call to ensure that the 
United Nations as an organization and we as Member 
States are properly prepared to confront terrorism. 
Palau has worked to improve its anti-terrorism 
capacity. We have also met with the Counter-Terrorism 
Committee Executive Directorate to advance our 
requests for assistance, particularly in the area of 
combating money-laundering and terrorism financing. 
Unfortunately, the efforts of the Directorate have been 
insufficient. Our hope is that during the sixty-second 
session of the General Assembly, the United Nations 
will be able to help small countries in addressing this 
threat and in meeting our Security Council obligations. 
 The Pacific is home to some of the world’s 
largest and most important biodiversity hotspots. Our 
ocean ecosystems provide the backbone for Palau’s 
existence, and we are committed to their preservation. 
Last year, our nations banded together to protect 
vulnerable marine ecosystems from deep-sea bottom 
trawling, a destructive fishing practice responsible for 
95 per cent of worldwide damage to seamounts. As a 
result, the South Pacific Regional Fisheries 
Management Organization adopted interim measures 
that took a substantial step towards eliminating this 
unsustainable practice. We encourage all other regional 
fisheries management organizations and flag States to 
follow this example, and we remind them of the 
deadlines to take action. 
 Palau has been vocal in its crusade to end bottom 
trawling because of its effects on ocean ecosystems. 
The North Pacific is home to some of the world’s best 
fisheries. Their diversity is the key reason for the 
Micronesia Challenge, an initiative launched by 
President Remengesau, whereby countries and 
territories of Micronesia have joined together to 
conserve 30 per cent of near-shore marine resources 
and 20 per cent of land resources by the year 2020. 
This project is the first of its kind in the world. It 
covers 6.7 million square miles of ocean, and it will 
help protect 10 per cent of the world’s coral reefs, 
including more than 60 threatened species. 
 While eliminating bottom trawling and 
establishing protected areas are certainly important 
actions, they will be fruitless if rapid progress on 
climate change cannot be made at the international 
level. We are no longer in total control of our destiny. 
When temperatures increase, our corals bleach, the 
seas rise and the oceans acidify, threatening to 
demolish our marine biodiversity, jeopardizing our 
livelihoods and eventually destroying our identity. 
 In the light of the high vulnerability of small 
island developing States to the impact of climate 
change, we stress the absolute need to reach an 
agreement on a set of quantified emission reduction 
targets for the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol. These emission reduction targets must be 
ambitious, must reflect the urgency of our collective 
circumstances and must be consistent with a mitigation 
framework that protects the most vulnerable parties to 
the Convention, in both the short and the long-term. It 
is imperative that the effectiveness of the post-2012 
regime address the issue of mitigating the impacts of 
climate change on small island developing States, as 
the key benchmark of its adequacy and effectiveness.  
 We note too the ongoing debate on General 
Assembly reform and join our voices with others who 
note the need for concrete results on Security Council 
reform. Without Security Council reform, there can be 
no genuine United Nations reform. The early 
conclusion of the discussion is essential. Japan has 
demonstrated its concern for and commitment to the 
Pacific and the international community. It should be a 
permanent member of the Security Council. That is 
true too of India, the largest democracy among 
developing nations, whose contributions to global 
security have earned it the right to a permanent seat on 
the Security Council. We have supported and continue 
to support the draft resolution of the Group of Four and 
hope that the Assembly will address the resolution this 
year. 
 We also note our disappointment that Taiwan 
continues to be excluded from this Hall. The world 
would benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the United 
Nations and other international institutions. We were 
disappointed that the Secretary-General failed to 
follow the Charter and the rules of the Security Council 
by refusing to transmit and circulate Taiwan’s 
membership application to the Security Council and 
the General Assembly. Ultimately, legitimate 
democracies must be recognized and supported across 
the breadth of our planet no matter how large or small 
the country. 
 On behalf of Palau, a small and peaceful island 
nation in the wide Pacific Ocean, let me thank all of 
you in my country’s native language: Kom Kmal 
Mesulang. 
"
7159,62,2007,PNG,"I wish  to express to Mr. Srgjan Kerim, President of the 
General Assembly at its sixty-second session, Papua 
New Guinea’s congratulations on his election. We 
assure him of my country’s full cooperation during his 
presidency. We compliment his predecessor, Her 
Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, for her 
stewardship of our work during her tenure, and we 
wish her well in her future endeavours. 
 I would like to express our support to the 
Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, 
for his leadership of the United Nations. Let me thank 
him, in particular, for his courage and strong leadership 
on the issue of climate change. By the same token, I 
would also like to thank the staff of the Secretariat and 
all United Nations agencies who continue to give 
valuable service to my country, Papua New Guinea. 
 On 18 September 2007, two days after 
celebrating 32 years of independence, Papua New 
Guinea convened its eighth National Parliament. This 
was a result of another successful general election. 
Democracy is a challenge, but Papua New Guinea 
continues to thrive under it. My country of more than 
800 tribes and languages continues to find in the 
democratic principles the binding force and unity in 
diversity in the 32 years of unbroken democracy. 
 Papua New Guinea remains committed to the 
principles and purposes of the United Nations. We 
agree with the President that we must continue to work 
with common purpose to renew, modernize and 
strengthen this Organization so it can rise to the 
challenges of the twenty-first century. 
 The increasing incidence of human atrocities, 
genocide and war, poverty, terrorism, HIV/AIDS, the 
resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, the 
proliferation of small arms and light weapons, drug and 
human smuggling, environmental degradation and 
climate change are issues that, we believe, the United 
Nations is best placed to address. 
 Again we agree with the President that global 
challenges demand multilateral solutions. The United 
Nations is the appropriate multilateral forum to take 
such action. That is why the revitalization of the 
General Assembly deserves our highest attention. To 
revitalize the Assembly is also to renew our faith in 
each other and in our common values and destiny. 
 We strongly endorse the President’s five priority 
issues of climate change, financing for development, 
achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), countering terrorism, and the United Nations 
reform agenda. To complement efforts in other forums, 
Papua New Guinea with other countries of the Pacific 
region has agreed to pool our limited resources under 
the Pacific Plan, in order to address, as the basis of our 
cooperation, many of these same issues, in particular, 
sustainable development, climatic change and regional 
integration. 
 Let me turn now to an issue which my country 
feels strongly about: climate change. To be clear, we 
are very concerned to see certain industrialized nations 
attempting to avoid responsibility for their own carbon 
emissions and shifting the focus to developing nations. 
Only after industrialized nations take responsibility for 
the consequences of their own actions will the pathway 
become clear for lasting solutions. 
 However, as developing countries, we are willing 
to contribute equitably towards a sustainable future. 
During my earlier statements at the high-level event on 
climate change, I put forward key principles needed to 
guide future international agreements on climate 
change after the year 2012. 
 The time for leadership is now. If we are to defeat 
this self-inflicted calamity, we must succeed in six key 
areas: we must construct a shared vision for lower 
global greenhouse gas concentrations; we must 
aggressively deepen reduction commitments by 
industrialized countries; we must create more 
mechanisms to provide positive incentives for 
developing countries; we must launch a global 
framework to reduce emissions from deforestation and 
degradation; we must scale up adaptation financing for 
future generations; and we must mobilize sufficient 
and sustainable resources to support positive incentives 
and adaptation. 
 The science is clear. Our planet is in distress. As 
co-inhabitants of this world, we all must address the 
root causes of the problem. To succeed, leadership is 
required on both sides of the economic divide. 
Together, and only together, we can grasp the 
challenges before us and construct a sustainable future. 
 Papua New Guinea supports the ongoing reforms 
in the United Nations Secretariat. In order to 
strengthen it to better address some of the key 
challenges facing the membership, reform should 
reflect the geopolitical, economic and social realities of 
today, taking into particular account the different levels 
of development facing the membership. Above all, the 
reform must be fair and equitable. 
 Global trade today is uneven and characterized 
more by unfair trade practices by those already holding 
decided advantages than by the opportunities it offers 
to developing countries like Papua New Guinea. Our 
efforts to develop a more equitable trading order are 
hampered by the reluctance of our developed partners 
to open their economies and engage in genuine 
development discussions. 
 The Doha Round of negotiations are at a critical 
juncture. We need to collectively ensure that those 
negotiations are revived so that different trade needs of 
its members are addressed. 
 Papua New Guinea has moved forward from an 
export-driven economic growth strategy to a policy of 
economic consolidation and empowerment. Its core 
policy objective is to provide every Papua New 
Guinean equal opportunity to build home, community 
and country. To achieve this, strong emphasis will be 
placed on agriculture, which has always been the 
mainstay of our rural populace. Along with this aim, 
relevant infrastructure will be built to support that 
important sector. 
 The country’s five-year medium-term development 
strategy is being reviewed to strengthen its alignment 
with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
Achieving the MDGs by 2015 is a challenge that 
requires our collective input in its implementation. 
 We call on development partners, including the 
United Nations, to play a supportive role in 
implementing and sustaining these activities. That can 
be done through fair trade opportunities, equitable 
markets, increased foreign investment, transfer of 
technology, capacity-building and providing quality 
overseas development assistance. 
 The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a serious threat to 
social and economic security in many of our countries. 
Greater efforts must be made to arrest it. In Papua New 
Guinea, my Government has passed HIV/AIDS 
legislation underpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS 
policy framework. We consider HIV/AIDS to be a 
development issue and deal with it separately from 
other health issues. But our experience suggests that 
national action alone is not enough. A concerted global 
response is required. HIV/AIDS is a threat that must be 
addressed on all fronts and by all countries. We thank 
the United Nations and its related agencies for their 
efforts in addressing HIV/AIDS. We also thank former 
President of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, for his 
contribution to this work in my country.  
 Of equal importance are the battles against 
malaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. 
While, as a global community, we have focused on 
HIV/AIDS and avian flu, little attention is given to 
malaria, which remains the biggest killer disease in my 
country. We therefore thank Mr. Bill Gates for 
assistance given to research work on malaria in Papua 
New Guinea. We call upon development partners to 
support Papua New Guinea and other countries in 
addressing these challenges. 
 Despite many United Nations resolutions, the 
conflict in the Middle East remains unresolved. Papua 
New Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict, 
including those Powers that have the capacity to 
influence a positive outcome, to make the necessary 
concessions for a peaceful resolution to this long-
standing issue. We appeal to all parties to make full use 
of the dispute-settlement procedures of the United 
Nations. 
 The work of the Special Committee on 
Decolonization remains unfinished. There are still 16 
Non-Self-Governing Territories   some in the 
Pacific   that have yet to exercise their right to self-
determination. The forthcoming referendum in Tokelau 
demonstrates once again the true spirit of cooperation 
between Tokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate 
both Governments and assure the people of Tokelau of 
our respect for their ultimate decision. In the same 
vein, we hope that other Administering Powers will 
follow the example of New Zealand and assist other 
territories reach a decision of their choice. 
 While our world today provides untold 
opportunities, we are at the same time faced with many 
complex challenges. We must renew our commitment 
to and faith in the United Nations and seek to reform it 
in ways that are reflective of the realities of today. 
Thirty-two years ago, when I brought my nation to take 
its seat in the General Assembly, I said, and wish to 
reaffirm today, that, within the limits of our resources, 
Papua New Guinea will play an active and positive role 
in the United Nations. That commitment remains. 
"
7169,62,2007,MHL,"I bring warm greetings of 
“iakwe” from the people of the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands, on whose behalf I have the honour to 
address the General Assembly at its sixty-second 
session. 
 I wish to convey our congratulations to you, 
Mr. President, on your election in the presidency of the 
Assembly at this session. I am confident that, under 
your able leadership, consensus on crucial issues will 
be achieved, benefiting the entire membership, 
particularly the often-forgotten remote small island 
States of the Pacific. My commendation also goes to 
your predecessor for her successful stewardship of the 
work of the Assembly at its sixty-first session. 
 Allow me to also congratulate you, 
Mr. Secretary-General, for your election as the eighth 
Secretary-General of this Organization. Steering the 
United Nations in today’s interwoven world of 
complex trials and tribulations remains ever more 
challenging, and I wish to express my country’s 
confidence in your stewardship and to commend you 
for your current efforts in taking a range of measures to 
strengthen the capacity of the United Nations. 
 For the past 62 years, we have come to this 
Assembly to express various issues and concerns dear 
to our heart, as they affect the daily lives of our 
citizens. Education, health and the environment are 
among the issues at the top of my country’s priorities, 
but these issues are nothing if we, the community of 
nations, fail to attempt to avert the forthcoming 
ecological disaster.  
 My people are concerned with   or rather 
terrified by   with the issue of our very survival. Will 
we even exist 50 years from today? If we are to exist at 
all, we must put a stop to the rising tide of destruction 
unleashed by global warming. Our future   or 
perhaps, our absence of future   depends on the 
decisive actions of this Assembly. I find no pride in 
having coined the term “ecological refugee”. It is my 
deepest hope that no one, and certainly no one in the 
Marshall Islands, will have to bear that name. 
 Since my election more than seven years ago, 
educating the world about the threat my people face as 
a result of sea-level rise and global warming has been 
one of my Government’s priorities. In addressing the 
issue of climate change, actions and real progress are 
needed. In saying this, I am proud to announce the new 
alliance that my Government established earlier this 
year with the local government of Martin Luther King 
Jr. County, in Washington State in the United States, 
aimed at confronting the threat posed by global 
warming. 
 The unwavering faith I have in this Organization 
is the reason why I am standing at this podium today 
on behalf of my people. On our shoulders, as leaders, 
lies the responsibility entrusted to us, to keep not only 
the peace to live in harmony and with dignity, but to 
preserve our environment to ensure the very survival of 
our children for generations to come. 
 I commend the Secretary-General for convening a 
high-level meeting on climate change this week. I am 
also hopeful that we, as leaders, will come up with the 
necessary agreements on the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change in 
December. While we are committed to playing our part, 
strong leadership is required by the major 
industrialized countries. We once again renew our 
support for the Framework Convention and the Kyoto 
Protocol, and we call upon all States that have not yet 
done so   in particular the major emitters   to ratify 
the Protocol without further delay. We also call upon 
the international community to assist small island 
developing States in developing and implementing 
comprehensive adaptation strategies. 
 I remain hopeful that the international community 
can reach a consensus on moving forward the 
necessary agreements to achieve lasting peace, security 
and diplomatic solutions to the seemingly endless web 
of issues. We are so integrated and interconnected 
today that we all face equal challenges, be it in 
terrorism or the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I 
commend this Assembly for adopting last September 
the historic United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy, which will prevent the global scourge of 
terrorism. The Marshall Islands remains committed in 
the fight against terrorism, and we continue to take 
action at the national level and to cooperate at the 
regional and international levels to ensure that we 
combat terrorist threats with comprehensive and united 
action. 
 In the area of disarmament and non-proliferation, 
our collective efforts need to be invigorated to 
overcome stalemate. Nuclear weapons and the testing 
conducted on our islands in the past is a nightmare that 
continues to haunt my people. The 67 atmospheric 
weapons detonated on my island of Bikini Atoll from 
1946 to 1958 continue to inflict pain and suffering on 
my people to this day. The Marshallese people were 
under the care of the United Nations Trusteeship 
Council when the United States nuclear testing 
programme was in progress. Once again, I call on the 
United Nations and its agencies and Member States 
who share similar experiences and have the expertise to 
assist us with the restoration of our radiation-
contaminated environment to provide the needed 
assistance for my people’s health-care needs that are 
linked to radiation exposure, and to support the 
Marshall Islands’ Changed Circumstances Petition, 
which was submitted to the United States Congress in 
2000. 
 I commend the work of the Assembly at its sixty-
first session in adopting resolution 61/109, which 
requests the United Nations Scientific Committee on 
the Effects of Atomic Radiation to continue its work, 
including its activities to increase knowledge about the 
levels, effects and risks of ionizing radiation from all 
sources, and requests the United Nations Environment 
Programme to continue to provide support for the work 
of the Committee and for the dissemination of its 
findings and to review and strengthen the Committee’s 
present funding. I am confident that my people will 
benefit from the Committee’s work, noting that 
previous policy and resettlement decisions based on 
misleading scientific opinions have caused so much 
suffering among my people. 
 My people’s survival and well-being also depend 
on our ocean resources. We are encouraged by 
international and regional agreements and treaties that 
aim to protect these scarce resources. However, illegal, 
unreported and unregulated fishing continues to 
threaten our major source of livelihood. In protecting 
our ocean resources from exploitation, we continue to 
seek assistance from Member States with the expertise 
and capacity in conducting and enforcing conservation 
and management measures, as well as in the 
development of our domestic fisheries. I reiterate once 
again my support for a moratorium on bottom-trawling 
until there are clear indications on its negative effects 
on the ocean biodiversity.  
 The Micronesia Challenge   a commitment led 
by the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of 
Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands   
aims at conserving that biodiversity and our vulnerable 
ecosystem by effectively conserving at least 30 per 
cent of the near-shore marine and 20 per cent of the 
forest resources across Micronesia by 2020. The 
Micronesia Challenge is part of a much larger and 
growing commitment by island nations throughout the 
world to take the international lead in preserving 
primary ecosystems. I call on the international 
community to support the efforts that have been put in 
place and to develop and provide the resources for 
realistic financial plans in support of conservation and 
sustainable use of our natural resources. 
 Within the Pacific region, we continue to 
cooperate closely to ensure that effective regional 
actions are taken in our endeavour to combat our 
vulnerabilities in the economic, social and 
environmental areas, which are priority areas 
highlighted under the Pacific Plan and Kalibobo 
Roadmap, endorsed by Pacific leaders almost two 
years ago.  
 My Government has had the pleasure of hosting 
and actively engaging in several regional meetings held 
to that effect. The Eighth Pacific Islands Conference of 
Leaders, which I was honoured to chair in Washington; 
the Seventh Annual Micronesian President’s Summit, 
held in Chuuk, Federated States of Micronesia, earlier 
this month; the seventh Food and Agriculture 
Organization meeting of the South West Pacific 
Ministers for Agriculture, held in May; and the 
Micronesians in Island Conservation conference, held 
last June in Majuro   all these provided the 
opportunity for our leaders, development partners and 
non-governmental partners to meet with other leaders 
from the region to address the wide range of issues and 
challenges that continue to plague the Pacific. 
 In my view, the successful implementation of 
regional commitments international obligations can be 
achieved only with the support and commitment of 
member countries, regional and international 
organizations, development partners and a range of 
stakeholders. 
 In that regard, I wish to emphasize that the 
assistance of the international community, which has 
played a crucial role in enabling us to meet current and 
emerging challenges, is still very much needed. There 
is only so much that we can do as small island 
developing States; thus, now more than ever, I continue 
to call on the international community for considerable 
investments and comprehensive assistance, including 
the much-needed policy reorientation to address the 
interlinked issues of economic, social and 
environmental security. 
 The Republic of the Marshall Islands was 
founded on the ideals of freedom, democracy and 
respect for human rights. We continue to observe and 
stand for those democratic values and the defence and 
promotion of human rights. The United Nation’s noble 
ideals of good governance, democracy, multilateralism 
and respect for human dignity also serve as my guiding 
light in my capacity of high steward of my people. 
 However, while the United Nations continues to 
work with States in resolving disputes peacefully and 
in helping to create democratic societies, it still turns a 
blind eye to the 23 million people of Taiwan and 
silences their voices. The absence of Taiwan in the 
United Nations creates a gap in the global network for 
cooperation, goes against the ideals and concept of 
justice upheld by the United Nations and contravenes 
the principle of universality. 
 We reiterate our support for the reform and 
expansion of the Security Council and for a criteria-
based approach under which potential members, such 
as Japan, must be well qualified, based on factors such 
as economic size, population, commitment to 
democracy and human rights, financial contributions to 
the United Nations and contributions to United Nations 
peacekeeping efforts. 
 During the general debate of the sixtieth session, 
we noted in this historic Hall that the United Nations 
and its offices and agencies did not have a permanent 
presence in many of the small island developing States 
of the Pacific. In June 2006, it was announced that a 
coalition of the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) and United Nations Population Fund 
(UNFPA) would open a total of eight new offices in the 
Pacific island countries. We welcomed that historic 
accomplishment, the progress it marked towards 
harmonization within the United Nations and the 
assistance and support the new offices would provide 
in developing national capacity and meeting the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
 We, Member States that pay our dues, deploy 
peacekeepers, and discharge our responsibilities in the 
international community, deserve offices that give 
relevance to the United Nations and the 
implementation of its doctrines. The Marshall Islands 
is appreciative of the work currently under way for the 
establishment of a joint presence in our country by 
UNFPA, which will be the leading agency on behalf of 
UNDP and UNICEF. We, however, ask the General 
Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that offices 
befitting the ideals and reputation of the United 
Nations are established in the other identified Pacific 
island countries. 
 In closing, I wish to reassure you, Mr. President, 
that the Marshall Islands remains committed to the 
implementation of the commitments made over the last 
decade, and we expect our partners to fulfil their 
commitments as well. The sustainable development of 
small island developing States, such as the Marshall 
Islands, can only be achieved through a genuine 
partnership within the international community. Only 
then can we realize the commonly shared goal of 
universal peace and prosperity. 
 My delegation looks forward to a productive 
session under your able leadership, Sir. Komol tata, 
and God bless. 
"
7175,62,2007,NZL,"As we meet for the 
sixty-second session of the General Assembly, we look 
again to the United Nations as the global forum to 
address the challenges which affect us all. 
 Climate change is serious and urgent, as many 
have said in this Hall. We welcome that it has been the 
theme of our general debate this year. The science is 
clear. Climate change is real and will impact on all 
parts of the world. To meet the global challenge of 
climate change, there must be widespread and effective 
international action. It will be important to get all 
economies onto low carbon pathways over time. 
Market mechanisms will have a significant role to play. 
Individual countries will face different challenges. 
Different national circumstances must be taken into 
account. 
 The United Nations climate change conference in 
Bali in December will be a fresh opportunity to 
re-energize our efforts in addressing climate change. 
New Zealand wants to see a Bali road map emerge in 
December to set us on the course for an effective future 
response. New Zealand welcomes the momentum that 
is being generated by other high-level meetings in the 
lead-up to Bali, including the recent Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Declaration. 
 Last week’s high-level event deserves special 
mention. We congratulate the Secretary-General for his 
efforts in cultivating the political goodwill that will be 
vital if we are to reach agreement in Bali.  
 Taking action as an international community also 
means taking action domestically. In recent weeks, 
New Zealand has announced a number of domestic 
measures to address climate change. An emissions 
trading scheme will be established from 1 January 
2008 and will form the cornerstone of our efforts to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will, over time, 
cover all sectors and all gases. 
 We have also identified a number of longer-term 
domestic goals, which will move New Zealand down 
the path to carbon neutrality. They will provide 
benefits, including healthier homes, cleaner air and 
improved public transport. While climate change is 
certainly a challenge for us all, it is also an opportunity 
to move towards a more sustainable world. 
 With regard to the Millennium Development 
Goals, we recognize that having passed the halfway 
point to 2015, the international community needs to 
step up its efforts to achieve them. At the same time, 
there is scope for the United Nations development 
system to be strengthened. We welcome the newly 
established initiatives in the Economic and Social 
Council   the Annual Ministerial Review and the 
Development Cooperation Forum   as practical ways 
to share information about what is working and where 
we can improve our efforts at country level. 
 New Zealand is also committed to improving 
system-wide coherence at the United Nations in the 
fields of development, humanitarian issues and the 
environment. We attach particular importance to 
working for a strengthened, coherent, gender 
architecture and towards effective gender 
mainstreaming across all United Nations entities. 
 New Zealand welcomes the completion of the 
United Nations Pacific-based development agencies’ 
strategic framework for the Pacific. We are keen to 
work closely with United Nations agencies in the 
Pacific to achieve positive outcomes for our partners in 
the areas of human rights, sexual and reproductive 
heath, HIV/AIDS, child immunization and women’s 
leadership. 
 A strong, prosperous and stable Pacific is a key 
foreign policy priority for New Zealand. We place a 
high priority on fostering solidarity and cooperation in 
the Pacific to tackle the challenges the region faces in 
democracy, security and economic development. 
Around half of New Zealand’s development assistance 
goes towards the Pacific.  
 New Zealand provides assistance in the region in 
Timor-Leste, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and 
Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, with each situation 
calling for a different response. 
 The Timorese people, their leaders and the 
international community have all made a huge effort 
over the past year to return Timor-Leste to a more 
secure and stable path. New Zealand has participated in 
those efforts through our contributions to the 
International Security Forces and to the United Nations 
Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). Timor-
Leste will require a sustained commitment from 
UNMIT.  
 The situation in Fiji continues to be of concern to 
New Zealand. As a neighbour of Fiji with a long-
standing and very close relationship, New Zealand 
worked hard to avert last December’s coup, including 
by convening a meeting to mediate between the then 
Prime Minister and the military commander. We very 
much regret that this failed to dissuade the coup 
makers from their illegal and unconstitutional path. 
 New Zealand strongly and actively supports the 
steps that have been taken by the Pacific Islands Forum 
to encourage an early return to constitutional 
government in Fiji. We would welcome a firm 
commitment from the interim administration to work 
towards elections within the timeframe endorsed by the 
Forum. Given that commitment, New Zealand would 
begin to restore a more normal bilateral relationship 
through which we could cooperate in addressing Fiji’s 
undoubtedly complex problems. 
 I also want to take this opportunity to address one 
issue in particular raised in the Solomon Islands 
statement on Monday (see ). It was 
suggested, inter alia, that the presence of the Regional 
Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI), 
was an “occupation”, and that RAMSI’s operation 
transgressed Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. 
New Zealand has always been committed to upholding 
the purposes and principles of the Charter in every 
respect. In our view, RAMSI is entirely consistent with 
those purposes and principles. It is a specific example 
of Chapter VIII of the Charter in operation. To suggest 
it is contrary to the Charter is in our view wrong. 
RAMSI was established in response to a formal request 
from the Solomon Islands. Its presence in the Solomon 
Islands is sanctioned by treaty and by the domestic law 
of the Solomon Islands. That was recently reaffirmed 
by the Solomon Islands Parliament. Moreover, RAMSI 
stems from the endorsement by Pacific Islands Forum 
Foreign Ministers of a programme of action under the 
Forum Leaders’ Biketawa Declaration. That provides a 
framework for regional responses in times of crisis or 
when members request assistance   exactly the 
situation in this case. 
 Amid all these challenges, I would like to report 
on activity being undertaken by Tokelau, the tiny 
territory 500 kilometres north of Samoa that New 
Zealand administers. The people of Tokelau, all 1,500 
of them on three atolls, have decided that they wish to 
undertake an act of self-determination to decide 
whether they wish to change their present status. A 
vote in February 2006 narrowly missed the threshold 
set by Tokelau for a change of status. They will again 
vote on that issue from 20 to 24 October. 
 As members of the Special Committee on 
Decolonization know, New Zealand supports Tokelau’s 
right to choose, but has stood back from any wish to 
determine the direction of any change. That decision is 
entirely for the people of Tokelau. New Zealand will 
support their decision. 
 Advancement of the rule of law at the national 
and international levels is essential for the realization 
of sustained economic growth, development and 
human rights. New Zealand encourages members to 
provide their full support to the International Criminal 
Court (ICC) by acceding to the Rome Statute of the 
ICC. We also call on all United Nations Member 
States, especially State parties to the Rome Stature, to 
fully cooperate with the Court in carrying out its 
current work. Universality and full support are crucial 
if we are to end the impunity of the perpetrators of the 
most serious crimes of international concern, such as 
those carried out in Darfur, where International 
Criminal Court arrest warrants are outstanding. 
 Efforts to protect and maintain the international 
rule of law can only be effective when built on a 
foundation of international peace and security. 
 Interfaith and intercultural dialogue can help to 
counter religious extremism by encouraging 
understanding and respect among different faith 
communities and cultures. 
 In May, New Zealand hosted two significant 
gatherings aimed at advancing global response to 
interfaith and intercultural issues in a practical way. We 
regard the United Nations’ Alliance of Civilizations as 
the key multilateral process among the growing 
number of international and regional initiatives in this 
area. 
 With respect to nuclear proliferation, New 
Zealand welcomes the strong signals that have been 
sent to North Korea and Iran by the Security Council. 
 On a different topic, New Zealand is convinced 
that the humanitarian harm posed by cluster munitions 
must be addressed urgently. We believe that negotiation 
of a treaty to deal with the problems caused by cluster 
mines is well overdue. We will host a meeting on this 
initiative in February of next year. 
 We are pleased, too, to promote a new initiative 
at the General Assembly this year calling for action to 
lower the operational status of nuclear weapons. 
Maintaining nuclear weapons at a high level of 
readiness increases the likelihood of these weapons 
being used, with catastrophic consequences. 
 The humanitarian disaster and conflict in Darfur 
threaten security in the entire East African region. New 
Zealand applauds the efforts by Members to establish 
the new African Union-United Nations Hybrid 
Operation in Darfur. 
 New Zealand is deeply concerned at the current 
political, economic and humanitarian situation in 
Zimbabwe. We welcome the efforts being made to find 
acceptable solutions to the problems Zimbabwe faces. 
We sincerely hope that these efforts continue and that 
solutions can be found that will benefit all 
Zimbabweans and will enable free and fair elections to 
be held. 
 New Zealand remains profoundly concerned at 
the situation in Myanmar. Protestors have been killed, 
shot at, beaten and arrested. This violent treatment is 
reprehensible. Engaging in peaceful protests is a 
fundamental human right. New Zealand, therefore, 
joins others in calling for the immediate release of 
those detained in recent weeks, along with the many 
political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who 
have been held without trial for much longer periods. 
 The Myanmar regime should be held responsible 
for the personal safety and treatment of all the people it 
has detained. We call on the authorities there to stop 
the violence and to encourage a process of genuine 
dialogue with pro-democracy leaders and ethnic 
minorities. 
 New Zealand fully supports United Nations 
efforts to resolve the immediate and longer term 
situation in Myanmar. We welcomed the visit to 
Myanmar of Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari. We fully 
support continued discussion of the situation of 
Myanmar in the Security Council with a view to 
considering what further steps might be taken by the 
international community. 
 Turning now to human rights, New Zealand will 
stand for election to the Human Rights Council for 
2009 to 2012. We want to do our part to help this 
fledging United Nations organization achieve its full 
potential as the pre-eminent global human rights body. 
 A human rights issue of particular importance to 
New Zealand is the death penalty. Adoption of a 
resolution on a global moratorium on this inhumane 
form of punishment would represent a historic step 
towards global efforts to abolish the death penalty. 
 In closing, New Zealand has been a committed 
and active participant in the United Nations since its 
formation. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called 
on Member States to deliver to the best of our abilities 
at the United Nations, recognizing the need for faster, 
more effective action, as well as for a more results-
driven Organization that strives to have the highest 
standards of transparency and professional ethics. New 
Zealand whole-heartedly agrees.  
 We look forward to working closely with the 
Secretary-General, with you, Mr. President and with 
other Member States in all of our efforts to build a 
stronger United Nations for a better world. 
"
7227,62,2007,KIR,"I bring warm greetings 
from my Government and the people of the Republic of 
Kiribati, on whose behalf I am honoured and privileged 
to address this important gathering this afternoon. 
 Allow me to join preceding speakers in offering 
my sincere congratulations to Mr. Kerim on his 
election as President of the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second session. I am confident that with his 
wisdom, experience and diplomatic skill, he will steer 
the course of this Assembly to a successful conclusion. 
Let me assure him that Kiribati pledges its full support 
to him in the performance of his challenging task. 
 I take this opportunity to also extend my 
appreciation to his predecessor for the exemplary way 
in which she guided the proceedings of the sixty-first 
session of the General Assembly. 
 I wish to commend as well the Secretary-General 
and members of his team in the Secretariat for their 
perseverance and relentless efforts in pursuit of the 
goals of the United Nations. In particular, I 
congratulate the Secretary-General on his sterling 
leadership of this Organization since taking over his 
top and challenging job at the beginning of this year. 
Our world is confronted more than ever with a 
number of serious threats and major challenges. Every 
year, we all come together from different parts of the 
world to this beautiful city of New York with our hopes 
of finding practical and workable solutions to those 
challenges. Indeed, situations in some regions of the 
world show no sign of improvement and are further 
confronted by crises that have proven difficult to settle. 
Those challenges affect us each as individual countries, 
small and big, rich and poor, developing and 
developed. In a world characterized by globalization 
and interdependence, the need for the human family to 
undertake constructive and sustained cooperation has 
become more urgent. 
 With the growing complexity and uncertainty of 
events in this world of ours, especially in the context of 
globalization and with the emergence of new 
challenges to peace and security, the fulfilment of the 
role of the United Nations remains critical. Kiribati 
remains committed to supporting the reform of the 
United Nations. 
 We continue to believe that the reform of this 
Organization is in the best interests of humanity, and 
we would like to see the reform processes move 
forward and be concluded as early as practicable in 
order for the Organization to be able to respond 
effectively to today’s challenges to global peace, 
security and economic and social progress. 
 Seeking peace and economic development 
represents the common wish of all nations. Without 
global peace there can be little positive development in 
our countries. Kiribati is committed, within its resource 
and capacity constraints, to working closely with other 
like-minded countries in pursuit of world peace and 
stability, economic development and progress of 
mankind. As the only universal multilateral 
international organization, the United Nations remains 
the best forum for allowing all States to come together 
to resolve problems of a global character, regardless of 
their size or wealth. 
 States Members of the United Nations are all too 
aware that globalization has brought us all to a point at 
which everything is interconnected and the well-being 
of almost every citizen is affected by global 
developments. Events that happen in one part of the 
world have a direct bearing on the rest of the world. 
 Sometimes however, we are all affected and 
involved in a much more substantial way. Like other 
least developed countries and small island developing 
States, Kiribati has so many constraints. Our very 
remoteness from world market centres, narrow 
economic base and high population growth rates are 
factors that we must contend with. The continuing 
sharp increase in world oil prices and our total reliance 
on imported oil and fossil fuel has already put a lot of 
pressure on our economy. Our options for containing 
the adverse impact of increasing world oil prices are 
very limited. We must also contend with the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic and tuberculosis, among others, which 
require the diversion of the already meagre resources 
we have at our disposal to finance our development. 
 Those complex economic situations of ours will 
continue to undermine our efforts and determination to 
realize the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals and other internationally agreed 
development goals. In order to be able to realize our 
aspirations to attaining sustainable economic 
development and to sharing the benefits of 
globalization, Kiribati would like to call on the 
international community to look at a new global 
strategy that would create an enabling economic 
environment for the most disadvantaged States 
Members of this noble institution, such as my own. 
 Even with those complex economic development 
challenges, we are forced to operate in an environment 
of uncertainty. I say “uncertainty” as our very survival 
as a nation and as a people with a distinct culture and 
way of life is at great risk, as we are being threatened 
by global warming and sea-level rise. 
 Our islands are widely dispersed and small; most 
rise barely over 0.2 metres above mean sea level. For 
countries such as Kiribati, global warming and sea-
level rise are critical security concerns. Those concerns 
are ones that we, as individual countries and as 
members of this collective body, need to continue to 
work together to address. 
 We will continue to call on the international 
community to agree on a unified global response to 
those environment issues. We will also continue to 
work with like-minded countries in pushing the case 
for a unified global response to those issues. As a small 
country, Kiribati places great confidence on the 
international community for its survival, and we hope 
that our repeated appeals to this body to address that 
critical issue will receive stronger political support and 
commitment this time. There is no more time to debate 
the issue, as climate change is now a fact of life. It is 
now time to put words into action so that this living 
planet is protected from complete destruction and 
preserved for use by our many generations to come. 
 We wish to commend the Secretary-General for 
his initiative in calling the high-level event on climate 
change on 24 September this year. That in itself means 
a lot to those who are now living under the cloud of 
desperation, fear and uncertainty. We remain confident 
that further meaningful actions will follow and that 
consensus will soon be achieved on finding a global 
solution to climate change before it is too late. 
 Terrorism is an ongoing concern that affects all 
countries large and small. Kiribati condemns terrorism 
in all its various forms and manifestations and will 
continue to support the global fight against terrorism. 
 This time last year, Kiribati joined other States 
Members of the United Nations in expressing our 
disappointment over the continued neglect and 
rejection of the desire of the 23 million people of 
Taiwan to join this Organization. It is further saddening 
to note that Taiwan’s request for admission this year 
was again not given a fair opportunity to be heard by 
the General Assembly. 
 With a population of 23 million, giving it the 
forty-seventh largest population in the world, Taiwan 
has continued to respect and abide by the United 
Nations Charter based on the principles of democracy, 
mutual respect and understanding. We feel that Taiwan 
and its 23 million people deserve justice from this 
noble institution. It is Kiribati’s fervent hope that 
Taiwan will one day be given the nod to assume its 
rightful place in this highly respected Organization. 
 Let us all work together to make this world a 
better place   a place where citizens of all of our 
nations can live together in harmony, peace, security 
and prosperity for many years to come. 
"
7246,62,2007,AUS,"I join my colleagues in 
congratulating you, Sir, on your election as President 
of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. I 
would also like to wish His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-
moon well for this, his first full session of the General 
Assembly as Secretary-General.  
 On behalf of the Australian Government, let me 
begin by reaffirming Australia’s long-standing call for 
reform of the United Nations. Australia strongly 
supports efforts to make the Organization more 
effective. And Australia would like to acknowledge 
Secretary-General Ban’s push for reform so far. 
 But reform of the United Nations is not an end in 
itself. We must reform the United Nations so that it can 
act decisively to meet global challenges. Simply 
talking about issues does not solve problems. 
 Over the past 60 years, when the United Nations 
has acted it has proved its worth. United Nations 
peacekeeping operations around the world have saved 
lives and helped communities rebuild. Australia has a 
proud history of supporting them. Australia was the 
first country on the ground in what was arguably the 
first-ever United Nations peacekeeping operation, the 
1947 Consular Commission to Indonesia. In the past 60 
years, Australia has made contributions to 39 United 
Nations peacekeeping operations, and we continue that 
tradition today. 
 The United Nations, as the only Organization 
with a truly global membership, has both a unique 
opportunity to meet challenges and a responsibility to 
take action. By coming together, we can achieve more 
than each of our countries could on its own. The 
United Nations has great moral authority. But, if it fails 
to act decisively, that authority will be squandered. 
 As Members of the United Nations, we have set 
ourselves important goals over the past 62 years: 
maintaining global peace and security, supporting 
economic and social development and advancing 
human rights. In 2005, we pledged to protect those 
people who are most vulnerable: those facing genocide, 
war crimes and crimes against humanity. We 
recognized the responsibility to protect as a central 
tenet of our shared humanity.  
 This responsibility to protect underpins the notion 
that States must protect their own populations. But, if 
they should fail to do so, the international community 
has a responsibility to act, not to stand idly by in the 
face of atrocities, genocide or ethnic cleansing. For the 
international community, that means we must commit 
to prevent and respond to these most serious of 
crimes, wherever they occur. After the immediate crisis 
has passed, we must support recovery efforts to help 
communities rebuild and reconcile, by addressing the 
causes of the crisis. 
 Last year, the Security Council drew upon the 
responsibility to protect for the first time in a country-
specific resolution: resolution 1706 (2006), on Darfur. 
And, under a subsequent resolution, an African Union-
United Nations hybrid peacekeeping operation was 
established, with a robust mandate to protect civilians 
and humanitarian workers. The international 
community must now ensure that the deployment of 
the Hybrid force proceeds quickly. Active cooperation 
is needed across the international community if we are 
to keep our promise to the people of Darfur. The 
alternative — to fail — is unthinkable. This is a test for 
the United Nations and its Member States. 
 But resolving the tragedy in Darfur is, first and 
foremost, a test for the Government of Sudan and other 
parties to the conflict. Ongoing military operations by 
the Government of Sudan, and last weekend’s killing 
and abduction of African Union peacekeepers by rebel 
forces, demonstrate the urgent need for the parties to 
stop these crimes and build peace. Those who have 
committed crimes in Darfur must be punished. 
 Australia calls on the Government of Sudan to act 
on the warrants issued by the International Criminal 
Court. We call on Sudan to arrest those accused and to 
hand them over to the Court. 
 Darfur is not the only humanitarian crisis we 
have experienced or will face in the United Nations. 
Tragically, other populations will also require 
protection from crimes against humanity. The 
responsibility to protect provides the necessary guide 
to action. But it is up to Security Council members, on 
behalf of the international community, to act, and for 
all United Nations members to then support them. 
 The events of the past week in Burma remind us 
of the irrepressible human impulse to seek democratic 
freedoms and human rights. The United Nations and 
individual countries must let the courageous protestors 
in Burma know that their message is understood — a 
message on the need to move towards genuine 
democratic progress and national reconciliation, and 
away from military domination. 
 Australia has joined the international community 
in condemning the violent suppression of peaceful 
demonstrations by monks and civilians. We call for the 
immediate release of those arrested for exercising their 
fundamental human rights to peaceful protest and for 
humane treatment of all those detained. Australia is 
also introducing targeted financial measures against 
members of the Burmese regime and its supporters to 
increase pressure on them to engage in genuine 
political reform and national reconciliation. 
 Australia supports the consistent efforts that the 
United Nations has made to monitor and improve the 
situation in Burma. We welcomed the statement by the 
United Nations Security Council following its special 
consultations on 26 September. We welcome the 
current visit to Burma by the United Nations Secretary-
General’s Special Envoy, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, and his 
access to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We urge the 
Burmese authorities to work constructively and 
meaningfully with him in support of his United 
Nations-mandated mission. Mr. Gambari is well placed 
to assist in achieving a peaceful resolution to the 
current crisis. 
 The responsibility to protect means that we, the 
international community, must act when confronted 
with the most serious of crimes. But we also have to 
act to confront a range of global challenges, from 
terrorism and climate change to poverty. Terrorists 
stand in stark contrast to those of us who seek to 
protect the vulnerable. Their goals are global and their 
reach transnational. No single country can solve the 
problem alone. There have been some successes in 
combating terrorist networks, but we need to develop 
even more effective strategies to disrupt and dismantle 
their networks. 
 Australia calls on Member States of the United 
Nations to implement fully all relevant Security 
Council resolutions on freezing the assets of terrorists. 
Terrorist organizations must be starved of their funds 
and support. Australia also calls on Member States to 
conclude a comprehensive convention against terrorism 
as soon as possible. A convention would provide a 
solid foundation for international cooperation to 
prevent, prosecute and punish terrorist acts. 
 The international community must support the 
efforts of States that fight terrorism — in particular, 
fledgling democratic States. We must help those States 
to establish strong democratic institutions and 
accountable Government structures, as State weakness 
can only allow terrorism to fester. 
 We should cooperate also to prevent man-
portable air-defence systems from falling into the 
hands of terrorist groups. We should also intensify 
work on the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism. Australia urges Member States to join the 
Initiative. 
 We must also act to stop the spread of weapons of 
mass destruction. Australia welcomes the robust action 
taken by the Security Council over the past year in 
imposing sanctions against programmes relating to 
proliferation in the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea and also in Iran. The Security Council’s action 
on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear 
issue sent a strong signal to that country that the 
international community would not tolerate its nuclear 
programmes. We welcome recent progress in the Six-
Party Talks. We call on the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea to maintain the momentum and 
implement fully its commitment to denuclearize. 
 The Security Council also sent a strong message 
to Iran. We welcome Iran’s stated intention to work 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
to address long-outstanding issues. But the 
international community, including Australia, remains 
deeply concerned about Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran 
should suspend its uranium enrichment programme, as 
required by the Security Council, and cooperate fully 
with the IAEA. 
 Australia also hopes that the United Nations can 
continue its work in protecting populations by raising 
barriers against the illicit trade in conventional 
weapons. We support the development of an arms trade 
treaty. 
 Climate change is another challenge that clearly 
requires our urgent attention. Climate change demands 
an effective and enduring global response. The United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is 
the forum to forge such a global response. On 9 
September, the leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies issued the 
historic Sydney Declaration on Climate Change, 
Energy Security and Clean Development. The APEC 
leaders agreed to work to achieve a common 
understanding on long-term aspirational goals to 
reduce emissions and pave the way for an effective 
post-2012 international arrangement. 
 Significantly, the APEC leaders, whose 
economies represent over half of the world’s gross 
domestic product (GDP), agreed that the post-2012 
agreement needs to be comprehensive and that all 
economies should contribute to meeting shared global 
goals. They also agreed that our responses must be 
equitable and environmentally and economically 
effective, as well as capable of including diverse 
approaches. 
 The High-Level Event on Climate Change, hosted 
by the Secretary-General on 24 September, and the 
Major Economies Meeting on Energy, Security and 
Climate Change, hosted by United States Secretary 
Rice a few days later, highlighted these same goals and 
built additional international momentum for a post-
2012 agreement. Australia calls on parties to this year’s 
United Nations conference on climate change in Bali to 
agree to a new mandate for the Convention that will 
move beyond Kyoto and forge a comprehensive new 
agreement. 
 The international community must also address 
pressing health and human security issues, in particular 
the spread of HIV/AIDS. Failure to combat HIV/AIDS 
will have global economic and social consequences. 
Australia takes its responsibility to act seriously and 
continues to support its near neighbours in the Asia 
Pacific region to address the challenge of HIV/AIDS. 
 The Australian Government believes that the 
challenge of ending endemic poverty remains the 
single most difficult economic and social issue, and yet 
the most fundamental one. In a world where 
international commerce moves at the click of a button, 
people should not be starving. Commerce and 
economic development have the power to lift people 
out of poverty. Free and open trade helps countries to 
develop through integration into the world trading 
system. We must conclude the Doha Round and deliver 
results that increase market access and reduce domestic 
subsidies. 
 Development assistance, too, plays a key role in 
alleviating poverty. At the United Nations Summit in 
2005, Australia undertook to double its development 
assistance budget by the year 2010, and we are well on 
the way to achieving that goal, but this aid must be 
focused and delivered in a way that promotes broad-
based economic growth and encourages good 
governance. We need to make long-term commitments, 
particularly in post-conflict development and 
reconstruction.  
 I have outlined today serious global challenges 
facing the international community — humanitarian 
and political crises, including in Darfur and Burma, 
climate change, poverty, weapons of mass destruction 
and terrorism. The Security Council has drawn upon 
the responsibility to protect principle, endorsed by 
leaders at the 2005 Summit. It is clear that the 
international community as a whole has a 
responsibility to protect those facing genocide, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. 
 Our task is to respond quickly and effectively. 
The United Nations has been vested with great 
authority by its Members to effect real change. But that 
authority will mean little unless we turn commitment 
into action. 
"
7252,62,2007,NRU,"I would like to express my 
sincere congratulations to Mr. Srgjan Kerim on his 
election as President of the General Assembly at its 
sixty-second session. My delegation also wishes to 
commend his predecessor, Sheikha Haya Rashed 
Al-Khalifa, for her leadership of the General Assembly 
at its sixty-first session, particularly in addressing the 
difficult issues that continue to prevent revitalization of 
the General Assembly and reform of the Security 
Council. My delegation offers its full cooperation and 
support towards the President’s commitment to 
continuing with the Organization’s overall reform 
agenda and addressing the many challenges ahead. 
 As this is the first General Assembly session to 
be convened since the appointment of His Excellency 
Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General, my delegation 
takes this opportunity to assure him of Nauru’s firm 
support and full cooperation in his leadership of the 
United Nations. 
 I am deeply honoured to be addressing this body 
for the third consecutive year, this time as the recently 
returned leader of our small island State of Nauru. As 
members are no doubt aware, when I first took up 
office, three years ago, my country was on the brink of 
collapse. While Nauru was once a small donor country 
with a high income, our wealth was squandered in a 
single generation through gross mismanagement and 
corruption on the part of previous Governments. Our 
past record of poor governance and the need to rebuild 
Nauru were the main reasons that our national 
sustainable development strategy was initiated by our 
Government and given one of its fundamental goals: 
the establishment and operation of a transparent and 
accountable Government. 
 My Government is slowly but diligently working 
to improve Nauru. Over our three-year term, we will 
continue to do so, on a platform of both economic and 
political reform, together with good governance. We 
believe that we are improving our situation, and the 
August election results tell us that we have our 
people’s confidence. But it is a slow and painful 
recovery, and we appreciate all the help that we can 
get. 
 We appreciate the fact that the United Nations is 
strongly aware of the development challenges in the 
Pacific region and that it is also cognizant that 
assistance has not translated into uniform human 
development gains in many places, with the result that 
the Pacific is in danger of missing many targets of the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that 
respect, my delegation welcomes and supports the 
President’s intention to hold a leaders’ meeting on the 
MDGs during the present session. 
 During the general debate at the sixty-first 
session (see A/61/PV.16), we noted in this historic Hall 
that the offices and agencies of the United Nations had 
no permanent presence in many of the small island 
developing States of the Pacific. In June 2006, it was 
announced that a coalition comprising the United 
Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and the 
United Nations Population Fund would open a total of 
eight new offices in Pacific island countries, including 
my own country, Nauru. We welcomed that historic 
announcement, the progress that it marked towards 
harmonization with the United Nations and the 
assistance and support that the new offices would 
provide in developing national capacity and meeting 
the MDGs. 
 As Member States that pay our dues, deploy 
peacekeepers and discharge our responsibilities in the 
international community, we deserve offices that 
enhance the relevance of the United Nations and the 
implementation of its policies. We have therefore been 
severely disappointed by the lack of progress in 
establishing acceptable offices in our countries since 
the announcement. The delaying of that initiative, and 
the assumptions on the part of the United Nations 
concerning the capabilities of our small island States to 
recruit staff for such offices, are also short-sighted. 
Moreover, the Organization’s definition of 
“partnership” for the initiative places a significant 
burden on our national Governments. It fails to respond 
to our national priorities and our lack of resources, and 
therefore weakens the cohesion between the 
Organization and our countries. 
 Despite the lack of visible progress, we are of the 
view that the project can be salvaged with its original 
intentions and goals intact if there is a will and a 
sincere desire to respond to our needs. So we ask the 
General Assembly and the Secretariat to ensure that 
offices befitting the ideals and the reputation of the 
United Nations are opened in our countries. We want to 
see the United Nations on the ground in Nauru and 
throughout the Pacific region, providing a helping hand 
in our pursuit of sustainable development. 
 There can be no doubt that our Pacific region is 
doing its best to implement the commitments made 
under the Mauritius Strategy and other international 
agreements regarding small island developing States. 
The relevant report of the Secretary-General 
(A/62/279) makes that very clear, showing that under 
its Pacific Plan, the Pacific region has agreed to and is 
vigorously pursuing its own sustainable development 
priorities, which reflect and acknowledge our 
international commitments under the Strategy. The 
Secretary-General’s report and the Pacific Plan updates 
show progress in some key areas and identify 
important initiatives for follow-up action. 
 However, it is also quite clear that we and the 
United Nations need to do much more. That fact is 
glaringly obvious in the recent report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
which warns of a narrowing window of opportunity 
available for slowing down global warming and 
climate change. This is an issue that reveals some of 
the inequities in the current world development 
paradigm: the small island countries contribute very 
little to the problem but are likely to be the worst 
affected. 
 The need to do more also stares us in the face 
from recent reports on the progress, or lack thereof, in 
achieving MDGs. Our region is struggling in many 
areas of the MDGs, and it is fair to say, as the 
Secretary-General’s report notes, that persistent 
capacity constraints are a key obstacle to the 
implementation of sustainable development in the 
Pacific region   this includes Nauru. 
 Therefore, I take this opportunity to express my 
people’s warmest appreciation to our development 
partners, led by Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, 
Japan, the European Union and others, for their support 
in this and other areas, without which we would have 
completely collapsed as a nation and as a people. 
However, I hope the Assembly can appreciate that our 
region, although vast, suffers both from isolation and 
the relatively small size of its countries and 
populations.  
 Even with the best practices in management and 
governance, our economies’ sustainable development is 
impeded by high transportation costs and diseconomies 
of scale. In Nauru, freight adds at least 15 to 20 per 
cent to the cost of all imports. Likewise, affordable and 
sustainable alternative energy forms are a high priority 
for my country and region because, with the ever 
increasing cost of fossil fuel, we are having to pay a 
high premium for something that contributes both to 
global warming and to our potential demise as Pacific 
islands.  
 Professor Jeffrey Sachs has rightly said that, 
while we all need to work together to solve world 
poverty, the opportunity is there for the developed 
countries with their resources and technology to do 
something about ending it once and for all. The agreed 
official development assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per 
cent of a gross national product is far from being 
achieved. This highlights the opportunity for the world 
to do much more to both alleviate poverty and remove 
the constraints that frustrate the progress of many 
developing countries. 
 Like other highly indebted countries, mine is 
doubly burdened by a massive debt left to us by 
previous Governments. After careful assessment of 
Nauru’s development potential for the next thirty years, 
we have come to the sad conclusion that Nauru will 
only be able to service a very small portion of that 
debt. We will need to seek the forgiveness of those 
countries and institutions to which we owe most of the 
money.  
 This Organization prides itself on being inclusive 
and on being a champion to everyone; yet my 
delegation is extremely disappointed that, despite the 
efforts of Nauru and other allies of this cause, the 
United Nations continues to ignore the expressed wish 
of Taiwan and its 23 million people to become a 
member of this Organization. 
 On the 19 July this year, an application for 
membership to the United Nations was delivered to the 
Office of the Secretary-General, signed by the 
democratically elected President of Taiwan, His 
Excellency Chen Shui-bian. Unfortunately, the United 
Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the 
Security Council were then contravened. Owing to 
poor legal advice, the Office of the Secretary-General 
failed to forward Taiwan’s application for membership 
to the Security Council, citing General Assembly 
resolution 2758 (XXVI) for its failure. Even though 
many Member States continue to hide behind 
resolution 2758 (XXVI), it should be realized that this 
resolution does not declare that Taiwan is a part of the 
People’s Republic of China, nor does it preclude 
Taiwan from future membership of this body. It 
certainly does not support the so-called one China 
principle. 
 Ever since the establishment of the People’s 
Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the two sides of 
the Taiwan Strait have been governed separately, with 
neither side exercising any control or jurisdiction over 
the other. Let me be absolutely clear: Taiwan has no 
intention of representing the People’s Republic of 
China. Taiwan is a free and peace-loving sovereign 
State, and its democratically elected Government is the 
sole legitimate Government of their island State.  
 Apart from the legal and moral rights of Taiwan 
to be part of the United Nations, there is another 
dimension that needs to be taken into account. Taiwan 
is one of the largest economies in the world, including 
being one of the larger trading partners of other 
Members of the United Nations. It is also one of the 
top twenty sources of world foreign investment and is 
well positioned to assist many of the members of this 
body in their development, which it has already 
demonstrated. Taiwan is a very important investor and 
trading partner for my country and others in my  
region   even for those that do not recognize it 
formally.  
 My delegation calls on the Office of the 
Secretary-General to uphold the integrity of this pre-
eminent Organization and conform to the United 
Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the 
Security Council. It must immediately accept and 
submit to the Security Council Taiwan’s application for 
membership.  
 Peoples of the world look to the United Nations 
and to their leaders to identify and act on major global 
challenges that confront the world today. Earlier this 
week, we concluded a High-Level Event on Climate 
Change. Our discussions encompassed a variety of 
views and proposals that we all hope will lead to global 
resolve to achieve significant changes. Nauru takes the 
view that the international community, particularly 
those countries with the capacity that comes with their 
status as developed nations, has a responsibility to 
provide financial, humanitarian and other assistance to 
small island developing States that stand to suffer the 
most dire consequences of global climate change.  
 Of course, we must acknowledge and express 
gratitude for those aid policies that have been proposed 
and established, but more is needed to avert a potential 
disaster, especially to the vulnerable small island 
nations. Therefore, we ask that ongoing efforts be 
continued and urge Member States to consider 
increasing their financial support, including easier 
access to the Adaptation Fund. 
 However, capital investments alone are not 
sufficient. Technology, skills and knowledge are 
required to guide us in our response to the present 
challenge. Furthermore, civil society and non-
governmental organizations must cooperate with each 
other in acquiring and building the capacity we need to 
address this problem.  
 The world situation demands a renewed, 
revitalized and more responsive United Nations now 
more than ever. We need to see the strengthening of 
this multilateral institution through the revitalization of 
the General Assembly and comprehensive reform of 
the Security Council through intergovernmental 
negotiations. All of that must move forward with a 
common vision for a more coherent United Nations 
system capable of delivering as one, sparing no efforts 
to continue strengthening the three pillars of peace and 
security, development and human rights.  
 Nauru is of the view that the comprehensive 
reform of the Security Council will not be complete 
without Japan, India, Brazil and Germany as permanent 
members. 
 In closing, I wish to remind this Assembly of the 
Secretary-General’s recent observation of the United 
Nations, whereupon he stated: 
“The true measure of success for the United 
Nations is not how much we promise, but how 
much we deliver for those who need us most.” 
(A/61/PV.31) 
As we move forward our discussions on the many 
challenging and complex issues before us, let us do so 
with the best of intentions, and more importantly, let us 
make good our promise to deliver.  
 Finally, while I stand in this great country of the 
United States of America, the land of the free, I cannot 
help but remember that its people have put their trust in 
God. On my island country of Nauru, also a land of the 
free, we have placed our belief in God’s will first. 
Therefore, to every human being on our planet Earth, I 
beseech each and every one of us to dedicate ourselves 
to hold true to our God’s will. 
"
7286,62,2007,VUT,"I bring to this Assembly 
warm greetings from the people of Vanuatu. 
 Today is an important day in the histories of four 
of our Members of the United Nations family, and my 
Government and the people of Vanuatu congratulate 
the people of Tuvalu, Nigeria and Cyprus on their 
independence anniversaries, and the people of the 
People’s Republic of China on the anniversary of the 
founding of that great nation. 
 Let me also join others in extending our 
felicitations to you, Sir. You take up your high position 
at a time when the United Nations is confronted by 
some enormous challenges. The uncertainty shrouding 
the horizon will severely test our common resolve to 
address global problems.  
 The escalating tension and animosity in the world 
today are an affront to the principles and values of the 
Organization and ultimately challenge international 
order. What the world needs right now is a hand of 
friendship to rebuild trust and faith among and between 
Members. The resounding war of words must not be 
accepted with complacency. 
 As one of the smallest members of the United 
Nations family of nations, Vanuatu would like to 
reaffirm its commitment to building global peace and 
security. We will also continue to participate in United 
Nations peacekeeping missions. 
 May I also take this opportunity to acknowledge 
the anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade some 
200 years ago. My country also suffered tremendously 
from those horrendous acts executed by the great 
champions of deception and iniquity, who were 
responsible for enslaving thousands of men, women 
and children and shipping them to foreign shores under 
inhumane conditions using malicious torture. The days 
of blackbirding are long gone, but the bitter memories 
and injurious social consequences are entrenched in the 
history of my country and people. I honour all the 
descendants of slaves for their courage and their 
determination to live on. They deserve a special place 
in the countries in which their forefathers were forced 
to live. There also remains a huge debt owed to the 
countries that suffered large human losses from those 
heinous crimes against humanity. We cannot exonerate 
the past, but we can all hope for a just and better 
future. All countries must work together to prevent 
other insidious contemporary forms of slavery that 
have established themselves in our societies. 
 I welcome and support the decision to make 
climate change the theme of this session of the General 
Assembly. In the same vein, my Government highly 
commends the Secretary-General for convening last 
week’s high-level meeting, which should provide an 
important catalyst for the conference to be held later 
this year in Bali. 
 I should now like to take this opportunity to 
recognize and commend the work done under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change to address the effects of climate change and to 
promote mitigation and adaptation strategies. But the 
point must be made that rapidly reducing the emission 
of greenhouse gases by all major emitters must be 
ensured within the next 10 to 15 years.  
 We followed with great interest the recent debate 
about the criteria and rules that the United Nations uses 
to decide whether a country should or should not be 
removed from its list of least developed countries. 
Graduation is desirable and fair if, and only if, it is the 
culmination of a process of structural progress over 
time   that is to say, progress based on irreversible 
improvements in the structure of the economy or in the 
basic indicators of development. It is only fair and 
logical, therefore, that the criteria used as a basis for 
identifying a country for graduation should be 
structural criteria. 
 The United Nations currently uses three criteria 
to identify cases for graduation. Admittedly, only two 
of the three are structural in nature. One relates to 
human capital   essentially as regards health and 
education   and the other to economic vulnerability. 
The proponents of reform of the graduation rule rightly 
postulate that those two criteria together should form 
the basis for identifying a country for graduation. The 
current graduation rule allows the United Nations to 
declare a country ready for graduation even if only one 
of those two paramount thresholds has been met. We 
consider the current practice to be conceptually flawed 
and fraught with serious implications. We believe this 
anomaly can easily be remedied. 
 My Government is of the view that the General 
Assembly should invite the Economic and Social 
Council to revisit the graduation rule in the light of the 
ongoing debate, and that the experts who advise the 
Council should be mandated to explore reform of the 
rule with a view to making human assets and economic 
vulnerability paramount. Such a reform would do 
justice to countries that have not achieved the implied 
structural progress. The Government of Vanuatu will 
do its utmost to cooperate with the relevant United 
Nations bodies and other like-minded nations and 
friends in forging consensus on this matter. I am 
convinced that such consensus implicitly exists, and 
needs only to be formalized. 
 Experts and members of the Committee for 
Development Policy should also be encouraged to 
undertake in-country consultations and to experience 
first-hand the development conditions of countries that 
are on the verge of graduation. We are talking about the 
livelihoods of peoples who may be seriously affected 
by decisions that are made at the United Nations. 
 We must continue to work together in shaping the 
architecture of the United Nations so that it is more 
resourceful and relevant to our times and to the peoples 
whom we represent. 
 I would like to commend the United Nations for 
increasing its presence in the Pacific region though its 
country-based offices. We will encourage more 
decentralization of functions to regional offices, which 
are better suited to responding to the needs of 
Members.  
 The situation in the Middle East is of grave 
concern to all peace-loving Members of the United 
Nations. We earnestly pray and hope for an early end to 
the conflict and to the suffering of all innocent 
children, women and men. Both Israel and Palestine 
have the right to live in peaceful coexistence as 
independent and sovereign States. The international 
community must be realistic about the future. Let us 
allow justice, security and long-lasting peace to prevail 
for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. 
 My Government very much welcomes the 
adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. It is our hope that the Declaration 
will provide a framework for addressing the grievances 
of indigenous peoples, who remain suppressed, 
alienated and disadvantaged in the land of their 
forefathers. We can only hope that this instrument will 
provide an enabling mechanism to allow indigenous 
peoples the freedom to fully participate, without fear of 
reprisals, in the affairs and development of their 
countries. The Declaration should also serve to restore 
dignity to those who have remained second-class 
citizens in the land of their fathers. We cannot turn 
back the clock, but we can create a better future for 
them. 
The Charter of the United Nations espouses the 
principles that continue to guide the Organization’s 
efforts in the process of self-determination. The 
Charter calls for recognition of, and respect for, the 
fundamental and inalienable rights of people and 
territories still under colonial rule to determine their 
own future. We cannot champion democracy while 
turning a blind eye to those who have cried out for 
peace and freedom for many years, as have our 
brothers in West Papua. It is the moral responsibility of 
the Organization to act with diligence and to work 
towards promoting better conditions in larger freedom. 
 Finally, I would like to acknowledge the support 
of Vanuatu’s major development partners   in 
particular Australia, New Zealand, France, Japan, the 
People’s Republic of China, the United States of 
America and the European Union. I would also like to 
express my Government’s gratitude to India, Thailand, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Turkey and various 
United Nations agencies for their ongoing 
contributions to the development of Vanuatu. 
 In conclusion, the world we live in today can 
only become a better place if all countries   big and 
small, powerful and weak   recognize, understand, 
value and respect each other as equals. The pride of the 
human person is the essence of building equality 
between all persons. Respect also means accepting the 
national sovereignty of each individual country and 
refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of any 
State. If we are to work towards building a future that 
will provide security, peace, hope and prosperity for all 
future generations, those important values must be 
upheld at all times. 
 May I remind the Assembly that our personal 
aims should not be paramount. We must work with all 
the diligence and wisdom that God the Almighty has 
given us to serve His people.  
"
7343,56,2001,MHL,"﻿On behalf of the
Government and the people of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands allow me to offer cordial
congratulations to the President on his election as
President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth
session, and to offer the Marshall Islands unreserved
cooperation in our deliberations at this session.
I must also express my sincere gratitude to his
predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, whose outstanding
leadership was instrumental in making the fifty-fifth
session, coined the Millennium Assembly, highly
successful.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands also pays
tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second
term as Secretary-General, as well as on winning the
prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, which is a very well-
deserved and timely recognition of the Organization
and of the Secretary-General’s wisdom and dedication
to the service of mankind.
It is with a heavy heart and deep sorrow that the
Government of President Kessai Note and the people of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands reiterate to the
Government and people of the United States of
America their deepest sympathy and condolences for
the suffering and pain caused by the terrorist attacks of
11 September. Similarly, we wish to convey our
heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the other great
nations that were directly affected by that tragic and
inhuman act. They were not alone in their daily trials
and tribulations; the Republic of the Marshall Islands
was with them. Furthermore, we extend our solidarity
and condolences to the Government and people of the
Dominican Republic, who suffered losses in the recent
crash of American Airlines flight 587.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns
all acts of terrorism. I am pleased to inform the
Assembly of the ratification by the Government of the
Marshall Islands of six conventions and treaties related
to terrorism. They are the Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material, the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against
Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic
Agents, the International Convention for the
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the Convention for
the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the
Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for
the Purpose of Detection, and the International
Convention against the Taking of Hostages.
The marked worldwide increase in behaviours
abhorrent to human dignity, freedom and basic rights of
innocent people encouraged the early ratification of the
Rome Statute by the Marshall Islands, which calls for
the establishment of an International Criminal Court.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes an
early establishment of the Court and the
implementation of its mandate.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands remains
fully committed to the principles enshrined in the
31

human rights bill. The Government is currently in the
process of ratifying the following conventions: the
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the
International Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination; the United Nations
International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights; and the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. We are committed to accede
to them in a timely manner.
Given the unique conditions under which we seek
our livelihood, our Government has been readily
supportive of new scientific breakthroughs and
innovations for the betterment of the world. However,
we feel there are certain scientific initiatives that run
counter to human decency. In this regard, we fully
associate ourselves with the call by the Governments of
Germany and of France for a universal convention
banning human cloning for reproductive purposes. We
believe that such a scientific endeavour would directly
violate the Universal Declaration on the Human
Genome and Human Rights, drawn up by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization and endorsed by the General Assembly in
resolution 53/152. Article 11 of that Declaration
specifies that
“Practices which are contrary to human dignity,
such as reproductive cloning of human beings,
shall not be permitted.”
As in the past, the Republic of the Marshall
Islands will continue to voice in the strongest terms
possible and in the best form at its disposal, its
concerns and fears over issues relating to climate
change and rising sea levels. The Assembly is aware
that several Pacific island countries are represented in
this Organization. Like other small island countries, the
Republic of the Marshall Islands is plagued by a unique
set of problems. Our coastal zones have become highly
vulnerable to erosion, our groundwater systems are
affected by high levels of saltwater intrusion, and
increasing salinity is having a direct impact on our
subsistence cropping. Such vulnerabilities, together
with prolonged drought, constitute a deadly peril for
our health and survival.
We welcome the successful outcome of the sixth
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
which recently concluded in Marrakesh. The Kyoto
Protocol is the best available solution to address our
environmental concerns. We should be able to look
back in the coming days and commend ourselves for
the mission that is to be accomplished. We owe it to
our children and to our children’s children.
The Millennium Declaration, adopted by heads of
State or Government during the Millennium Assembly,
should serve as our guiding framework and road map
for achieving sustainable development, eradicating
poverty, combating HIV/AIDS, preventing illegal
trafficking in small arms and safeguarding the
environment.
Immediately following the Millennium Assembly,
President Kessai H. Note convened a broad-based
economic and social summit, the outcome of which
was the development of a national planning vision — a
guiding framework for a long-term national
development programme. I commend Member States
for their generous support and assistance for this
initiative.
The Government of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands is of the view that the United Nations must
move forward proactively in its reform process. We
commend the Secretary-General for his reform
programme. However, much more needs to be done.
We encourage the Fifth Committee and United Nations
funds and programmes to support and cooperate in the
reform process.
The Government of the Republic of the Marshall
Islands fully supports the expansion of the Security
Council in both the permanent and non-permanent
categories, based on equity, to include developed and
developing countries so as to respond to the realities
and challenges of our contemporary world. We note
that certain issues need to be agreed on. We should
move forward with broad-based agreement and revisit
our differences.
Now that this Organization has 189 Member
States, 14 of them being from the Pacific region, the
reconfiguration of our electoral groupings should be an
additional matter to be placed on the table. It may be a
complex issue, but through our collective efforts and
inspiration, the goal can be achieved, and it should be
considered without further delay.
The exclusion from this body and its related
agencies of the Republic of China on Taiwan is a
major, serious hindrance to the Government of the
32

Republic of China on Taiwan in its pursuit of its
fundamental rights to participate in international
dialogue and regional organizations and activities. The
time has come once again to reconsider the exclusion
of the Republic of China on Taiwan from this
prestigious body. There is so much that the Republic of
China on Taiwan could do, in cooperation with the
United Nations system, in the areas of sustainable
development, technology, health, peace and prosperity.
In conclusion, the Republic of the Marshall
Islands pledges its commitment to the principles
enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
God bless the United Nations.



"
7347,56,2001,NRU,"﻿I bid the Assembly welcome
from the people of Nauru, the pleasant little island of
the Pacific. Let me avail myself of the opportunity to
extend to you, Sir, my Government’s belated
congratulations on your assumption of the presidency
of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.
Much of the work of the United Nations since the
despicable attacks on the United States of America on
11 September has been focused on counter-terrorism,
and this is understandable. The Security Council’s
adoption of resolution 1373 (2001), obligating
Members to implement anti-terrorist measures, should
recognize the importance of supporting existing
regional initiatives in the fight against terrorism. To
this end, we welcome the undertakings by the Security
Council Committee on Counter-Terrorism.
The World Bank has predicted that the events of
11 September will exacerbate the already gloomy
global economic outlook. Its ripples will be felt across
all of the world’s regions, particularly in countries
dependent on tourism, remittances and foreign
investment. It is thus critical that the Security Council
allow the competent bodies of the United Nations to
assess the costs of extending, expanding or adding new
peacekeeping operations before their implementation.
Nauru joins the international community in
offering our belated but heartfelt congratulations to
Mr. Kofi Annan and the Organization on being the joint
recipients of this year’s prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.
The former President of the General Assembly,
Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, has to be commended for
capitalizing on the momentum generated by the
Millennium Declaration.
My delegation is pleased to endorse your
proposed agenda, Mr. President, for the fifty-sixth
session. The work of the General Assembly should be
relevant to the tasks at hand, but at the same time it
should address long-standing issues affecting the
efficiency and status of this body. Meaningful
cooperation between Member States must always be
encouraged across the boundaries of religion, ethnicity
2

and culture. The recent World Conference against
Racism is a stark reminder of how the work of the
United Nations will otherwise continue to be
frustrated; but the one significant area where the
United Nations has made little or no progress is on the
question of the reform of the Security Council. We
would therefore support a proposal to move the process
to a higher level and to deal with the complex issues in
a step-by-step fashion.
The last meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum
leaders was held in my country a few months ago. The
communiqué of that meeting has been circulated as a
document of the United Nations. In that communiqué
the Forum leaders sought to formalize cooperation
arrangements between the United Nations and the
Pacific Islands Forum. I would like to take this
opportunity to kindly request your support of the
relevant draft resolution.
The issues of climate change and sea-level rise
continue to be of major concern to my country, and we
have repeatedly voiced our deep concern about the
adverse impact of human-induced climate change,
especially on the low-lying atolls around the Pacific.
We have stressed the importance of efforts to build
appropriate human and institutional capacity.
The Kyoto Protocol represents a significant step
forward on the path to taking action to combat climate
change, but unless significant action is taken on a
practical compliance regime, there is little prospect of
any outcome being enforceable.
Nauru therefore looks forward to participating
with the rest of the world in Johannesburg next year to
review the progress made since Rio, and it is our
fervent hope that the Kyoto Protocol will have come
into force by then.
There is a special urgency for Nauru. Economic
growth in our small country has been negative for more
than a decade, and, as reflected in recent revisions of
our classification by the United Nations and the United
Nations Development Programme, our per capita
income has fallen by almost 80 per cent since the
1980s. We look to the international community, the
United Nations and its various agencies to assist us
through these difficult times and to help secure a safe
future for our children.
Our region, the world’s very first nuclear-free
zone, has a long history of supporting disarmament and
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, born of the
region’s harsh experience with nuclear testing by
colonial Powers. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders
have again expressed their desire for the entry into
force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
Nauru will be depositing its instrument of ratification
today, and I call on other States to follow suit.
The trans-shipment of radioactive material and
MOX fuel, through our exclusive economic zones is a
continuing concern, but we are committed to pursuing
our concerns constructively and vigorously at the
appropriate political level.
Nauru’s commitment to the international effort to
combat money-laundering is unwavering. Our
Parliament passed anti-money-laundering legislation in
August of this year to correct the deficiencies in our
regulatory and administrative arrangements. However,
Nauru is disappointed not to have graduated from the
list of special non-cooperating countries despite the
fact that the legislation was drafted in close
collaboration with Financial Action Task Force on
Money Laundering (FATF) regional representatives.
We will nonetheless continue to work on satisfying the
key players in FATF on this issue, and we look forward
to working with our regional partners under the Pacific
regional action plan being developed.
Nauru, along with 20 other Member States, again
supported the inclusion of a resolution on the
admission of the Republic of China on Taiwan on the
agenda of the fifty-sixth session. While the attempt
failed, Nauru will not be discouraged from continuing
its efforts to correct this anomaly. We on Nauru
wholeheartedly believe that the Republic of China on
Taiwan has a part to play in this Organization, and its
people should not be denied a voice in this world body.
We note with pleasure the recent admission of the
Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization.
Finally, I wish to end my statement by revisiting
the issue of security and terrorism. It is indeed sad that
as we meet here today, there is a war going on in the
world - a war against terrorism. Prior to the horrific 11
September attacks on the United States of America, my
Government, at the request of the Government of
Australia, agreed to the use of Nauru as a refugee-
processing centre. We made this decision on
humanitarian grounds. As a consequence, we now have
on Nauru nearly 800 asylum seekers from Afghanistan,
3

Iraq and Palestine — 10 per cent of the whole
population of Nauru — along with migration personnel
from the United Nations, the International Organization
for Migration and Australia. The asylum seekers are
now being processed.
I have taken it upon myself to personally visit the
camps from time to time and to mingle with these
unfortunate people, and on several occasions have sat
down and broken bread with them. I found that they are
like you and me. They are brave human beings seeking
a better life for themselves and their children and
escape from the oppression back home.
The resources of the United Nations need to be
augmented to cope with this humanitarian tragedy, and
the international community needs to urgently tackle
the problem in a coordinated manner, not only in terms
of providing assistance and refuge where possible,
but also in terms of addressing the sources and causes
of refugees, people- smuggling and terrorism.
Understanding and responding will not necessarily
solve the problem, but it will make it easier for
Governments to share in the continuing international
effort that will be needed.
Finally, may I say that the good old days, before
11 September, are gone forever, and I shed a tear. The
sad part is that we inherited a world that was good
from our forefathers. Today, I ask, do we leave
tomorrow a better world for our children and our
children’s children? That I ask. Mr. President, we look
to you for leadership on these vital issues.
Thank you. May God bless those in sorrow. May
God bless the United States of America. And may God
bless the United Nations.




"
7371,56,2001,PLW,"﻿Let me begin by
conveying my deepest sympathy and condolences to
the families and relatives of the victims of American
Airlines flight 587, which crashed in this great city two
days ago, exactly two months and one day after the 11
September terrorist attack. The people of New York are
once again being put to the test, and once again they
will come out of this tragedy more resolved and
determined, under the leadership of Mayor Giuliani and
Governor Pataki. While we pray for the victims and
their families, let us also pray that the crash, as tragic
as it was, will prove to be an accident and not an act of
terrorism.
In the wake of an unfathomable, barbarous act of
terror against a civilian population made up of citizens
from nations around the globe, we gather together in
unprecedented unity. We are united in our sorrow over
the losses arising from 11 September — the loss of
lives, the loss of friends and loved ones, the loss of
livelihoods and the loss of innocence, for want of a
better word. We are united in our condemnation of the
horrific acts perpetrated by an isolated group of
extremists who have no respect for human life. We are
united in our resolve that those responsible for the
atrocities of 11 September, and those who support
them, are a cancer in the body of nations — a systemic
blight which extends beyond the individual
perpetrators and which must be utterly eradicated, lest
it return and spread.
At the same time, we are united in our conviction
that their evil cannot be allowed to force us to abandon
respect for human rights and adherence to the rule of
law, which are fundamental principles of this
Organization. We are united in our recognition that, for
all their claims to holiness, those responsible for these
criminal acts of terror bear no legitimate claim to any
civilized religion and certainly do not represent the
noble and honourable beliefs of Islam. We are united in
our understanding that the peoples of Afghanistan are
also victims of the corruption and ill-fated control of
their Government by these criminals and their
supporters, as well as in our desire to assist in
improving the quality of life of the people of
Afghanistan. In all these things and more, we are
united to a degree that would have been unthinkable
before 11 September.

This new spirit of cooperation reflects the most
positive feature of globalization — the feature which
pro-globalization factions do not often put forward and
anti-globalization forces never consider. It is the only
feature of globalization that Pacific island countries
such as Palau can see as being truly and inherently
positive — a feature that the Pacific island countries
have recognized among themselves for decades. That
feature is the acknowledgement that, ultimately, there
is only one system in which we exist, and the related
understanding that any act or condition within that
system affects each of us, although in varying ways and
degrees. In such a system, problems are best addressed
through coalition-building and a consensus-driven
approach, a process of give and take, involving the
widest possible range of participants. We see proof of
this as the world continues to cooperate in responding
to the 11 September attacks against humanity.
As I have said, in this new spirit of cooperation,
the process of decision-making and the implementation
of those decisions must be as open and participatory as
possible. This is especially true in the light of the need
to weave together military, financial, law enforcement,
trade, intelligence-gathering and foreign aid issues. In
these troubled times, it simply makes no sense to
isolate a proven ally in the fight against terrorism. Yet
that is what is happening. The Republic of China on
Taiwan, which could and should be a very valuable
asset in these and other cooperative actions, is
significantly restricted in the role it can play because it
has been barred from membership in this body. In fact,
it is the only nation in the world which has no voice in
this Organization.
Not only is the exclusion of Taiwan contrary to
the fundamental, inclusive principles of the United
Nations, but on a more pragmatic level it compromises
security in Asia and the Pacific. Lacking a neutral
forum for the non-violent, diplomatic resolution of any
disputes it might have with the People’s Republic of
China, the Republic of China on Taiwan is at a great
disadvantage in maintaining stable and peaceful
relations in the region. It is simply counterproductive,
from either a practical or a political viewpoint, to
exclude from this body a peaceful, democratically
governed, economically vibrant nation which embraces
human rights and plays a major role in other
international organizations.
Similarly, it makes no sense, in this new global
system, to ignore an entire bloc of nations because of
perceptions left over from an earlier, colonial-era
world. Yet the Pacific island countries are still being
marginalized in the various United Nations bodies and
processes. It is time to recognize that the Pacific island
countries are unique entities, island countries with
distinct traditions, cultures, needs, interests and
concerns and are not merely the leftovers of
colonialism. It is time to recognize that they are among
the youngest nations of the world, with special
requirements for assistance in assuming their proper
place in the global arena. Those needs, interests and
concerns are often overlooked against the larger
backdrop of the Asia-Pacific Group in the United
Nations. It is time to change that; to deal more fully
with the Pacific island countries as such, rather than as
an afterthought tagged onto Asia.
Resolutions have been put forward which could
correct the erroneous exclusion of the Republic of
China on Taiwan, pave the way to providing a properly
expanded role for the Pacific island countries as such,
and produce greater cooperation and broader support in
all the key works of the United Nations. Now is the
time for the membership to adopt those resolutions in
recognition of the need for full participation of all
peoples in the global events unfolding now and sure to
develop in the foreseeable future.
Moreover, it is equally important in this new
globalization and world order that the most important
organ of the United Nations, the Security Council, be
reorganized and restructured to reflect true
representation of this Organization. While we
commend and applaud the five permanent members of
the Security Council for their efforts and contributions
to world peace and security, the time has come for this
body to consider the inclusion of several Member
States as permanent members of the Security Council.
Japan, among few others, has certainly reached the
level and capacity to be one of the permanent members
of the Security Council. In this respect, we applaud the
recent decision of the Japanese Government to send
support forces to the United States-led coalition war
against international terrorism.
Finally, if it can be said that any good came from
the abominations of 11 September, it would be this:
countries of the world that gave little thought to
engagement and cooperation in a larger, global system
are now fully engaged and working side by side with
countries to which they were formerly antagonistic or
to which they gave only passing thought, at best. This
3

new perspective can and should be applied to respond
to another global attack, one that is even more basic
than terrorism and will remain a threat to humanity
after the criminals of 11 September are brought to
justice.
This threat arises from the attack on our own
ecosystem through desertification, through the
reduction in global biodiversity and through global
warming and sea-level rise, all resulting from human
activities. These attacks, infinitely less dramatic than
those of 11 September, are nonetheless equally
systemic in nature and equally threatening to us all. It
is time to apply the same new understanding of global
dynamics, so forcefully driven home on 11 September,
to our environment.
We applaud and are very much encouraged by the
developments of the recently concluded seventh
session of the Conference of the Parties to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in
Morocco. To that end, I want to repeat my oft-stated
call for all nations to finalize negotiations on, sign,
ratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol as soon as
possible. Just as we must now directly confront the
effects of transnational acts of terror, we must now
directly confront the environmental consequences of
our own actions. Delay on either matter is unacceptable
and will only further compromise our well-being.
For perhaps the first time in its glorious history,
the phrase “United Nations” literally describes this
Organization. While we remain shocked, saddened and
deeply offended by the events giving rise to the new
unity, we must acknowledge and nurture whatever
good those events can be turned to. We now have the
ability to see the clear advantages of close cooperation
on matters which affect us all. Let us use the
knowledge, that wisdom gained from pain, and forge
even stronger, institutional reliance on cooperation,
consensus and coalition-building across the widest
possible constituency as we go forward in this new
global system.






"
7417,56,2001,AUS,"﻿Sir, let me begin, like
others, by congratulating you on having been elected
President of the fifty-sixth session of the General
Assembly. Let me also very warmly commend you on
your commitment to making the most efficient use of
the Assembly’s time, including — if I may say — by
beginning meetings punctually. I also want to join other
speakers in congratulating the Secretary-General, Kofi
Annan, and the United Nations more generally on their
heartily deserved receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.
The terrorist attacks of 11 September in
Washington, D.C., and here in New York City were not
just attacks on the United States. Australia, along with
more than 80 other nations, lost innocent civilians. We
are united in our grief for the victims and their
families. Australia condemns these attacks and
reaffirms unequivocally that terrorism is never justified
and must never be tolerated.
Australia has joined the international coalition
against terrorism. We have invoked our mutual security
pact for the first time with the United States, and we
are contributing military forces to the campaign against
those responsible for the 11 September attacks.
The international community is obliged to close
ranks against terrorism. We must starve terrorists of
their support — financial, political and moral. We must
deny terrorists safe haven. We must bring terrorists to
account.
Australia commends Security Council resolution
1373 (2001) of 28 September, which targets
comprehensively the terrorist menace. We will work
closely with the Committee on Counter-Terrorism of
the Security Council.
Australia has introduced new measures to prevent
and suppress the financing of terrorism and is already
party to all but one of the 12 international counter-
terrorism instruments.
A comprehensive convention against terrorism is
potentially a very important symbol of global
commitment on this issue. As the Assembly is aware,
Australia has taken a leading role in the negotiations,
reflecting our strong commitment to strengthening the
international legal framework. While we are
encouraged by the progress this past month, we join the
Secretary-General in urging the parties to conclude the
convention without delay.
The events of 11 September underline how
important it is that we maintain and strengthen
international non-proliferation regimes governing
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. If we want
to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles and
associated technology — and if we want to strengthen
mechanisms relating to conventional weapons — then
we also need a stronger commitment to other arms
control and disarmament instruments as well.
Let me turn now to East Timor. We all have a
deep interest in a stable, secure, viable and democratic
East Timor. East Timor is no longer an emergency, but,
instead, an emerging nation.
However, much more needs to be done. East
Timor remains vulnerable, and the role of the United
Nations is not complete. We need, after independence,
an integrated United Nations mission of civilians,
police and peacekeepers, under a single Security
4

Council mandate funded from United Nations assessed
contributions.
Australia therefore welcomes the Security
Council President’s statement of 31 October endorsing
the Secretary-General’s recommendations for a United
Nations successor mission in East Timor. We look
forward to working with others over the coming
months to set a solid and sensible mandate for a
successor mission.
Cooperative relations between East Timor and
Indonesia are key to East Timor’s longer-term security
and to that of the region as a whole. We very much
welcome steps by both sides to resolve outstanding
issues.
We welcome progress by the Indonesian
Government to resolve the situation in refugee camps
in West Timor, and we urge continued efforts to ensure
security and to facilitate the safe return of refugees.
Justice and reconciliation are important to East
Timor’s longer-term stability and prosperity. Australia
welcomes steps by President Megawati Soekarnoputri
to expand the jurisdiction of the ad hoc human rights
court and her Government’s commitment to bring to
justice those who have perpetrated human rights crimes
in East Timor. That commitment was reconfirmed in a
most welcome way in the Assembly yesterday by the
Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Hassan Wirajuda.
Australia will continue to support East Timor
generously. We have an agreement to share resources
from the Timor Sea. We are helping to reduce poverty
in East Timor and we are building East Timorese
capacity to govern peacefully and democratically. We
urge others to support East Timor. This is our chance,
collectively in the international community, to ensure
that the United Nations historic mission in East Timor
is remembered as a success.
Let me talk about what we in Australia call
“people-smuggling”. Australia has a proud history as a
major country of migration. We are, as a result of over
a century of planned and managed legal migration, a
tolerant multicultural society. We will continue as a
country of migration and we will continue to take more
than our fair share of refugees.
Regrettably, Australia is also increasingly a
favoured target for illegal migration, assisted by
individuals and criminal syndicates engaged in the
pernicious crime of people-smuggling. Many other
countries — as either transit or destination countries —
are also affected by this problem. As with other
transnational crimes, combating the phenomenon of
people-smuggling requires not just national, but also
concerted regional and multilateral action.
People-smugglers are primarily organized crime
syndicates. They exploit their victims. They find their
clients among people who have experienced conflict or
persecution, economic downturn or extreme
environmental breakdown. They target those desperate
for a better life. The loss recently of more than 350
lives, when a people-smuggling boat headed for
Australia sank, is a tragic reminder of the human costs
involved and of the callousness of people-smugglers.
Irregular migration, facilitated by people-
smuggling, undermines the integrity of the
international protection system. All countries share an
interest in protecting and strengthening the
international protection system. To do so, we must
tackle the problem of people-smuggling. A year ago, at
the Millennium Summit, leaders committed us to fight
people-smuggling and other transnational crimes. We
should redouble our efforts to do so. We need
coordinated, comprehensive approaches and concerted
international action to address all its aspects. Root
causes in source countries need to be addressed. The
humanitarian and other needs of displaced persons in
countries of first asylum need to be addressed. Transit
countries and countries of destination need to
cooperate more effectively.
Australia is working closely with its neighbours
in the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen our capacity to
prevent and deter people-smuggling and to bring
perpetrators to justice. This will continue to be a high
priority for my Government. We will also continue to
contribute to broader international efforts to deal with
the causes of irregular migration. These efforts, which
have the protection needs of refugees at their core, will
continue while we work with others in our region and
internationally to combat illegal migration and people-
smuggling.
Afghans fleeing the devastation of their homeland
pose a particular challenge to the international
community. A renewed focus and a more coordinated
response are needed. Australia supports the efforts of
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees and those of the countries of first asylum
to protect refugees in South-West Asia. We have
5

advocated, consistently and strongly, a comprehensive
response to the Afghan situation and substantially
increased our assistance to displaced and vulnerable
Afghans in South-West Asia.
The international community faces grave new
challenges that threaten global peace and prosperity. At
the same time, as the Secretary-General said in his
statement, the challenges that faced us before 11
September — poverty, disease, development — have
not diminished. The need for international cooperation
has never been greater. It is therefore tremendously
important that agreement was reached in Doha to
launch the development round of world trade
liberalization. Free trade, including in agriculture,
offers benefits for all countries and is crucial for
developing countries to overcome poverty.
Finally, I want to say that Australia stands ready
to support international efforts to combat international
terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction. Australia stands ready to ensure that recent
United Nations successes — such as in East Timor —
help create vibrant and sustainable democracies in
which people can be assured of their future and that of
their children. Australia stands ready to contribute to
sustained international action against people-smuggling
at source, in transit and at destination. Australia urges
that this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly
makes substantial progress towards those same goals.








"
7439,56,2001,NZL,"﻿May I first express my
condolences to the families and friends of those who
died in this morning's air crash. This was a tragedy in a
city that has already seen more than its share of tragedy
in recent times.
We meet in New York at this session of the
General Assembly under the shadow of terrorist attacks
on this city just two months ago. We mourn the lives of
nearly 5,000 people from 79 countries who, having
done nothing to deserve that fate, died in the attack.
The scale, premeditation, coordination and indifference
to mass murder that characterize this attack represent a
new age of terrorism. It is a terrorism that appears to
set no limit to its consequences. Those responsible for
it foreshadow a willingness to use biological, chemical
and nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The
potentially catastrophic effects if they are able to carry
out that threat demand an urgent and comprehensive
response to pre-empt any such action.
We cannot allow the rule of terror to replace the
rule of law. We cannot tolerate the damage that
terrorism has already done to the global economy. We
cannot allow terror to threaten basic human rights to
life and security.
New Zealand welcomes the lead by the United
Nations in coordinating an effective and enduring
response to terrorism. Security Council resolution 1373
(2001), adopted unanimously, sets out a blueprint for
action which every Member State has an obligation to
implement. Its emphasis is on measures to close off
financial support and the provision of refuge for
terrorist groups in every country of the world.
International cooperation in imposing these measures
and bringing the terrorists to justice will, in the longer
term, lie at the heart of the campaign to defeat
terrorism.
Removing the immediate threat posed by
terrorists such as those in Al Qaeda and those who
harbour them will, however, require more than
resolutions. Time and again over the past three years,
the Security Council has called on the Taliban to
prevent the use of Afghanistan by terrorists to launch
strikes against other countries. Those resolutions and
the sanctions that accompanied them have been ignored
by the Taliban. Where groups operate beyond the rule
of law and countries put themselves outside of
international codes of behaviour, the use of force
becomes a necessary part of our response.
Multilateral action and cooperation on a wider
front are also necessary if we are to be successful in
removing the threat of terrorism on an ongoing and
lasting basis. Comprehensive action is needed to
minimize the threat of chemical, biological or nuclear
weapons falling into the hands of extremist groups. No
State should develop, test and hold weapons of this
nature. Such weapons are a threat to humanity. Their
use by States would destroy and otherwise harm
innocent human beings as certainly as did the actions
of the terrorist group that attacked New York.
Nations yet to sign and ratify the United Nations
Conventions on Chemical and Biological Weapons and
treaties to ban mines and inhumane weapons must do
so. Nations must equally commit themselves to the
elimination of nuclear weapons, the early entry into
force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,
and an immediate start to negotiations on a fissile
material cut-off treaty.
The attack of 11 September should also
encourage all nations to ratify the Rome Statute to
bring into effect the International Criminal Court as a
forum for pursuing action against those responsible for
crimes against humanity.
Suppression of terrorism must also involve action
to deal with its causes. States must consider whether
the suppression of dissident or minority groups rather
than allowing legitimate channels to voice dissent
leaves resort to force as the only option.
The events of 11 September should encourage all
countries and organizations, particularly those directly
involved, to renew efforts to find a just and peaceful
solution to the Middle East crisis. To achieve a
peaceful solution between Palestinians and Israelis
requires good will and flexibility on both sides. There
can be no double standards in how the principles of
15

human rights, freedom and social and economic
opportunity are applied to all peoples.
One consequence of the campaign against
terrorism has been to bring the world's attention to the
situation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan reminds us that
where a vacuum is created by the absence of legitimate
government and the rule of law, it will be filled by
extremist elements, criminal groups dealing in drug
trafficking and terrorist organizations, all of which can
operate with impunity.
The international community has for too long
been indifferent to the situation in Afghanistan and to
the long-standing refugee crisis that has resulted from
22 years of war, from famine and from Taliban
oppression. Pakistan and Iran have carried the burden
of 3.6 million refugees, while much of the world
showed concern only when a handful of those refugees
in desperation sought to enter other countries illegally.
Too little concern has been shown internationally to the
300,000 Afghan children who have died annually from
preventable causes. One in three children in refugee
camps die before they reach the age of five. The groups
now protesting against military intervention were silent
while this human catastrophe was unfolding over the
last few years.
Any loss of innocent life in conflict is tragic, and
extraordinary measures must be taken to avoid it. But a
failure to remove the Taliban regime and a failure to
assist the Afghan people to put in place a broad-based,
moderate and stable Government to replace the Taliban
will mean the ongoing loss of hundreds of thousands of
lives and the continued suffering of the Afghan people.
Renewed efforts are needed through United
Nations agencies to provide emergency relief to people
within Afghanistan and in the refugee camps to avoid
unnecessary loss of life through the winter and in the
months to come. The United Nations must stand ready
to assist Afghanistan to rebuild itself once the conflict
is over, working with as broad a coalition of Afghan
groups as is possible to create a viable political,
economic and social infrastructure.
Resolving the problems that have forced so many
millions of people from their homes is fundamental to
solving the growing refugee crisis. In Afghanistan and
elsewhere, people flee their homelands through fear of
death or persecution, or because of poverty and lack of
opportunity.
In a world made smaller by advances in
communication and transport, no State can ignore the
plight in other countries or expect not to face
consequences from unacceptable discrepancies in
wealth, opportunity and human rights standards.
Suppression of criminal organizations responsible
for people trafficking is a challenge which demands
increased international cooperation. Those who profit
from people's desperation and who, once paid, are
careless as to whether or not their human cargo
survives must be stamped out. However, removing the
causes of people fleeing from their countries remains
fundamental.
New Zealand's own region of the Pacific has not
been immune from violence and instability. In recent
years, we have seen conflict in East Timor, violence
between Government and separatist movements within
Indonesia and in Bougainville, ethnic conflict in the
Solomon Islands and a coup that overthrew a legitimate
Government in Fiji.
Problems remain in the region, but there have
been notable areas of improvement. A peace settlement
has been signed in Bougainville. Fiji has held
democratic elections. Indonesia is seeking to resolve
separatist conflict by offering greater autonomy. In
East Timor, there have been free elections, and that
country will gain independence as the first new nation
of the twenty-first century in May 2002. International
cooperation and a capable transitional administration
by the United Nations have achieved a remarkable
transformation in a poor and devastated country. I
congratulate the Security Council on its endorsement of
the Secretary-General's concept for a post-
independence United Nations presence in East Timor to
consolidate what has been achieved.
In acknowledging the role of United Nations
personnel, I would also stress the need to ensure their
proper protection in situations which are often
dangerous. The murder of United Nations relief
workers in Atambua, West Timor, and the failure to
bring to account those fully responsible are a reminder
that more must be done to protect our United Nations
personnel. We endorse the Secretary-General's
recommendations on extending the legal protection for
United Nations and other personnel involved in
humanitarian operations.
It is timely at this General Assembly to stress the
importance of the role of the United Nations. The
16

critical wars of the twenty-first century will not be won
by single nations, however powerful, or even by
coalitions. It is the United Nations acting collectively
which will win the wars against terrorism, poverty and
disease; threats to the environment; and the threats
posed by conflict and weapons of mass destruction.
The commitments made by heads of State and
Government in the United Nations Millennium
Declaration last year take on even greater relevance
following the events of 11 September.
However, for the United Nations to achieve its
potential, it must undergo reform. To prevent the
General Assembly and the Secretariat from becoming
overwhelmed by so many tasks that they fail to be
effective in tackling any of them, we need to prioritize
our agenda and to be more selective.
The Security Council needs reform. Its
membership should be expanded to reflect
contemporary realities, but without maintaining or
extending the veto. Countries contributing to
peacekeeping operations should be afforded greater
involvement in the Council's decision-making with
respect to those operations. Peacekeeping operations
must be sufficiently resourced.
The capacity of the United Nations for rapid
reaction must be strengthened. New Zealand is ready to
enter into discussions on a memorandum of
understanding with the United Nations on its
participation in the standby arrangements system. This
is consistent with New Zealand's long-standing
readiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations and
its current involvement in more than 12 such
operations, including its commitment since 1999 of a
battalion to help ensure the success of the United
Nations operation in East Timor.
The United Nations was founded after the Second
World War to build a world free from poverty, violence
and the violation of human rights. Nations committed
themselves to a collective response to problems that
could not be solved by countries individually.
Countries agreed on rules of international behaviour.
No one would claim that the United Nations has
an unblemished record of success. But without it, the
world would be a much less secure place, much less
able to confront the difficulties which we face. Let this
fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly reaffirm
our commitment to work collectively to defeat
terrorism, conflict, poverty and disease, and set the
agenda for peace, development and respect for human
rights for all.







"
7442,56,2001,VUT,"﻿At the outset, I wish to
extend to Mr. Han Seung-soo greetings from the
Government and the people of the Republic of
Vanuatu. I wish to convey to him the apologies of my
Government for not being able to be represented here
at the ministerial level owing to the fact that our
Parliament is currently in session. I should also like to
take this opportunity to convey my Government’s
congratulations to him on his election as President of
the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also
pay tribute to his predecessor, who so ably played a
decisive role at the helm of the fifty-fifth session.
In addition, allow me to congratulate the
Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to a
second term at the head of this esteemed world body.
His assured wisdom and compassion are needed now
more than ever to lead this Organization.
I have the great honour, in standing before the
Assembly today, to deliver a statement on behalf of my
Government and the people of the Republic of Vanuatu
at a time so sad that words cannot begin to convey the
scope of our emotions. Let me express the sincere
sympathy and condolences of my Government and the
people of Vanuatu to the families and friends of the
victims of the tragedy that struck downtown New York,
Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. In light of these
events, since the 11 September attacks, the General
Assembly has been forced to suspend most of its
35

agenda, including this general debate among heads of
State and Government.
It is ironic that as the world becomes more
civilized, we become more vulnerable to such inhuman
acts of terrorism. The impacts of these terrorist
activities are being felt around the globe, and small
States such as mine will suffer along with the rest of
the international community. If any good has come out
of the despicable events of 11 September, it is that
nations the world over are more united than ever in
condemning and collaborating to eradicate these
terrible acts of terrorism. My Government has taken
steps to tighten security and is working closely with
other Pacific island States towards building and
strengthening peace and security in our region.
Global peace and security cannot be certain in
this climate of continued difference of views between
major nuclear-weapon States. The lack of progress on
this is reflected by the stalemate prevailing in the
Conference on Disarmament. The agreements reached
during the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons were not realized; the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not entered into force; and
global military expenditures continue to rise. More
committed efforts and innovative strategies are needed
to meet the goals of the Millennium Declaration.
Vanuatu believes that the Conference on Disarmament
should work towards that end.
The Third United Nations Conference on the
Least Developed Countries, held in Brussels in May
this year, was highly successful and produced the
Brussels Declaration and the Programme of Action for
Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.
We appreciate the view of the Secretary-General that
the Declaration reaffirms the collective responsibility
of the international community to uphold the principles
of human dignity, equality and equity and to ensure
that globalization becomes a positive force for all the
world’s people. We believe that without the
coordinated involvement of the whole United Nations
system, there will be little the United Nations can
achieve.
The Government of Vanuatu, like other
Governments around the world, is committed to
enhancing the status of women. It is well documented
that women in Vanuatu are disadvantaged in almost all
sectors. In 1995, Vanuatu unanimously ratified the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women. Accordingly, the
Government of Vanuatu is focusing on the Convention
as the basis for programmes on women’s rights and
development in Vanuatu.
A lack of resources has hindered Vanuatu’s
progress in submitting its first two reports. The
Government, however, recognizes the importance of
the reports in terms of building up and monitoring its
own human resources development requirements and is
thus putting greater effort into the production of these
reports. Indeed, no country can afford to waste half of
its human resources.
Vanuatu remains steadfast in its commitments and
obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the
Child. Since ratifying the Convention in 1992, the
Government of Vanuatu has implemented decisions and
undertaken activities that promote the advancement of
children in our society. A National Children’s
Committee, whose membership is made up of
stakeholders, has been revived and is officially
recognized as the regulatory body for coordinating and
supervising children’s rights throughout the nation.
The electoral assistance provided by the United
Nations for Fiji’s national election has greatly
facilitated the democratic transition in that country. We
welcome the new focus on supporting institutions and
stimulating local participation. We also welcome other
efforts to deploy the Electoral Assistance Division to
coordinate the activities of foreign observers in
forthcoming elections, particularly in East Timor and
hopefully in Solomon Islands. We commend the United
Nations for its assistance in empowering the citizens of
Member States to enjoy the power of democracy.
We recognize the efforts of the United Nations in
bridging the gap between human rights norms and their
implementation. Despite some progress, challenges
remain in ensuring universal respect for human rights.
The Republic of Vanuatu is a party to nearly all core
human rights treaties. We feel there is a continuing
need for human and institutional capacity-building in
developing countries in order to ensure the
implementation of human rights conventions and
treaties they have signed. This is an area where the
United Nations should follow a needs-based approach
and make a realistic assessment of the existing
mechanisms.
36

The East Timorese people, who have already
elected their Constituent Assembly, will democratically
elect their President and soon exercise full sovereignty
over their entire territory; this positive development is
a big leap. It affirms the outstanding commitment of
the Committee of 24 in deliberating on the right of
peoples to self-determination. However, there are those
who are still waiting to exercise this right. At this
session’s general debate, I am pleased to note that the
report of the Secretary-General on the work of the
Organization gives special mention to West Papua. The
Secretary-General intends to enhance our efforts to
assist Indonesia in seeking to establish a democratic
society and in addressing the wide range of complex
issues facing that country. The Secretary-General also
underlined the efforts of the Indonesian authorities to
further the promotion of human rights and find
peaceful resolutions to the problems in West Papua,
Aceh and Maluku. During the thirty-second Pacific
Islands Forum in Nauru, Forum leaders expressed
continuing concern about violence and loss of life in
the Indonesian province of West Papua. The Forum
also called on the Indonesian authorities to ensure to
that the voices of all parties in West Papua be heard in
order to achieve a peaceful resolution. Our leaders
welcomed the recent presentation of special autonomy
proposals to Indonesia’s national assembly, while
urging all parties to protect and uphold the human
rights of all residents in West Papua.
I am extremely pleased to inform the Assembly
that the Government of Vanuatu has agreed to host the
Special Committee of 24 on decolonization seminar in
Port Vila, Vanuatu, in May of next year. We look
forward to that important meeting.
The Republic of Vanuatu wishes to join others in
expressing our appreciation to the Secretary-General
for his comprehensive report on the implementation of
the recommendations of the Special Committee on
Peacekeeping Operations and of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations. Vanuatu is a new supporter
of the United Nations peacekeeping role in East Timor
and Bosnia and has contributed civilian police to these
United Nations peacekeeping initiatives. The Vanuatu
Government remains committed to future peacekeeping
engagements. Vanuatu has also monitored the
Bougainville peace process alongside the United
Nations.
One of the more pressing issues before us is that
of climate change and sea-level rise. The United
Nations has now scheduled a World Summit on
Sustainable Development, to be held in Johannesburg,
South Africa, in September of next year.
The Pacific Islands Forum communiqué reflected
on climate change in seeking the international
community’s awareness of our low-lying islands in the
Pacific and reiterating the priority of the Kyoto
Protocol as a significant step forward for global action
in combating climate change. Although signed by
many of the industrialized countries, including the
United States, the Kyoto Protocol has not yet been
ratified by many of them. We are very concerned that
the United States Senate has actually voted against
ratification.
Our Forum leaders noted the concerns expressed
by most members over the United States intention not
to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. We urge the United States
to reconsider its position and to ratify the Kyoto
Protocol as soon as possible.
While the incidence of HIV/AIDS is not as high
in the Pacific as in some other regions, it is
nevertheless a major issue for both developing and
developed countries within our region. Vanuatu’s
delegation is of the firm view that prevention should be
the mainstay of combating HIV/AIDS in our region.
The relatively low number of reported HIV/AIDS
cases in a number of our countries should not give rise
to complacency. Once the disease takes hold, care and
treatment can be extremely expensive. In this respect,
Vanuatu welcomes the establishment of a Global Fund
to combat HIV/AIDS, and we wish to express our
appreciation to those Governments, foundations and
private companies that have already expressed support.
Meanwhile, strategies and plans for resource
mobilization must keep in mind the competing
priorities of, and the constraints faced by, smaller
States like Vanuatu.
In conclusion, the Vanuatu delegation reaffirms
its support and conviction for the crucial role that the
United Nations has in ensuring that the world becomes
a much safer place in which to live.


"
7469,56,2001,PNG,"﻿On behalf of
the people and Government of Papua New Guinea, I
wish to join previous speakers in congratulating the
President on his election to this prestigious post.
His election shows the high esteem in which the
international community holds both him personally and
his country, the Republic of Korea.
My delegation is confident that, through his great
diplomatic skills and leadership, which is already
evident, he will continue to guide the work of this
session of the General Assembly to its successful
conclusion.
I also take this opportunity, through him, to
express my delegation’s sincere appreciation to his
predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his
outstanding leadership and stewardship in facilitating
the work of the historic Millennium Summit and the
fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.
We also congratulate and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi
Annan for his re-election to the office of Secretary-
General of the United Nations and for the award of the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Papua New Guinea is resolute in its commitment
to the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter. Papua New Guinea acknowledges the value of
many of the United Nations treaties and declarations,
including those that advance human rights, the rule of
law and good governance. Many of these principles are
enumerated in our national Constitution.
We acknowledge that the Organization has had
some limitations, many of which are self-inflicted. We
note that the United Nations is now in a much healthier
31

financial position than ever before. However, there is
no room for complacency in the pursuit of its reform
programme. The United Nations bodies and systems
must be restructured to reflect new dynamics and
geopolitical changes and to create hope for all at the
beginning of the new millennium.
We believe that our common global and regional
problems cannot be resolved under the auspices of
violence, terrorism, war and destruction; nor can they
be resolved in a vacuum. The United Nations provides
a forum and an avenue for fostering dialogue for
peaceful resolution of disputes.
An effective Security Council, we believe, should
be representative of all subregions of the world. My
Government also believes that the use of the veto
power should be limited to Chapter VII issues, while
the working methods and deliberations of the Council
should be more transparent and democratic.
Papua New Guinea’s development aspirations
have been compromised by problems associated with
the downturn in the global economy, the economic
crisis within the Asia-Pacific region and natural
disasters, over all of which we have little control. The
Government has addressed these challenges through a
comprehensive programme of structural adjustments.
We have worked hard to make sure that these structural
adjustments are made in the public sector in order to
stimulate and expand growth in the private sector.
The measures we have adopted have stabilized
the economy. However, as we look into the future, we
cannot but hope that the incidents of 11 September will
not unduly affect our future recovery. Judging by the
evidence of a downturn in the United States economy,
it seems clear that every effort is required to make the
International Conference on Financing for
Development next year a success.
We are grateful to the Friends of Papua New
Guinea group, comprising Australia, Japan, the
European Commission and China, among others, which
have been generous in assisting our Government in its
development efforts. The World Bank, International
Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank have
also been very positive in their responses to our
policies.
My country has experienced an unfortunate and
terrible conflict and has been trying to build mutual
confidence and security by pursuing a progressive
political settlement, including through restoration and
development for the past four years in its Bougainville
Province. We have utilized the Melanesian way of
building consensus between all parties to the conflict.
The consensus is now reflected in the Bougainville
Peace Agreement, signed by the parties on 30 August
this year. The Government is resolute in its desire to
implement the Agreement. It has completed work on
drafting amendments to our Constitution to provide for
greater autonomy, a referendum and amnesty. Together
with ongoing efforts to implement other aspects of the
Agreement, the parties are expected to facilitate
progress on weapons disposal and associated issues,
such as reconciliation and the unification of political
and administrative structures in Bougainville. A special
session of Parliament will be been convened next
week, on 22 November, to continue to debate the
Agreement. Parliament will deliberate on the
constitutional amendments on or soon after 14
December this year.
We wish to place on record our deep appreciation
to the United Nations, in particular Ambassador Noel
Sinclair and his team on Bougainville, the United
Nations Development Programme, the European
Union, individual European Union members and the
Governments of Australia, Fiji, Japan, New Zealand,
Solomon Islands and Vanuatu for their continuing and
constructive roles in Bougainville.
It is also my pleasure to speak on behalf of the
Bougainville parties and the Government to thank the
Secretary-General and all members of the Security
Council, past and present, for continuing to renew the
mandate of the United Nations Political Office in
Bougainville. We are confident that the Security
Council will continue to provide all the assistance we
need with respect to arms collection, storage and
disposal.
The process of decolonization will not be
completed until the people of the remaining 17 Non-
Self-Governing Territories have exercised their right to
self-determination and/or achieved self-government.
Papua New Guinea welcomes the cooperation of
the Government of France with regard to the progress
made in implementing the Nouméa Accords and setting
in motion the eventual exercise of the right of self-
determination by the people of New Caledonia,
especially the indigenous Kanak people.
32

We acknowledge the full cooperation of the
Government of New Zealand in the progress made so
far with respect to the question of the Tokelau Islands.
My Government notes the progress made in East
Timor. We heartily welcome the announcement of 20
May 2002 as the day the people of East Timor will
attain independence and nationhood. We look forward
to welcoming them as a full Member of this family of
nations.
Papua New Guinea continues to urge the other
administering Powers to cooperate with the Special
Political and Decolonization Committee in
implementing and completing its mandate soon.
The future of each of the remaining Non-Self-
Governing Territories can be assured only by a
positive, constructive and, above all, transparent
approach to developing a unique solution for each of
them.
The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly
established the Consultative Process on oceans to
improve the coordination and management of the
programmes associated with the use, development and
protection of the oceans and seas. The Consultative
Process has been successful in bringing to the fore, and
focusing the attention of Member States on, a number
of issues.
The Pacific Islands Forum group includes small
island developing States that are custodians of the
largest ocean space. This ocean space is rich in natural
and marine resources. However, the small island
developing States of the region have limited human,
financial and technological capacities to harvest,
control, manage and secure these resources for the
benefit of our current and future generations.
It has been said that to divert the poor from the
call of the evil, it is not enough to appeal to their
stomachs only. Rather, one must appeal to their
aspirations as well. We joined others having particular
interest in the sustainable use and management of the
fish stocks in our region to establish the Convention on
the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory
Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean
in September 2000. The next meeting of the signatories
to this Convention will be held in Papua New Guinea
early next year.
We welcome Malta’s lodgement last Sunday of its
instrument of ratification of the Agreement for the
Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December
1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of
Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish
Stocks. The Agreement, which will now come into
force on 11 December 2001, called on States to
cooperate to enhance the ability of developing States,
in particular the least developed and small island
developing States, to conserve and develop their own
fisheries for such stocks. For all small island
developing States in the Pacific, financing for
development has to be linked to the development of
their fisheries sector.
In order to emphasize my point, I have provided
some data on the last page of my written statement.
The Assembly will note that the Central and Western
Pacific fishery is valued in excess of $2.5 billion per
annum, while the Pacific small island developing
States earn an average of only $66 million per annum
in licensing fees. For the small island developing States
of the Pacific to attain sustainable growth and
development, this situation has to change.
Last year my delegation also welcomed the
conclusion by the International Seabed Authority of the
exploration code for seabed mining. Continuing work
is to be undertaken with respect to a code for
exploration for polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich
crusts. Papua New Guinea has particular interest in
polymetallic sulfides.
My delegation would like to thank once again the
Secretary-General of the International Seabed
Authority, Ambassador Satya Nandan, for his report on
the work of the Authority. We welcome the execution
of contracts by pioneer investors and urge the
remaining pioneer investor to follow suit as soon as
possible.
Papua New Guinea supports the principles
contained in the Barbados Programme of Action and in
Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development. We continue to support
the principles contained in the Kyoto Protocol and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. We once again stress the urgent need for
developed countries to make a concerted effort to
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
My delegation welcomes the achievements of part
two of the sixth session of the Conference of the
Parties to the climate change Convention, held at Bonn
33

last July, and the successful completion of the recent
seventh session of the Conference, held at Marrakesh,
Morocco.
Another of the greatest challenges facing the
United Nations is to strengthen the capacity of the
global community to respond promptly and effectively
to climate change and natural disaster. In 1997, Papua
New Guinea experienced drought and frost caused by
El Niño and in 1998 came the tsunami and the La Niña
phenomenon, bringing floods and landslides and
leaving death and destruction in their wake. We
acknowledge the prompt and generous support of our
neighbours in dealing with the effects of such disasters.
Global warming has also brought increased numbers of
cases of diseases such as malaria to the higher-altitude
and most populous region of our country. The threat of
increased incidence of malaria in that region is real,
and could negatively affect the demographics of the
country. There is definitely a link among climate
change, natural disaster and the spread and increased
incidence of disease.
Nor is Papua New Guinea exempt from the HIV/
AIDS epidemic or from tuberculosis. We are grateful to
Australia and to other partners which have provided
assistance in that field of health care. We also welcome
again last year’s announcement by the Japanese
Government that it would set aside substantial financial
resources for disease eradication programmes in
developing countries.
The forthcoming International Conference on
Financing for Development and the World Summit for
Sustainable Development must be platforms for
launching new and innovative methods for realigning
the policies of the Bretton Woods institutions so that
they focus more on development and on the eradication
of poverty. There must be a concerted effort to link
new and innovative financial instruments to the
delivery of specific outcome-oriented approaches.
There must be flexibility in assisting developing
countries, especially small island, landlocked and least
developed countries. As I have said before, for the
peoples of the Pacific islands to become meaningful
participants in the globalization process, new financial
instruments and mechanisms should be developed to
facilitate the transfer of technological capacity and
expertise in the fisheries sector.
Papua New Guinea is committed to peaceful
dialogue among nations and condemns those that
employ terrorism against people or that finance, recruit
or train terrorists or mercenaries. The barbaric acts of
11 September have been described in many ways.
Some have called them horrendous, despicable and the
work of evil-doers. The use of any adjective to describe
the horror and the continuing threat to human security
only adds to the esteem in which some hold the
perpetrators. The use of qualifiers to describe the
innocence of the deceased lends legitimacy to those
acts and shields the nakedness of their wilful and
wrongful nature.
Papua New Guinea condemns the 11 September
attacks on the United States and supports the ongoing
campaign by the United States and its allies against
terrorism. On behalf of the Government and the people
of Papua New Guinea, I convey our heartfelt
condolences to the immediate families and other
relatives of all those who had their lives brutally taken
away from them in New York, Washington, D.C., and
Pennsylvania. My Government is committed to
implementing Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)
and is in the process of examining all existing
conventions relating to terrorism with a view to
acceding to them early next year.
Papua New Guinea also notes the death several
days ago of the political leader of the people of the
Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, Mr. Theys Eluay,
under questionable circumstances. As a neighbouring
country which shares a common border with that
province, Papua New Guinea is concerned about the
likely spillover effect of new developments in the
province. We urge Indonesia to undertake a thorough,
impartial and transparent investigation into Mr. Eluay’s
death, to make public the results and to bring to justice
those responsible.
My Government is committed to a stable,
peaceful and environmentally safe world and therefore
supports the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-
Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. We call on all
that have nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass
destruction, including biological weapons, to stop
testing, manufacturing and storing them, and
furthermore to take steps to destroy them.
We also support efforts to ban transboundary
movements of radioactive and other hazardous wastes
through the Pacific region. We call on those States that
previously conducted nuclear-weapon tests or that have
34

discharged chemical or other non-degradable wastes in
our subregion to adequately compensate and provide
appropriate medical assistance to the scores of persons
and families affected. Remedial action should be taken
to clean up the damage done to the environment.
Global and regional partnerships to promote
change are the key to addressing the challenges that the
world will face in the twenty-first century. Papua New
Guinea believes that a challenge for Member States is
to reshape the Organization so that it can serve as an
effective tool for implementing our collective desire: to
make the global village a better place for all.
