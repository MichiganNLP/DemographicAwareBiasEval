This megathread is meant for discussion of the current **Russo-Ukrainian War**, also known as the **Russian invasion of Ukraine**. Please read our [current rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules), but also the extended rules below.

# News sources:

- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance)

- [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine).

- [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60525350)

You can also get up-to-date information and news from the [r/worldnews live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs), which are more up-to-date tweets about the situation.

### **Current rules extension:**
 
Extended [r/europe ruleset](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules) to curb hate speech and disinformation:

- While we already ban hate speech, we'll remind you that hate speech against the civilians of the combatants is against our rules, including but not limited to Ukrainians, **Russians**, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc. The same applies to the population of countries actively helping Ukraine or Russia.

- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply. 

- **No unverified reports of any kind in the comments or in submissions on r/europe**. We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.

- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.

- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.

### Submission rules

These are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.
	
- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. ""City X still holding"" would not be allowed, ""Russia takes major city"" would be allowed. ""Major attack on Kherson repelled"" would also be allowed.)

- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.
  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.
    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.
- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them. If your link has been removed, please notify the moderation team, explaining who's the person managing that substack page.
- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.
- No promotion of a new cryptocurrency or web3 project, other than the official Bitcoin and ETH addresses from Ukraine's government.

# Please obey the request of the Ukrainian government to [refrain from sharing info about Ukrainian troop movements](https://i.redd.it/5atggucaurj81.jpg)",War in Ukraine Megathread LVI (57),Europe
1,"r/europe is the prime subreddit to share and discuss anything related to Europe, from news to data and pictures. Due to the size and complexity of the topics this subreddit covers, new rules aren't introduced that easily here.

Since Hamas' attacks on Israel back in October, we've seen a flush of users that were not previously active participants in our subreddit, and also encouraged a lot of hate speech previously unseen here. As moderators, we read the same arguments in favor of each side repeatedly since the war broke out again in the region.

We know that the Palestine Question is one of the most heated discussions on the Internet, and also one that influences the political lives of many, both inside Israel or Palestine, and outside of it. However, we've seen that users rarely maintain civility, and moderators are not able to properly maintain civil discourse compared to other topics.

That said:

* Until said otherwise, **any** post related to Israel, Palestine, and the war in the region will be **removed**. Insistence on posting such content will be met with warnings and bans if necessary.

* News of extraordinary importance not only to Europe - **which must be related** - but to the whole world can still be shared. Our criteria will be how many websites, from news agency (AP, Reuters) to international newspapers (Euronews, NYT, France24, and others), share **original reporting** on it. That means that initial reporting on the outbreak of the war would be allowed, but Eurovision-related news won't, for example.

425,"Russian forces are reaping the benefits of the West's long-term restriction on Ukraine using Western-provided weapons to strike legitimate military targets on Russian territory — territory that Russian forces now depend on to sustain their offensive operations in northern Kharkiv Oblast. Western officials have prohibited Ukraine from using Western-supplied weapons to strike targets on Russian territory, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stated their adherence to this condition.[30] UK Foreign Minister David Cameron only recently greenlit Ukrainian forces to use UK-provided weapons to strike targets in Russian territory, but this is insufficient for Ukraine's interdiction needs in Russian territory and came too late to allow Ukrainian forces to inhibit Russia's ability to concentrate forces along the international border.[31] Ukrainian forces have previously used US-provided HIMARS to devastating effect, particularly in forcing Russian forces to withdraw from the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast in November 2022 and continue to use HIMARS and other US- and Western-provided weapons to strike Russian force concentrations in rear and deep rear areas in occupied Ukraine.[32] Ukrainian forces regularly conduct drone strikes against infrastructure and airfields in Russia, but these lack the same interdiction effects that Ukrainian forces now need to generate to undermine the Russian offensive operations.[33]   Ukrainian forces would greatly benefit from being able to use advanced long-range weapons systems to disrupt Russian logistics nodes and routes that are currently supplying the Kharkiv offensive but must instead rely on their limited and depleted stock of indigenous weapons.

Kremlin information operations encouraging Western self-deterrence likely aimed to allow Russian forces to build up and launch offensive operations without the threat of Ukrainian strikes against military and logistics assets.
