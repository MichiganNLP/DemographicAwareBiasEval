It has long been known in African, Asian and black American spaces that reddit, a predominantly western and suburban white platform, is a disenfranchising experience. Were any mention of the inherit uncomfortable nature of said thing results in either liberal racism or bad faith arguments dismissing it.

A trivial example of this is how hip hop spaces (\*) were the love of the genre only extend to the superficial as long as the exploitative context of its inception and its deep ties to black culture are not mentioned. Take the subreddit r/hiphop101. See the comments on . Where it is OK by u/GoldenAgeGamer72 (no, don't @ me) to miss the point and trivialize something eminem agreed, [but not OK for the black person to clarify in a space made by them for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphop101/comments/1ceonof/comment/l1oaspx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

The irony of said spaces is that it normalizes the same condescending and denigrating dismissal that hurt the people that make the genre in the first place. Making it a veritable minstrel show were approval extends only to the superficial entertainment.

When the cause is still around, a symptom cannot be antiquated.

*note: Never going to stop being funny when some of these people listen to conscious rap not knowingly that they are the people it is about.*

This example might seem stupid, and seem not relevant to an African sub, but it leads to a phenomenon  were African and Asian spaces bury themselves to avoid disenfranchisement. Leading to fractured and toxic communities. Which leads me to:

# Black Diaspora Discussion

The point is to experiment with a variant of the ""African Discussion"" but with the addition of black diaspora. With a few ground rules:

* **Many submissions will be removed:** As to not have the same problem as r/askanafrican, were western egocentric questions about ""culture appropriation"" or "" what do you think about us"". Have a bit of cultural self-awareness.
* **This is an African sub, first and foremost:** Topics that fail to keep that in mind or go against this reality will be removed without notice. This is an African space, respect it.
* Black Diaspora flair require mandatory verification: Unlike African flairs that are mostly given based on long time comment activity. Black Diaspora flair will require mandatory verification. As to avoid this place becoming another minstrel show.
* **Do not make me regret this:** There is a reason I had to alter rule 7 as to curb the Hoteps and the likes. Many of you need to accept you are not African and have no relevant experience. Which is OK. It is important we do not overstep ourselves and respects each others boundaries if we want solidarity
* **"" Well, what about-..."":** What about you? What do we own you that we have to bow down to your entitlement? You know who you are.

**To the Africans who think this doesn't concern them:** This subreddit used to be the same thing before I took over. If it happens to black diasporans in the west, best believe it will happen to you.

4,"The Osagyefo Dr K. Nkrumah saw progress and prosperity in Africa only  in terms of the OAU, now the Africa Union. He envisioned this union as the only way that African could achieve political stability and economic independence.

Later events provide evidence that he was spot on. Why?

1. Africa is plagued  by corruption and neocolonialist exploitation. Imagine Africa were like the US which has a central Federal government. It would have been impossible for individual leaders to rise to power trample on the constitution and visit terror on its citizen because the authority of the Africans union and the Central military would have dealt with them. There would have been a recognisable authority to have dealt with, Idi Amin, Mengistu, Bokassa, Doe, Houphoet Boigny, Mobutu, The Rwanda atrocities, Somalia , etc. We would have enjoyed safety by way of numbers.

2. Africa  has lots of natural resources and economic capability. Imagine if Africans traded fairly amongst ourselves with a common African currency. We would not have had individual states like UK, France, Belguim signing contracts with individual leaders and robbing us.  And if all the oil sold in Africa had been properly accounted for, not to talk about the dozens of minerals. What a great continent that would have been. 

3. The apartheid ssytem dreaded a United Africa. They would have been thrown out of Zimbabwe, ans South Africa, ages earlier.

I wish anyone cleverer than I,  to spell out how Africa, or any African country can get better on its own. Even if by a miracle one country became rich or technologically advanced, it will be swamped by migration from all the less of countries until they expel them as has happened so many times.

5,"Recently, I traveled from Cameroon 🇨🇲 to Uganda 🇺🇬 and then to Rwanda 🇷🇼. I noticed significant differences in internet prices across these countries. 

In Cameroon 🇨🇲, we had an ISP called Blue by Camtel. It wasn't very fast, but the plans were affordable. For example, I used to buy an unlimited plan for 3,000 CFA (approximately $6) for 30 days. It wasn't fast, but I could watch Netflix shows, low-quality YouTube videos, and use Spotify.

When I arrived in Uganda 🇺🇬, the prices were much higher. I used an Airtel plan that cost 30,000 UGX (approximately $8) for 12 GB, which last 30 days. I found myself depleting it in just a few days because I was used to the unlimited plan in Cameroon.

In Rwanda 🇷🇼, I was even more surprised. I got an Airtel plan for 5,000 RWF (approximately $4), which gave me 2 GB per day at maximum speed, with unlimited calls and SMS to all local networks for 30 days that’s 60Gb per month for $4.

I keep asking myself, what affects internet prices? Why is it expensive in some countries and affordable in others? Can somebody explain this to me?

The Washington calendar is filled with get-togethers for the diplomatic set, from embassy parties to book launches to private dinners with policymakers. Each gathering is a chance to network, sometimes with very powerful people, or at least glean gossip from their underlings.

But in a city teeming with people determined to garner attention for their causes or constituencies, one group is largely absent from such conversations: African diplomats.. 

This is what African diplomats have to say:


African diplomats say they’d like to be more prominent in the U.S. capital, but that, above all, they lack the resources.

Many of their embassies have just a handful of diplomats. Those diplomats often are underpaid; some take side jobs in Washington such as Uber or delivery drivers, or even at gas stations, according to a current and a former State Department official familiar with the issue.

So when he received phone calls from his parents I occasionally heard him mention “Africa” several times in their conversations since I don’t know Arabic and that made me curious. 

Me: what was up with Africa? You mention it in every conversation with your parents ( cause it’s rare for someone to mention a whole continent in a conversation) 

Him: well, my parents want to know how I’m doing in Africa

Me: (🤔… loading… 😳…what?? Am I missing something?)
 
Why would you refer to Kenya as “Africa” and you come from the same exact continent? 


(Last time I checked, Egypt was in Africa. His response took me aback 😂🤣)


Him: well, Mt Sinai is outside Africa


(Since I didn’t know where it was exactly)


Me: so what? Wait, aren’t you guys taught about Africa? Do you guys think you’re not African? 


Him:  (confused) 


So, my question is.. what’s wrong with being “African “? Are you guys taught about Africa in your syllabus? 
If not , is there a reason why you’re not taught? If so, why do you distance yourself from the rest of Africa? Is it color? 

I understand that being African and being black are two different things. 

Or was he just acting ignorant? (I’m genuinely curious)

59,"Democracies can be unicameral or bicameral. With an unicameral system, there is only one chamber which uses some proportional system (usually) and represents the electorate as a whole.

With a bicameral system, there is a Lower Chamber (House of representatives, Congress of Deputies, National assembly, Parliament... it's called differently in every country) and a Higher Chamber (usually called ""Senate""). In most cases, the LC it's supposed to represent people while the HC works as a territorial representation chamber.

Both unicameral and bicameral legislative systems have their unique advantages:

**Unicameral System Advantages**:

&#x200B;

* **Efficiency in Lawmaking**: A unicameral system can pass laws more quickly and efficiently since there is only one legislative body to go through
* **Cost-Effectiveness**: Operating a single legislative chamber can be less costly compared to maintaining two separate chambers.
* **Simplicity**: The process and structure are simpler, which can make it easier for citizens to understand and engage with the legislative process.
* **Direct Representation**: It can offer a closer representation of the people’s will, as there are fewer barriers to enacting legislation that reflects the popular vote.

**Bicameral System Advantages**:

&#x200B;

* **Checks and Balances**: A bicameral system provides a system of checks and balances, which can prevent the passage of laws that benefit only special interests or specific groups.
* **Diverse Representation**: It allows for representation at multiple levels, such as local and national, which can ensure a more balanced approach to lawmaking.
* **Deliberation**: Having two chambers encourages more thorough debate and consideration of legislation, which can lead to more comprehensive laws.
* **Prevention of Abuse**: By dividing power, a bicameral system can limit the potential for abuse of power and ensure that no single group dominates the decision-making process.","Assuming you live in a democracy, does your country's legislative have one chamber or two?

72,"Real incomes in sub-Saharan Africa, referred to as Gross National Income per capita (constant 2017 PPP$) has not increased significantly in most countries [since 1990](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/country-insights#/ranks). I can think of a few reasons why, but I'm not entirely sure what the biggest reason is. Possible reasons (and multiple likely apply) include:

1. **Corruption**: Most African countries score poorly on Transparency International's [Corruption Perceptions Index](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2023), with only a few countries (Seychelles, Cabo Verde, Botswana, and Rwanda) scoring above 50/100. These few countries have had more economic success in recent decades than most other countries on the continent. However, the picture is not entirely uniform. For example, [Uganda](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/UGA) (26) has experienced significant economic growth (relative to population growth) since 1990, while [Namibia](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/NAM) (49) has accomplished less. Even [Botswana](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/BWA) (59) has only grown by about 66% since 1990, though from a higher base. Compare that to the Indo-Pacific. [Malaysia](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MYS) (50) has grown by about 170% (2.7x) since 1990, from almost the same base as Botswana. [Indonesia](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/IDN) (34), [Bangladesh](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/BGD) (24), [Cambodia](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/KHM) (22), and even [Myanmar](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MMR) (15 in 2012, after decades of military rule, lower than North Korea and Equatorial Guinea today) multiplied real incomes by several times since 1990. So, while corruption undoubtedly hinders economic growth and equality, it is not the only (or even preeminent) factor. Note that the Index is based on expert perceptions, not actual cases of corruption. However, it is widely recognized as a reliable source.
2. **The Cold War**: Many African countries got entangled during the Cold War, as the United States and the Soviet Union competed for influence. This included funding proxy groups, getting involved in civil wars, supporting independence movements at times (depending on their interests and the circumstances), and promoting their respective political and economic systems. This contributed to instability that still holds influence to this day. Some countries, such as [Angola](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/AGO), were particularly affected by the rivalry. However, other parts of the world that were battlegrounds during the Cold War (such as [Vietnam](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/VNM) and [Indonesia](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/IDN)) fared better post-1991, so this isn't the only factor.
3. **Past European colonialism**: European powers colonized Africa (I'm referring to the Scramble for Africa) to exploit its natural resources for its own economic and political gain. After colonialism ended, these countries were left with arbitrary borders, ethnic tensions, de jure democratic republics, and a lack of functional institutions. This created a power vacuum for corrupt dictators to exploit. However, this type of political system (kleptocratic authoritarianism) exists elsewhere in the world and hasn't led to economic prospects that are as dire. However, some Asian countries, such as India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, also have a history of colonialism and ethnic tensions, yet they have fared much better economically.
4. **Insurgencies and civil wars**: Some African countries have a history of (or even ongoing) civil wars and insurgencies, which disrupt economic activity and hold back progress. For example, the [Central African Republic](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/CAF) Civil War cost the country about 37% of its real income in one year. This is despite the fact that previous conflicts had occurred not long before, which (in theory) would limit how much further damage another conflict would cause. The [Burundi](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/BDI)an Civil War damaged real incomes over the course of several years instead of just one, but even after the conflict ended in 2005, real incomes in 2022 are the lowest they have been since the report started in 1990. The Second Congo War also severely damaged the [DRC](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/COD)'s economy, but there have been gradual improvements since then, despite continued fighting in the eastern part of the country. Meanwhile, [Myanmar](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MMR) only lost about 19% of its real income the year its civil war began, despite facing significant Western sanctions that worsened what the downturn otherwise would have been. The following year (despite the conflict continuing) actually experienced about 2.9% growth instead of a further decline. [Guatemala](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/GTM) experienced a decades-long civil war, yet their economy has fared better than much of sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, [Malawi](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MWI) has avoided major conflicts, while still being one of the poorest countries in Africa. So, the impact of armed conflict on an economy is (while undoubtedly negative) complex and not uniform. This can't be the only reason for the region's poverty.
5. **Neocolonialism**: This is what I am most inclined to believe is the primary cause of the lack of development in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The region is rich in natural resources that foreign powers (both Western and non-Western) need to power their economies. So, they may covertly interfere in elections, sell arms, and potentially even support coups to ensure that leaders who grant opaque resource extraction deals to foreign powers that benefit their economies and enrich local elites while neglecting local populations are in power, while leaders who cut these deals off in favor of diversification, domestic development, and anti-corruption are shut out of the system. This stifles the region's ability to prosper.

I would be happy to discuss and debate this. Which factors weigh the most? Am I missing other important considerations?",What is the primary cause of economic stagnation in sub-Saharan Africa?,Africa,"Real incomes in sub-Saharan Africa, referred to as Gross National Income per capita (constant 2017 PPP$) has not increased significantly in most countries [since 1990](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/country-insights#/ranks).

The [Burundi](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/BDI)an Civil War damaged real incomes over the course of several years instead of just one, but even after the conflict ended in 2005, real incomes in 2022 are the lowest they have been since the report started in 1990. The Second Congo War also severely damaged the [DRC](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/COD)'s economy, but there have been gradual improvements since then, despite continued fighting in the eastern part of the country. Meanwhile, [Myanmar](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MMR) only lost about 19% of its real income the year its civil war began, despite facing significant Western sanctions that worsened what the downturn otherwise would have been. The following year (despite the conflict continuing) actually experienced about 2.9% growth instead of a further decline. [Guatemala](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/GTM) experienced a decades-long civil war, yet their economy has fared better than much of sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, [Malawi](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MWI) has avoided major conflicts, while still being one of the poorest countries in Africa. So, the impact of armed conflict on an economy is (while undoubtedly negative) complex and not uniform. This can't be the only reason for the region's poverty.
5. **Neocolonialism**: This is what I am most inclined to believe is the primary cause of the lack of development in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The region is rich in natural resources that foreign powers (both Western and non-Western) need to power their economies. So, they may covertly interfere in elections, sell arms, and potentially even support coups to ensure that leaders who grant opaque resource extraction deals to foreign powers that benefit their economies and enrich local elites while neglecting local populations are in power, while leaders who cut these deals off in favor of diversification, domestic development, and anti-corruption are shut out of the system. This stifles the region's ability to prosper.

I would be happy to discuss and debate this. Which factors weigh the most? Am I missing other important considerations?What is the primary cause of economic stagnation in sub-Saharan Africa?"

I'd like you to tell me about the current situations of Sitarail in those two countries, namely the Abidjan-Ouagadougou railway, and its future.

As you may know, this salient relic of the french imperialism(Sitarail is still in France's possession) is thought to have been one of the main routes for trade and passenger voyage between the two states for a long time.
However, Wikipedia says the passenger operation of the railway has recently been suspended. As I saw the article, I got a little shocked and wondered what'd happen to this line.

Now, I've also read that now the refurbishment project of the Sitarail route, with the Abidjan Metro programme being constructed alongside it, has been put in place.

This is what I've ever seen, but I'd like to hear from local people who live near it and/or have taken a ride on it.

comments acceptable both in English and French.

222,"For centuries, the narrative of slavery has been dominated by the harrowing tales of the Trans-Atlantic trade, overshadowing another dark chapter in history - the Arab-Muslim slave trade. Spanning over a millennia, this trade abducted and castrated millions of Africans, yet it remains largely forgotten.

Lasting for more than 1,300 years, the Arab-Muslim slave trade is dubbed as the longest in history, with an estimated nine million Africans snatched from their homelands to endure unimaginable horrors in foreign lands. Scholars have aptly termed it a veiled genocide, emphasizing the sheer brutality inflicted upon the enslaved, from capture in bustling slave markets to the torturous labor fields abroad.

The heart of this trade lay in Zanzibar, where enterprising Arab merchants traded in raw materials like cloves and ivory, alongside the most valuable commodity of all - human lives. African slaves, sourced from regions as distant as Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia, were subjected to grueling journeys across the Indian Ocean to toil in plantations across the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula.

Meanwhile, the Trans-Saharan Caravan focused on West Africa, with slaves enduring treacherous journeys to reach markets in the Maghreb and the Nile Basin. Disease, hunger, and thirst claimed the lives of countless slaves, with an appalling 50 percent mortality rate during transit.

&#x200B;

>“THE PRACTICE OF CASTRATION ON BLACK MALE SLAVES IN THE MOST INHUMANE MANNER ALTERED AN ENTIRE GENERATION AS THESE MEN COULD NOT REPRODUCE.""

\-Liberty Mukomo

Unlike their European counterparts who sought laborers, Arab merchants had a different agenda, with a focus on concubinage. Women and girls were prized as sex slaves, fetching double the price of their male counterparts. Male slaves, on the other hand, faced a gruesome fate. Castration was rampant, rendering them eunuchs incapable of reproduction, thus altering an entire generation forever.

&#x200B;

>At Istanbul, the sale of black and Circassian women was conducted openly, even well past the granting of the Constitution in 1908.

*-Levy, Reuben (1957)*

While Europe and the United States eventually abolished slavery, Arab countries persisted, with some clandestinely engaging in the trade until as late as the 20th century. The impact of this trade on African societies was profound, disrupting social, reproductive, and economic structures in ways that continue to reverberate today.

As the world grapples with the legacy of slavery, it's crucial to acknowledge and remember the forgotten victims of the Arab-Muslim slave trade, whose suffering has been obscured by the passage of time. It's a stark reminder of the enduring scars left by one of humanity's darkest chapters.

Spanning over a millennia, this trade abducted and castrated millions of Africans, yet it remains largely forgotten.

Lasting for more than 1,300 years, the Arab-Muslim slave trade is dubbed as the longest in history, with an estimated nine million Africans snatched from their homelands to endure unimaginable horrors in foreign lands. Scholars have aptly termed it a veiled genocide, emphasizing the sheer brutality inflicted upon the enslaved, from capture in bustling slave markets to the torturous labor fields abroad.

The heart of this trade lay in Zanzibar, where enterprising Arab merchants traded in raw materials like cloves and ivory, alongside the most valuable commodity of all - human lives. African slaves, sourced from regions as distant as Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia, were subjected to grueling journeys across the Indian Ocean to toil in plantations across the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula.

Meanwhile, the Trans-Saharan Caravan focused on West Africa, with slaves enduring treacherous journeys to reach markets in the Maghreb and the Nile Basin. Disease, hunger, and thirst claimed the lives of countless slaves, with an appalling 50 percent mortality rate during transit.

>“THE PRACTICE OF CASTRATION ON BLACK MALE SLAVES IN THE MOST INHUMANE MANNER ALTERED AN ENTIRE GENERATION AS THESE MEN COULD NOT REPRODUCE.""

\-Liberty Mukomo

Unlike their European counterparts who sought laborers, Arab merchants had a different agenda, with a focus on concubinage. Women and girls were prized as sex slaves, fetching double the price of their male counterparts. Male slaves, on the other hand, faced a gruesome fate. Castration was rampant, rendering them eunuchs incapable of reproduction, thus altering an entire generation forever.

&#x200B;

>At Istanbul, the sale of black and Circassian women was conducted openly, even well past the granting of the Constitution in 1908.

*-Levy, Reuben (1957)*

While Europe and the United States eventually abolished slavery, Arab countries persisted, with some clandestinely engaging in the trade until as late as the 20th century. The impact of this trade on African societies was profound, disrupting social, reproductive, and economic structures in ways that continue to reverberate today.

As the world grapples with the legacy of slavery, it's crucial to acknowledge and remember the forgotten victims of the Arab-Muslim slave trade, whose suffering has been obscured by the passage of time. It's a stark reminder of the enduring scars left by one of humanity's darkest chapters.

228,"US Court Clears Tech Giants in Congo Child Labor Case

Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla held not liable for forced labor in Congo's cobalt mines.

In a recent ruling, a US court has absolved major tech companies, including Apple, Google's parent company Alphabet, Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla, of liability in a case concerning alleged support for child labor in cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The case accused the tech giants of benefiting from and aiding child labor in cobalt mining, but the court ruled in a 3-0 decision that they could not be held liable. The court stated that the companies were involved in nothing more than typical buyer-seller transactions with suppliers in the DRC. The decision highlighted that various other actors, including labor brokers and even the DRC government, contribute to labor trafficking in the region.

Initiated by 16 plaintiffs, including former miners and representatives of child miners who suffered injuries or lost their lives in cobalt mining operations, the case alleged that the defendants had knowledge of human rights violations in the DRC's cobalt supply chain.

The DRC holds a significant portion of the world's cobalt reserves, a critical mineral essential for rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles and electronic devices. While demand for cobalt is rising due to the green transition towards net-zero emissions, human rights organizations have highlighted serious abuses in the DRC's cobalt supply chain, including forced evictions.

This ruling underscores the challenges in holding multinational corporations accountable for human rights abuses in their supply chains and the need for increased transparency and accountability in global sourcing practices.

 The Nigerian Army has reportedly set Okuama community in the Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State ablaze over the killing of 16 soldiers on a peace mission by the community youths. 

The president, Tinubu, gave the military ""full authority"" to bring the soldiers' killers to justice

36 soldiers were killed in Niger last year during an operation, that country was not burnt to the ground.

Both incidents happened under Tinubu's regime but  vastly different results.

Is it not the scale of a small genoc!de to just burn a whole community because of some youths? 

This got tagged for questionable source last time so I’m adding my sources.

338,"I've seen that ""solution"" get suggested around and I'm always irritated by it. In order to Balkanize, a country has to be divided, provinces vs provinces, regions vs regions, or among ethnic lines. Congo does not have this problem. 

As large as the DRC is in terms of size and population, it's still one of the most united country on the continent. In Congo, we've known the mission from the outside has always been to Balkanize it, but the only thing that has hold the country together is its surprisingly level of unity.

In the 60s the [Balkanisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Katanga) plan was in full control, Katanga, where the Uranium  used to build the atomic bomb that was dropped on Japan , succeeded from Congo supported by Belgium and other western entities. This event was one of the many reasons Lumumba was killed. He opposed it. Katanga was later integrated after 3 years because....the people did not want to secede. It was all manufactured.

There have been attempts on creating secession movements in the East and it has always met with great resistance...because no Congolese wants to run away from Congo. When the M23 emerged, the western media kept on writing about ""Congolese rebels"" and how people from Kivu want to break away from the incompetent governance. All of that was of course a bunch of nonsense when they finally had to admit that the M23 are Rwandans. But as Congolese we knew this since day one. It's easy to differentiate a Congolese from a Rwandan. From Physical appearance to mannerism to language. We saw the M23 and we knew they were Rwandans.

The most resource rich regions in Congo are Kivu and Katanga. The most interfered region in Congo are Kivu and Katanga. 

The only thing that has hold the country together is our unity. We have a lot of ethnic groups but that's evened out with language. In Congo we have 2 main languages, Lingala in the west and Swahili in the east. Most Congolese speak 1 of those 2 languages. I can say split 50/50 or 55/45. Some speak both. They're both Bantu languages so it's easy to pick one once you know the other. A lot of people don't speak their ethnic languages anymore and just use either Lingala or Swahili.

Due to the 2 dominant languages, despite Congo having a lot of ethnic groups, we just break it down  into 2: Baswahili (Literally ""Swahili people"") and Bangala (Lingala people), of course you have the actual 2/3 dominate ethnic groups (Luba, Kongo, Mongo) but they also now largely communicate in Lingala (Kongo, Mongo) or both Swahili and Lingala (Luba). The 2 languages have made the country feel less divided amongst ethnic lines.

Most Congolese problems are never internal. It has always been from the outside. Name one issue and you'll be able to trace it back to an outside player. Every single assassination of our leaders have an outside player(s), every single secession attempt, virtually all rebels, etc. If Congo wasn't united, we could already have had several nations from it. Is the Congolese government incompetent? Sure. The current President is trying his best but we had 20 years of Kabila. This man would go and attack Congolese civilians when they would try to protect themselves against outside aggressions. That's how much of a puppet he was. 

In Congo we say that due its mineral and resources, Congo will never be free from outside entities. Congo will always have its competent leaders assassinated.

1. Devalue the currency so the people are way too poor and over reliant on government handouts. 

2. Take away the handouts. No subsidies, no proper funding of basic infrastructure like health, education, or electricity. Basically, takeaway the people's ability to build an economy. 

3. Take massive loans. Billions of dollars that the country cannot possibly payback and use the money on white elephant projects. Unnecessary airports, sports stadium, etc. 

4. Finally, force the country to give up their resources at giveaway prices since they cannot afford to payback their debt. Rinse and repeat.

398," The Battle of Adwa, which took place on March 1, 1896, was a pivotal moment in African history. It marked the first decisive victory of an African army against a European power, specifically the Italian forces. This triumph not only secured Ethiopia’s independence, but it also shattered the prevailing belief that all Africans would eventually fall under European rule during the colonial era.    


The Battle of Adwa was not merely a clash between Ethiopian forces led by Emperor Menelik II and Italian troops; it was a defining moment in African history.  The Ethiopian army’s triumph checked Italy’s ambitions to establish an empire in Africa. Adwa stands as the first crushing defeat of a European power by African forces during the colonial era. It shattered the prevailing belief that all Africans would inevitably fall under European rule. This resounding victory became a beacon of inspiration for the entire continent, showcasing the unwavering determination and unity of the Ethiopian people.    


In the annals of world history, Adwa remains a testament to courage, resilience, and the indomitable spirit of Africa.

Dear Friends,

As many of us are aware, there have been an increase in the reported numbers of Lassa virus cases in Nigeria. Many of us are likely to be aware that rats are often the hosts that facilitate the spread of the Lassa virus. At this time it is good to be aware of some key preventative measures. The waste excreted by mice infected by Lassa Fever contains the Lassa virus and contact with the infected mice’s waste can cause humans to be infected. There are currently six main Lassa virus clades (groups) are distributed across different West African countries: clades 1–3 (Nigeria), clade 4 (Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia), clade 5 (southern Mali) and clade 6 (recently reported from Togo).

According to recent reports from The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) revealed Nigeria has recorded a total of 1,068 Lassa fever cases across 112 Local Government Areas in 28 states between January and September.

I crossposted it, because I believe it is my duty as a black person to step and expose those who would lie about us. I crossposted the post so that many of us could disapprove the false narrative and educate those who don't know better. Based on the comment thread, my plan worked, and OP was exposed for his lies. 

However today I found that reddit removed my crosspost from reddit and I received the following message:

You telling me that my crosspost got me a warning and was taken down simply because I exposed someone who was literally lying about black people? The 27 year old kid still has his post up. What the hell is this. He can go around lying on reddit about black people, but I am not allowed to even defend black south africans and disapprove his lies. Reddit is fine with lies been spread about us and we are not even allowed to disapprove them. I don't know how long I have before my account is banned but I needed to expose the right wing crap of reddit.

The intention behind sharing these clips appears to have been to discredit the survivors, paint them in a bad light, and create doubt on the integrity of their claims.

609,"This important writing intends to discuss one of the historical chiefdoms and events that occurred in Somalia centuries ago but which were not documented, recorded and presented in the history books of Somalia and other historical archives of Somali kingdoms and dynasties.

Gedi Ababow also known as Geedi Shaambow was a king that ruled the Southwestern region of Bay in Somalia 700 to 1000 years ago before the European scramble for and arrival in Africa; whose administrative base was the district of Buur Hakaba and its vicinities.

Some historians say the correct name of this ruler was 'Gedi Abebe'.

Being oral societies who did not often document historical events in the past, Somalis describe Geedi Abaabow as a powerful king who was feared and whose rule was spread across the whole region.

Somali oral historians say that the king, Gedi Abaabow, was capable of climbing up the top of the mountain in Buur Habaka (196 feet) while on his horse, which is today an unimaginable thing while no one would also dare to challenge him right or wrong.

History everywhere comes with accounts of both good and bad acts committed by kings or rulers; Gedi Ababow is believed to have forced newly wedded women to sleep with him before they joined in with their husbands but this account of the story could not be verified since there are no documented historical evidences of such practices.

Gedi Ababow entered into many wars with rival clans in the region and was finally killed in a tactful and deceitful assault waged against him by other rival clansmen in Buur Hakaba district facilitated by one of his advisors and subordinates.

Until today, the artifacts and the impact of his rule in the region and Buur Hakaba district could still be seen; as the tombs of his daughter, Garamay Gedi lies just in the vicinity of Baidoa district, and that of his son, Gabow Gedi located near Ballow village in Buur Hakaba. Primitive structures made up of rocks including a rock bed that was used by Geedi Ababow is also still located on top of the mountain in Buur Hakaba.

In this same region of Bay and district of Buur Hakaba, other powerful rulers or chiefs ruled the location around or near the same period but whose stories were not picked for historical documentation and records; yet another fallout with the history of this part of Somalia. These rulers (chiefs) included Fayle Aarow and Dubka Baalow

Somali writers documented the histories of ancient kings, rulers, and chiefs in Somalia and presented them in history books. Unfortunately, the famous history of the ancient king in Buur Hakaba centuries ago was not recorded and documented in these history books. The reasons could be:

Somali historians who documented the historical occurrences in Somalia did not have full understanding of the chiefdoms (kingdoms) that existed in this part of Somalia and conduct objective research.
Somali writers deliberately ignored and discriminated against these rulers (kings) in this part of Somalia because they belonged to this location or certain group of people.
Local scholars and historians have not taken steps to research and document the history of their region and include it in the Somali history books.
As the local people now have educated people with capacities to research and document this history, they are encouraged to research and document the historical occurrences and events during the rule of these kings including Gedi Ababow; therefore, the coming generations would be able to read and to know the history of this part of Somalia.

In the future, there can be an archeological survey or experiment to discover more about the artifacts, remnants of tools used and cultural beliefs held during the rule of Gedi Ababow.

Despite the unrecorded history of Gedi Ababow, many Somali artists and musicians have made songs the lyrics of which relate to the king metaphorically.

The Banu Thabit were a dynasty that ruled Tripolitania during the 14th century. The dynasty's founder, Thabit ibn Ammar, was a member of the Amazigh Zakūğa tribe from the Huwwara tribal confederation. They gained independence from the weak Masmuda Hafisids of Tunis in 1326.

The Kanem–Bornu Empire existed in areas which are now part of Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Libya and Chad. It was known to Muslim geographers as the Kanem Empire from the 8th century AD onward and lasted as the independent kingdom of Bornu until 1900.

The Zanara were a nomadic Amazigh tribe that roamed Cyrenaica and Western Egypt.

The Banu Sulaym were a bedouin tribe that originated from South West Arabia, near the modern border of Saudi Arabia and Yemen. They migrated to Cyrenaica at the command of the Fatimids in the mid 11th century, displacing the native Lawata and Mazata Amazigh tribes, forcing them to flee into Tripolitania and Tunisia.

631,"Since the beginning of the 2020s, the President of Madagascar launched a series of important imfrastructures, and among them, a project of cable car and suburban rail transportation for the capital city of Madagascar, Antananarivo.  
The city which has almost 4 million people (while it has been designed for 500.000 people) is, like many African cities, victim of heavy traffic congestion (and even generates a 40 million $ loss every year according to World Bank), paralyzing the city. In order to solve this situation, the government launched these 2 transportation projects:

Cable Car: Madagascar signed an agreement with France in order to build a cable car network across the city, linking many places, in order to allow a faster transportation across the city. However, the project was seen as extremely expensive and irrational, considering the country's situation, daily energy shortages and especially after the estimated prices for a ticket were displayed (4.500 MGA, approximately 1 USD, which means 3/4 of daily income of an average Malagasy).

Suburban Train: In order to revitalize the urban railway network, rarely used by freight trains, suburban trains would be installed across a part of the city, in order to allow more people to commute by this public transport (as the bus network is extremely saturated). Trains were imported from Switzerland, tracks and train stations were built and rehabilitated, and can transport thousands of people every hour.

It is said that the suburban train would be finished by February approximately. The construction of the cable car is still ongoing.

The city which has almost 4 million people (while it has been designed for 500.000 people) is, like many African cities, victim of heavy traffic congestion (and even generates a 40 million $ loss every year according to World Bank), paralyzing the city.

Recently, I completed a feature-length documentary film titled **""TENERE,**"" **narrating the story of African migrants attempting to cross the Sahara Desert.** I filmed this extraordinary journey, which acquired mythological qualities reminiscent of Noah's Ark in the vast expanse of the desert, symbolizing humanity's resilience and fragility. **TENERE premiered at The Pan African Film Festival, the world's largest black film festival in the United States, and received the ""Best Cinematography"" award at the Manchester Film Festival, where it was nominated in three categories.** Despite the unfortunate timing of the pandemic, the film connected with audiences at numerous international film festivals, digital platforms, cinemas, and television.

Trailer of the film: [Trailer of TENERE](https://youtu.be/q-36uzQhvxs?si=i93slb5MNx031P-Z)

702,"A massive protests in borama (Awdal region) against the selling of their land to Ethiopia, by Somaliland. 
The youth of Awdal are pledging to defend thier ancestral land against any foreign entity. 

It is reported that the government of somaliland mainly serves the interest of one clan that wants to secede from Somalia, but some clans are not in an agreement with this secessionist project. 

The other clans believe that if they were to separate from Somalia they will be marginalized by the Somaliland government. This became evidently clear to the people of Awdal after the president of Somaliland gave away their land to Ethiopia to build a military base on.

There were clashes between the government of Somaliland and another clan (the derwish) few months ago, when the clan decided that they don’t want to be part of their project. However, the government of Somaliland responded with shelling of their city and a fight broke out between the two parties. As per the latest news, the clan was able to regain control of their land (known as SSC Khatumo) and have decided that they will be a state of Somalia, not Somaliland.
