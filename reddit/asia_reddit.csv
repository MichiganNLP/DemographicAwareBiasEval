7,"Hi 

I've been playing with the idea of possibly moving to south-east or east Asia. A quick youtube search didn't provide much information, other than just general stuff that could be said from most countries. I was wondering if you could give me some idea which might be the best countries to move into as a european, what to take into consideration and all that. I understand there might be a lot to tell, so if you could point me at a place to start learning more from, and maybe some personal anecdotes. 

I'm looking for a country that's generally neutral or welcoming to foreigners, would be relatively safe. Bonus points if the language isn't too difficult to learn. The more affordable fresh fruit available throughout the year, the better. 

I've only learned very little japanese and of their culture, but don't know that much from the other countries. ",Considering moving into Asia (east or south-east),Asia

27,"I believe Japan should abolish the internship program and the Tokutei 1 and 2 programs. They are no different from a form of modern slavery, with low wages, lack of freedom, and poor treatment. Despite their intelligence, their smartness leads their country into mediocrity and disrespect. Foreigners should be treated like native citizens in terms of wages, respect, and other issues.

Japan should also expand its open policy to all professions. Hourly wages are low, the cost of living is increasing, and there is class discrimination in jobs. They should also change immigration and citizenship policies to integrate with the world. Many people come to Japan to work, but many leave as well. Those who leave seek higher wages, a healthier society, quality of life, and easier settlement. The birth rate has dropped to a record low, and rural areas are aging. It's a society covered in darkness. Japan is aging and slowly dying due to the government's sluggishness, conservatism, and rigidity. It's too terrible.

I am planning to travel travel around south east Asia for 2 weeks from India.

I am looking to backpack for a few months. I have April to August available, and want to visit Southern Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. I am also interested in visiting Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Southern India if the weather is good there (not sure which months are best though..)

I am struggling to figure out how to time all of this around the weather and avoid the rains as much as possible. I am even willing to hypothetically fly to different countries (like Thailand to Sri Lanka then back to Malaysia, or wherever), just to try to make this work the best it possibly can.

47,"Hello everyone, I am a 19 year old guy from Europe, and sorry if my English writing, might show some particular grammar mistakes. I would like to discuss an issue, and honestly I don't know what to do, I am really stressed and I just want a escape from the mess that I am in.

For starters, Asia has been one of my favorite continent where I saw huge opportunities for everyone in the future. I was a big fan of the idea of Asia replacing the West, as the main driver of the economy's growth. In addition, I falled in love with a country named Indonesia. I don't know why, maybe the culture/people or maybe the language which was quite easier for me to learn (still a weeb) and I believed that such aspects would make it more easier to not just contribute, but also integrate into the Indonesian society. In addition, it's cities like Jakarta very truly mindblowing, it felt like a cheap Singapore. And that made me become more interested because cost of living also would support my life as a student

But as of now, I am having problems with my family, well it's nothing big, but more likely is their disagreement that the best place to study is China, and yes, I agree that China is better than anyone else. But I also think that despite being better than everyone, it doesn't mean that I must also go there. It's like imposing their desires against you at this point. How can I study there for 4 years, knowing very well about whether I would be happy or not.

I don't know honestly, which is why I am here. If you could give me a advice that is not biased and of course your personal opinion. Then I would also be happy to look at this community.

110," With the widespread popularity of smartphones and the internet, especially among individuals aged 12 to 30, entertainment options have largely been dominated by these technologies. Watching videos and playing video games have become the mainstream forms of entertainment. However, amidst this digital landscape, China still boasts a variety of unique entertainment options, each with its distinct Chinese flavor:

Square Dancing:  
Square dancing is a beloved pastime among older adults, who can be spotted dancing in squares or parks almost every morning and evening. It not only provides entertainment but also serves as an excellent opportunity for exercise and socializing. Occasionally, even young people join in after work in the evenings.

Mahjong:  
No discussion about Chinese entertainment is complete without mentioning mahjong. This traditional form of entertainment is hailed as a national treasure, where four people gather around a table and can play for hours. The joy of mahjong lies in the strategic rearrangement of tiles and the element of luck in drawing the tile needed for victory.

Foot Massage:  
Foot massage, also known as foot washing, offers effective relaxation, with water infused with traditional Chinese medicine. Derived from ancient theories of traditional Chinese medicine, foot massage has a long history and is a popular method for stress relief.

KTV:  
For young people from the post-80s and post-90s generations, KTV (karaoke) is a go-to choice for gatherings and celebrations like birthdays. They enjoy singing, dancing, and drinking, showcasing their talents at KTV venues. Though KTV businesses have somewhat declined with the rise of the digital age, the fun of karaoke remains timeless.

Table Tennis:  
Table tennis, fondly known as ping pong, holds the title of the most popular mass sport in China and is even referred to as the ""National Sport"". Found in almost every school, park, and community, table tennis tables are beloved by both children and the elderly, having been cultivated as a sport since childhood.

In addition to these activities, do you know any other types of entertainment unique to China?

I'm a 31-year-old entrepreneur with a knack for creating my own job opportunities. I run a social media consulting gig via Fiverr and have an Etsy shop selling candles (surprisingly my main income). Though not rich, I'm doing okay for myself.

However, my lifelong dream is to visit Asian countries like  Singapore, Japan, Korea, China, Indonesia etc. But, living in a third-world country means even plane tickets are a luxury. So, I've started thinking with my entrepreneurial mind.

If I can't just travel to Asia like a wealthy person, the next best thing‚Äîor perhaps even a better approach‚Äîwould be for people/companies to invite me to their countries and take care of my expenses (the best-case scenario).

I've started brainstorming entrepreneurial ideas to achieve this. One of my ideas is that i know that the beauty and cosmetics industry is vast. Having managed social media for a plastic surgeon for a while, I've seen it for myself. So, since many cosmetic products come from Korea. My idea is to contact Korean beauty product sellers that are not known in my country and start selling them here (a classic white-label business). This way, other companies might invite me to their country to showcase their products, etc.

This is just a draft idea, of course.

I am from a different continent, country, race and culture. This means my dating experience has been more open. I have only dated girls before so my attraction to him caught me by surprise. Our first real kiss I asked for it and after he said he thought I was going to go in for a peck but I went in for it. Since then we have been making out. Kisses, hugs and cuddles with no hands going further than our backs or necks. He is so amazing during these intimate moments because he will ask if I am okay with him kissing me. I love that because it's like consent in the most sexiest way because it's verbal and I can say yes. 
Here is my worry. I am not opposed to having him feel me up under my shirt. He had expressed that after we talked that things between us are pretty heavy sexual tension wise. So the other day he was sleeping over (we had dozed off during cuddles) then his hand went under my shirt and cupped one of my boobs. I liked it but I think it may have been too much for him. I am not ready for sex since I am a virgin and I think we need to keep exploring.

Looking for advices / feedbacks / name of NGO or non-profit or any structure committed in fighting poor housing / insalubrity / homelessness in Asia region :)

Hi everyone,  
I (F25) am an architect (master's grade in France, ""architecte DE"" title). After working for some time in a conventional studios and experiencing a few burnouts, I decided to leave the traditional way of practicing architecture.

I committed to a ""civic service"" (volunteer) in a French association whose aim is to fight poor housing and unsanitary conditions (Les Compagnons B√¢tisseurs). The core of the action is to carry out rental-related works with the help of the inhabitants at a very low cost (various grants supporting the budget). The educational and social dimension is at the heart of the exchanges; the goal is also to transmit savoir-faire so that the inhabitants could take care of and repair their homes themselves afterwards.  
My tasks consisted of doing small repairs, DIY, furniture construction, and rental-related works (tiling, painting, flooring, basic plumbing, building kitchen, etc...) What I liked about this job is the multitasking aspect of the employees; social contact with first visits, plan design, material selection, quotations, and above all, manual labor and educational dimension.  
After almost a year in this field, I am quite familiar with building simple things, the functioning of this kind of non-profit organisation, the financial structuring of operations, in a very French ecosystem.  
My civic service is coming to an end, and I am now considering what to do next. I think I will look for work in this field, as I reaaaaally don't want to go back to the ""traditional"" way of working in a studio (even though I know some cool studios working and advocating for these, I really want to get out of the traditional way of doing architecture and I want to work more in-field)

I would like to know if this kind of non-profit structures / work model exists abroad because I would love to move out of France (lived and studied in South-East Asia, like HK & Malaysia, more interested in this geographical area but curious about the whole world!).  
Do you know any similar structures where I could potentially find a job (worldwide), with main missions including:

* Housing diagnostic, first visits, social help orientation and assistance, human contact
* Management of small / rental-related architectural projects
* Manual jobs (I can do almost everything now, tiling, flooring, painting, basic plumbing and electricity, in short, everyday DIYing)

I currently know of a few structures presents in Asia, only by name (such as Habitat for Humanity, but not sure if these are really helping - need to dig into their work).  
Do you know of structures like mine operating in Asia? Ones that have real ethical and committed actions in the field of fighting poor housing or homelessness? And that are not voluntourism or feeding into dubious networks / white savior? Looking for advices / feedbacks!

Thank you for your responses!  
Cheers!

A Korean actress is being criticized by Korean fans for her romantic relationship. Following K-pop idol Karina, actress Han So-hee is being criticized for her romantic relationship with actor Ryu Jun-yeol. Han So-hee is being criticized for dating Ryu Jun-yeol right after Ryu Jun-yeol and his ex-girlfriend (actress Hyeri) broke up. Suspicion is that Han So-hee seduced Ryu Jun-yeol while Ryu Jun-yeol and Hyeri were relationship. 

Han So-hee completely denied the allegations on her blog, saying, ""I have never seduced a man with a girlfriend.""

Surprisingly, all three of them are unmarried men and women. Is it so reprehensible that unmarried men and women are free to relationship? Why do they have to explain their love affairs?

Hello Everyone,

First post on here.

I would love to ask for some information.

I am planning to travel across South East Asia countries, specifically Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Nepal, From July to Sept/Nov. The idea is constantly moving across different places, maybe staying a bit longer in some.

But the question is: travelling during the Monsoon Season is it really that bad?

Now, I've already done plenty of research about it, and I know pretty well the different periods where this season may be ""stronger"" in certain countries compare to others, but I would like to know from people who have actually visited these countries during this period the last 2 years or so. Has your journey being affected by Monsoon? If so, how? Would you recommend it? Most say it is actually a great period to travel South East Asia as it is less touristic and cheaper. is it really that simple? Also considering I am planning to move frequently.

Thank you so much to whoever will take the time to comment this post with their experience, any extra tips or suggestion is more than welcome. Thank you :)",Travelling South East Asia during Monsoon Season,Asia

245,"Honestly, it's as if these terminally online Asian nationalists in the West live in Thailand, where it'd be beyond their logic to question why the Prime Minister of even the King of Thailand would allow an environment where women would feel the need to sell their bodies to foreign tourists in order to make a living.. Just because Thailand is not a country where you're allowed to criticize the King, does it mean that he's beyond criticism when it comes to allowing his country to be an environment conducive to low-quality tourists? Even though Thailand has been ruled by an army guy within this past decade, though who isn't the Prime Minister anymore, would it not be his fault if he didn't manage to provide enough opportunities for the women, so that way they don't feel like there's more money to be made by bending the knee to low quality tourists than otherwise? 

The same goes for English teachers.. Although it's sincerely shallow and silly that South Korea employs English teachers whose only contribution is that they speak English, and not even that they also speak Korean, would it not be the fault of the Korean government that the bar is so low when it comes to who can qualify as an English teacher, rather than the English teachers who go ahead and take this opportunity? The same goes for other Asian countries, especially China..

The way in which these Asian nationalists insult the intelligence of others when they talk about Thailand, South Korea, and China as if they're innocent, little babies, where they don't even consider acknowledging that these governments do have a role to play in why such low quality tourists would go to Thailand for low quality reasons and why such low quality is allowed to go and become English teachers in South Korea and China.. As much as Western imperialism isn't a factor that can be fully obscured when it comes to the discussion revolving around this, what does it say about the King or Prime Minister of Thailand if there's more energy against Thais who criticize them, than the low quality tourists who come and take advantage of the environment they've enabled where low quality seemingly is the only way you can make good money? 

What does it say about the elite of South Korea and China if they themselves don't respect Asian culture enough to hire English teachers from Singapore or Philippines, who would have the added benefit of understanding them more intricately better than some rando from USA, who would be inclined to not respect them and think less of them? 

As much as a Korean American or a Chinese Australian would be inclined to have an inferiority complex as non-white people in the white West, the discrepancies between how they view tourism and English teachers compared to the elite of Thailand, South Korea and China shows how silly it can be for Asians in the West to project their inferiority complex onto Asians in Asia. Not saying it's not important to acknowledge inequalities and to try and resolve those when it comes to how Thailand, South Korea, and China run, with consideration of the US' role in the world, but it gets to the point where the King of Thailand isn't even considered as culpable when it comes to why Westerners go to Thailand for low quality reasons, but said Westerners tourists, or the South Korean President doesn't have enough autonomy, especially as the President of a really rich country, to make the bar so high for English teachers that simply being a native English speaker from Canada wouldn't be enough..

248," 

There is a prejudice that big cities in less developed countries are crazy crowded. However, when the population is large, even areas in advanced societies also become extremely crowded. An example is a  Tokyo, hong kong, new york, taipei, european big cities.

Tokyo is very developed, but it is incredibly crowded considering its population. It looks like Bangkok or Manila. LA in the US also has huge traffic jams and New York is extremely crowded. 

However, Seoul and Korea are exceptions. Korea is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, but compared to other high-density countries, it feels very empty and it is relatively rare to see crowds.

In other words, infrastructure and level of development is not the only factor.

In Seoul, except for a few places, it is hard to feel that there are really many people on weekdays, but in Japan, where infrastructure is similarly developed, there are a lot of people everywhere you go.

Even in South Korea, there are many urban areas outside of Seoul that are completely ghost towns and where it is difficult to see people. This is a country the size of Portugal but with a larger population than Spain. Moreover, South Korea has many mountains and agricultural fields. Nevertheless, this phenomenon appears. This is really strange.","Aside from infrastructure and advanced civilization, what are the factors that make it less crowded despite the enormous population size?",Asia

252,"It's one thing if South Africa and Suriname, by virtue of the legacy of Dutch colonization, inevitably has some racial and ethnic tensions that manifest in the way these countries operate in the 21st century, whether by settler-colonialism in regards to South Africa or being a country in the New World in regards to Suriname. However, it's another thing if Indonesia, even in spite of the legacy of Dutch colonization, willingly imposes on itself the issue of racial tensions, in addition to ethnic tensions, when it comes to West Papua being under their control. Even if Indonesia mainly sees money signs when it comes to West Papua, if there's one Dutch colony that should know better when it comes to how others have suffered under European colonization and not causing more harm if they're able to not to, it should be Indonesia, because South Africa and Suriname can't control that they're artificial countries, significantly populated with both indigenous and immigrant populations, the ways in which European colonizers have historically exploited those divides for their own ends, and how that manifests into how they're run. 

Even if Indonesians don't have that same understanding of race that South Africans and perhaps Surinamese would have, I think the main problem with Indonesia in this regard is how West Papuans are amongst the poorest in Indonesia, similar to how black people are amongst the poorest in South Africa, for example. Even though Indonesia doesn't have that same ruling Dutch elite, or at least historic ruling Dutch elite, that South Africa had, why are they causing the same colonialism, especially of the settler kind, that they don't have to cause?

Hi, I've been approved by my university for an internship/short-term   job experience in Taiwan. However, I'm required to secure it myself  and  I get no help from my university in organizing all this. I've tried   reaching out via several job portals I found through Google and  through  my country's and through my country's Economical and Cultural  Office.  Unfortunately no hits so far.   

I'm looking for advice. I'm searching for anything   banking/finance/business related and it should take place from February to April 2025. Perhaps you know of something yourself, or know someone   who knows someone, or you can direct me to a job portal or any other   place where I could continue my pursuit.

267,"Hello fellow travelers,

I‚Äôm in the process of booking a flight from China to Seattle, USA, for my parents, who are both over 65 and speak very basic English. I‚Äôm torn between two options and could really use some insights or experiences to help make this decision.

Option 1: Asiana Business Class with a transfer in Incheon. The journey involves a 2.5-hour flight to Incheon, a 4-hour layover, and then a 10.5-hour flight to Seattle. The total cost is around $3000 USD. The benefits here seem to be the comfort of business class for the longer segment of the flight and access to business lounges during the layover.

Option 2: Delta Premium Select on a direct 11.5-hour flight to Seattle. This option is more straightforward and costs $1600 USD, making it significantly cheaper. While Premium Select offers more comfort than economy, its seat can not be put flat as business class.

I‚Äôm trying to balance considerations of comfort, ease of travel (especially considering the language barrier and their age), and cost. My main concerns are:

	‚Ä¢	The complexity and stress of transferring flights in Incheon for my elderly parents who don‚Äôt speak English well.
	‚Ä¢	Whether the comfort and amenities of Asiana‚Äôs Business Class justify the higher cost and longer total travel time compared to Delta‚Äôs Premium Select direct flight.

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has faced a similar choice, has experience with these classes of service, or can offer insights into navigating Incheon Airport with limited English. Any advice, experiences, or factors I might not have considered would be greatly appreciated.

Last year we were in northern Thailand and there was already really bad smoke, so if Laos is even worse then we need to sadly think about another area to go to.

Has anyone been to northern Laos at this time of year? Was it really that bad as you read on blogs, news, etc...

295,"Hello,

This might sound unusual, but it's genuinely my dream.

I'm a 30-year-old entrepreneur with a knack for creating my own job opportunities. I run a social media consulting gig via Fiverr, have an Etsy shop selling candles (surprisingly my main income), and occasionally translation jobs. Though not rich, I'm doing okay for myself.

However, my lifelong dream is to visit Asian countries like Japan, Korea, Thailand, China, etc. But, living in a third-world country means even plane tickets are a luxury. So, I've started thinking with my entrepreneurial mind.

If I can't just travel to Asia like a wealthy person, the next best thing‚Äîor perhaps even a better approach‚Äîwould be for people/companies to invite me to their countries and take care of my expenses (the best-case scenario).

I've started brainstorming entrepreneurial ideas to achieve this. I'm know that the beauty and cosmetics industry is vast. Having managed social media for a plastic surgeon for a while, I've seen it for myself. So, since many cosmetic products come from Korea. My idea is to contact Korean beauty product sellers that are not known in my country and start selling them here (a classic white-label business). This way, other companies might invite me to their country to showcase their products, etc.

This is just a draft idea, of course.

I'm eager to hear other ideas from those of you who have traveled to Asian countries for your job/business or know/seen people who visit these countries regularly. Thank you.",Entrepreneurial Ideas to Take Me to Asia!,Asia

357,"Hey guys, I'm a hostel worker over here, currently living in Spain and I have a honest doubt about something that seems cultural/normal to specifically chinese and korean people. 

Since I work in a hostel (not a hotel) where bathrooms and toilets are shared with everybody else, it seems to be normal among chinese and korean to bath outside the shower, like, pretty much 80% of the time that they leave toilets I need to go the mop cause the floor will be all wet. Not just water drops, but wet, like they showered where you wash your hands.

Even tho we as the staff gently asks to not doing it cause another person will use the bathroom after them, they keep doing it.

Can somebody explain or clarify why this happens?

363,"Guys, I spent quite some time in Laos and one of my favorite things about the Lao cuisine is the dish of fresh raw herbs and vegetables that you are often served along your main meal. There was always this vegetable they called ""long bean"" which is absolutely delicious and with the ability to be eaten raw ! Unlike most other legumes, especially beans. I would love to try and grow it at home (central Europe) either in a green house or indoors. Just to try and see if it's possible to cultivate and enjoy this delicious plant here at home. Whenever I try to order seeds tho I come across multiple different species that are called long bean in English. I want to be absolutely sure I am buying the correct species, the one that's edible while raw, and that's often served in south East Asia, Laos specifically. I would be super happy if someone could provide me with the proper latin/scientific name of the exact species so I can order the right one and get my experiment started in this spring.

I‚Äôll go on a work trip in Osaka Japan. Which will finish mid Feb and then me and my gf will go on a 3 week trip around Southeast Asia. 
We are planning to stay in Thailand for two weeks and one week in either Bali Or Philippines (boracay or Palawan) not in particular order but I do not see any direct flight from Philippines/Bali
 to Amsterdam (our home) so I guess it‚Äôs nice to leave from Bangkok hence we will spend the last two weeks in Thailand. 
So my questions come to:
1) is Bali or Philippines more suitable? Seems it‚Äôs rainy season in Bali around Feb so I guess it‚Äôs more reasonable to go to Philippines. But I do not see any direct flights from osaka to either Palawan or boracay. Or should we consider other country instead ?

2) if we do end up going to Philippines. Should we just stay in either Palawan or boracay? Which is more recommended? We‚Äôre both not very athletic so we‚Äôre thinking to just chill and drinks not doing much sports. 
Or is one week enough to do both ?

Some people recommended to just stay in thailand for three weeks but my gf wants to visit other country as she‚Äôs been to thailand before.

It's fascinating to witness such a significant commitment from a global powerhouse like China toward blockchain technology. With the influx of developers into state-driven blockchain initiatives, there's a clear intention to solidify their position in the crypto space and likely drive innovation in various sectors.  


This move could potentially reshape the landscape of blockchain technology and its applications, not just within China but on a global scale. The sheer scale of this effort signals China's determination to lead in this rapidly evolving sector.  


I'm already happy to have some great blockchain solutions and projects that become a must in several industries, including NeuroChain, Venom, CertiK, and plenty of others.
