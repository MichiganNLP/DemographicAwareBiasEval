However, the way it came out for me is now very similarly looking to Moko design: it uses elements like shark teeth, koru, rafters and fishing hooks. I am so interested in the cultures of the peoples of Polynesia, probably the fact that I study it so much, affects my creativity in that way

I‚Äôm Ukrainian and have no Polynesian origin. Unfortunately, my people and our culture know how terrible cultural expropriation is and how destructive it can be. That‚Äôs why I as much as possible don't want to do this to other culture and need your help

So, I want to ask indigenous Polynesians ‚Äì is it appropriate or not to use graphic elements like that in my artworks and crafts (without pretending that this is Polynesian art)? Is there a line that separates using similarly looking shapes, and trying to impersonate Ta Moko? Should I continue this artwork (and would it be ethical to sell prints of it) or better change the pattern to something more neutral?

35,"I grew up for much of my life under the American education system. I learned quite a bit from my time through the American education system about how the region of the Pacific from Rapa Nui to Aotearoa were settled by Austronesian who came from what is now Southern China and Taiwan and sailed thousands of miles throughout the Pacific to settle in places like Rapa Nui, Aotearoa, Hawaii, Tahiti and even Madagascar. 

I was also taught from the education I went through was how much of the discoveries of these islands were actually done by the European explorers who came to the Islands in the Pacific like the French, British, Portuguese, Spanish and Americans later on went and colonized much of the Pacific Islands regions and colonized the region with extreme brutality. That brutality was not talked about in our education system. I was not taught much about Hawaii and how it became a U.S State after the overthrow of the monarchy there and how Native Hawaiians were displaced by other migrants who came like the Chinese, Japanese and Filipinos who would come to work on the plantation industries there. 

I am very surprised to see today how little self-determination there is today for Polynesian and Austronesian countries. Aotearoa is known as New Zealand and still has the British monarchy as the official head of state and the MƒÅoris are a persecuted minority, French Polynesia is basically just like France but in the middle of the Pacific instead of Western Europe, Samoa and Fiji also have the British monarchy as the official head of state, New Caledonia again, just like France but out in the Pacific. There are hardly any islands in the Pacific left that are under sovereign rule by the native population. The only exception may be Micronesia, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Nauru and a few others. 

It disappoints me to see how the islands in the Pacific have had so much of their culture destroyed due to centuries of colonization by Europeans and Americans. If Israel can have self-determination and revive and flourish their culture after thousands of years of colonization and foreign rule, why can‚Äôt Polynesians and Austronesians do the same? Bring back your rituals, etiquettes, dance, language, food, family values and everything together and please! For fucks sake, get the monarchy out, get the French influence and governance out of there and stop trying to force your children to learn English or French! Teach them your native language! Remove these institutions that were put on by the British, French and the Americans and create your own governance and institutions that works for your people. This whole nation building thing of spreading democracy around the world has really backfired and is a total shit show in many regions around the world. Do what works best for the Polynesians. Do what works best for the Austronesians. Only you know what is best for you. You can still have a future where you can determine what is best for your people.

38,"There have been some quiet concerns growing within Oceanic cultures regarding the preservation of language and culture. The most known case of this happening is within Hawai'i. Upon the overthrow of the indigenous ways by the United States and British influence, Polynesians have been trying to maintain their way of life after being forced to speak English and learn Anglo-Saxon western culture. In addition to this, Micronesians have their fair share of language and culture loss with the many tourists from Japan and the United States trying to slowly push their customs and courtesies into that part of Oceania. Anyone have any personal accounts or stories from others' experiences like this? Melanesians are having their homes disrespected and losing control over the islands they've inhabited long before others decided to settle there.

This is the official account of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), a global investigative journalism network. 

We recently [published a story](https://www.occrp.org/en/the-pandora-papers/murdered-papua-new-guinea-ports-official-benefitted-from-suspect-offshore-payments) about payments involving a major port operator ICTSI, an offshore account, and two port officials in Papua New Guinea. It should be of interest to this subreddit.

We found that global port operator ICTSI paid US$4.3 million to an offshore account around the time it won contracts to run Papua New Guinea‚Äôs biggest container terminals.

The offshore account was owned by Don Matheson, a well-connected Australian consultant in Papua New Guinea (PNG). From 2010, Matheson consulted with PNG Ports, the state-owned corporation that has authority over the terminals. 

Two senior PNG Port officials then received apparent benefits from Matheson‚Äôs offshore account, records show.

We'd really love to go over to Tanna for at least one night, mainly to see the volcano but also to see other parts of the island and do some snorkelling if possible. There are so many options for doing this - packages from Port Vila including flights and accommodation/book the flight and accommodation ourselves and get a tour either through our accommodation or with some other company, etc. Ideally we'd like to be able to see the volcano both during the day and at night. We're trying to keep costs down as much as possible, so budget accommodation is fine. I speak fairly fluent French, if that's a factor.

Can anyone recommend a particular company or way of organising this ourselves? What usually works out as the most cost effective way to visit Tanna but still get to see things on a short visit?

I get this question too many times ‚Äì Austria and Australia are two names that, at first glance, look very similar. But a closer inspection reveals some important differences between the two countries and their respective people. If you‚Äôre traveling abroad, or if you‚Äôre just trying to understand your European or Australian neighbor better, then here‚Äôs how to tell the difference between Austria and Australia based on key features of their culture, language, cuisine, and more.

## Pronunciation Section

Austria and Australia are two countries that are often confused for one another. While they may share some similarities, there are also a number of key differences that set them apart. For starters, Austria is pronounced Ow-stree-uh while Australia is pronounced Ow-streyl-yuh, and it doesn‚Äôt stop here.

## Geography Section

Austria and Australia are two very different countries located on opposite sides of the world. Though they share a similar name, they are not the same country. Austria is located in Central Europe while Australia is located in Oceania. Austria has a population of 8.7 million people while Australia has a population of 25 million people. The official language of Austria is German while the official language of Australia is English. Finally, Austria‚Äôs capital city is Vienna while Australia‚Äôs capital city is Canberra.

## Size/Land Area Section

Austria is a landlocked country located in Central Europe. The country is slightly smaller than the state of Maine with a total land area of 83,871 square kilometers. In comparison, Australia is significantly larger with a total land area of 7,688,000 square kilometers. That means Australia is almost 92 times larger than Austria!

&#x200B;

## Currency Section

When it comes to currency, there is a big difference between Austria and Australia. Austria uses the Euro as its currency, while Australia has its own currency called the Australian Dollar. The exchange rate between these two currencies can fluctuate, so it‚Äôs important to be aware of the current rate before traveling if you consider to. When it comes to prices, Austria is generally more expensive than Australia. This is due to a number of factors, including the cost of living and wages in Austria.

## The Flag Section

Probably the most obvious difference between Austria and Australia is their flags. The Austrian flag consists of three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and red. The flag of Australia is blue with the Union Jack in the upper left corner and six white stars‚Äîthe Southern Cross constellation‚Äîspread across the bottom half.

 Never before has any work on Polynesian mythology been dealt with in this way.  Never before has the filiation between gods and heroes been so clearly expressed.  The author Martine Dorra, to get to the writing of Tahiti Des Dieux et Des H√©ros, conducted an in-depth genealogical research of these mythical characters.

So I am a 21 year old (aspiring) writer, the first drafts of my stories have had predominantly good reviews by friends, family and some people that are familiar with the publishing industry so right now I am writing my first full fantasy novel.

I study history and use a lot of my own studies as inspiration for my own created peoples but the unfortunate thing about this is that I live in Western Europe and most history I learn is eurocentric in nature.

However in my stories I would like some different cultures as well and I am currently working on an island civilization with close to a uniform culture to serve as a major player alongside the European like cultures I have already created.

I want to learn about these cultures in the real world as well so I don't completely ruin these and offend anyone that has roots or lives in island cultures irl but so far online I have not been able to find any coherent, trustworthy or relevant sources and many of them seem to contradict each other.

It being a fantasy novel I am mostly interested in how did these islands communicate with one another, were there conflicts (on a large scale) did they have kings or elders governing them and stuff like that. So far all I've been able to deduce is that they used clubs for weapons and that there are 3 major cultures round the pacific Islands (Micronesia, Polynesia and melanisia) all though this might already be wrong.

So my question now is if any of you know of good video's, podcasts, studies, websites, etc. that I can look into to develop better knowledge of these things (and if any of the info i have written down here is false already please let me know)

If anyone has a free 5-10minutes, researchers from UNSW Sydney are undertaking this new study aimed at examining your experiences with trying to return to your country of residence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are interested in seeking those people who have been affected by travel restrictions (either by your home country or another country) and as a result have had to change travel plans.

Very little is known about the impact of travel restrictions on individuals, and we would like to understand the positive and negative impacts on people. We would also like to use this information to inform governments on how they can support people better in the future.

The research study is looking for people who:

\-Are aged 18 years and above

\-Can read and understand English

\-Have tried to return to your country of residence but have had your travel plans changed

P.A. Minnell is the author of The Maori Oracle with cards, unfortunately passed away prematurely, but who managed to give the world a valuable tool to delve into the Maori culture. I was struck by the way she presented her book a few years ago. In a passionate and heartfelt way:

&#x200B;

""Kia Now from New Zealand! I was born and raised here in New Zealand. I spent half of my childhood in Auckland by the sea and the other half in Waiouru, an alpine desert in the mountains. These days I'm back by the sea, also in New Zealand, living with my husband and our beautiful daughter. Writing and illustrating 'The M√£ori Oracle' has been an extraordinary journey of recognition, rediscovery, recovery and understanding for me. It was requested and given to all of us by the Tipuna (ancestors) and they have been the ones guiding it all along the way. Through the Tipuna I have discovered how much we truly have left in our families, in terms of our heritage. And through loved ones, both on this side of life and the other, I have also learned to value my work and begin to celebrate my gifts. It's been a comforting experience.""

&#x200B;

The Gregorian Calendar is a form of British cultural colonisation, not reflecting the cycle of life in different places on the planet. In light of this, it is clear that the Matariki - an astronomical time system, is a fundamental symbol of MƒÅori identity, of 'who I am' and 'where I am', marking the beginning and end of the MƒÅori year.
