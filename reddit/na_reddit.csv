7,"Hello!

# Intro:

1. My name is Nic Bentulan. I'm a dual citizen of Hong Kong & the Philippines.
2. I was the 1 who posted the [joke beads theory that Elon Musk tweeted](https://mathematiciowned.wordpress.com/?p=1889). I didn't create the theory. I just shared it. I do have my own theory about the matter, but I think saying this theory will violate 1 of the supposed neutrality for this post.
3. But as for bias, we in the Philippines tend to hate Magnus [out of our bias](https://mathematiciowned.wordpress.com/?p=1315) for Philippine-born American Wesley So (the 2019 World Fischer Random chess champion, whom American 1972 world chess champion Bobby Fischer might consider 'the real world champion', mwahahaha), who left the Philippines in [2014 due to corruption](https://mathematiciowned.wordpress.com/?p=1013). So there you know Gasai my bias.

# Anyway the story is ...  the [Carlsen–Niemann controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsen%E2%80%93Niemann_controversy)

1. **In 2022Sep**, Norwegian Magnus Carlsen, the 5-time & reigning world chess champion [accuses](https://twitter.com/MagnusCarlsen/status/1574482694406565888)  19yo Jewish American prodigy Hans Niemann of in-person (aka 'OTB' meaning over-the-board) cheating in their game at the 2022 Sinquefield Cup.
   1. Hans has a history of online cheating. - Hans cheated - or well, was caught cheating online twice, once when e was 12yo and once when e was 16yo. But Hans has no proven history of OTB cheating.
2. **In late 2022Oct,** Hans [sues Magnus](https://twitter.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1583164606029365248) (& 2 other parties mentioned later below).
3. It's said in the lawsuit & elsewhere that while Magnus has stated that e refuses play people caught cheating, **Magnus somehow still plays these 3 players who have been caught cheating :**
   1. Indian [Pranav Venkatesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranav_V),
   2. Iranian [Parham Maghsoodloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parham_Maghsoodloo) &
   3. French [Sébastien Feller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9bastien_Feller)
4. Less 'known' in the sense it's like a 'best kept secret' (like Catholic Church's Social Teachings) is that [**Magnus**](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88625/would-it-be-have-been-unhelpful-for-hans-niemann-to-bring-up-magnus-carlsens) **has** [**cheated**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ-5BYlWYNRTDQu5KKI6SS2vodHnn-2TU) **too**, both online & OTB, but ***Magnus was never sanctioned***. However Magnus' cheating is more like 'bullying cheating' than the 'engine cheating' that Magnus is accusing Hans of. I was told that Magnus' cheating is more akin to 'fouls' in basketball or 'yellow cards' in football/soccer. But well you decide for yourself. There are a lot of videos, and most comments seem to defend Magnus.
   1. Eg when Magnus cheated [16yo Iranian-French Supergrandmaster Alireza Firouzja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPysTEW0YZU&t=696s) in the 2019 blitz world chess championship...
   2. ...Eg 1 decade after 19yo Magnus cheats the [then-women's world chess champion Jewish Russian-Swiss Grandmaster Alexandra Kosteniuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeyXKTVYenA). (Compare 19yo Hans vs 19yo Magnus...)
      1. In the 1994 Linares tournament, Magnus' predecessor as world chess champion Jewish Russian Garry Kasparov (who is anti-Putin btw) similarly [cheated Hungarian & fellow Jew Grandmaster Judit Polgar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M5RE1M3uY0), the undisputed greatest & most talented [female chess player of all time](https://mathematiciowned.wordpress.com/?p=3032) (both GOAT & [MTOAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A52UXLpplTw) in women's chess).
   3. Eg when Magnus cheats [Jewish American grandmaster Danya Naroditsky twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLvN3aL_gdE) \- once in 2020May & another in 2021Dec.
5. **99% of top players** say there's not enough evidence, at least for 'reasonable doubt' that Hans cheated in that particular game. But some suspect under 'balance of probabilities'. Some also say maybe Hans cheated OTB in other games. (Yeah it's unsure if *Hans* cheated OTB, but it's sure *Magnus* cheated....)

# Main question: What's your opinion of the Hans Niemann vs Magnus Carlsen controversy?

# Sub-questions :

1. Are you 'Team Magnus'?  Or 'Team Hans' ?
2. What do you think of your 3 compatriots in this story?
   1. **Jewish American Grandmaster Hans Niemann, the 'ex-con' (but ex-convict as a minor)** \- Did Hans cheat in the OTB game vs Magnus? Do you think Hans cheated online more times than e claimed? Do you think Hans cheated OTB prior?
   2. **American International Master Danny Rensch, the chief chess officer of chessdotcom aka** **chessc\*m** **(it's a lichess joke)** \- In early 2022Oct, chessc\*m published [a report](https://www.chess.com/blog/CHESScom/hans-niemann-report) about Hans that claimed Hans had apparently cheated in a lot of online games. While they say there's insufficient evidence Hans cheated OTB, either for that game vs Magnus or for any other OTB game, they still talk about Hans' unusual OTB rise. Do you think it's fair
   3. **Japanese-born American Supergrandmaster Hikaru Nakamura,** who made controversial remarks on twitch about Hans. - [Was it genuine? Or was it for content?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sfb6o1oWBU)
3. What do you think of Magnus Carlsen?
   1. Was it morally right for Magnus to publicly accuse Hans?
   2. Was it stupid for Magnus to publicly accuse Hans? Brian Towers, [a moderator of chess stackexchange](https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/40669/how-strong-should-the-evidence-for-cheating-be-before-you-reveal-it), says it's stupid to publicly accuse someone because with private accusations, arbiters can monitor future events which will make it more likely to catch them. So arguably, public accusations are like 'war crimes' - yes they're evil, but they're also stupid because it harms your side as well.
   3. Is Magnus a hypocrite?
   4. What do you think of those people defending Magnus' 'bullying cheating'?
   5. What do you think about 'bullying cheating' vs 'engine cheating' ?
   6. Is Magnus inconsistent (or maybe some *other negative adjective* if you know Gasai what I mean) in refusing to play Hans but not Parham, Pranav & Sébastien?",Chess - What's your opinion of the Hans Niemann vs Magnus Carlsen controversy?,North America

Chapter 1- The Tweet 

"" How does this Loko Capita want my golf courses to appear? Like her ️sandpaper crotch! No way… Can't she get a nice haircut? Brawling  jenny… “

 President Trump tweeted on his phone at 01.45 hours, half asleep on the big sofa, he had yet not changed for the night. First Lady Melania entered the room, seeing him doze off, she untied his shoes, pulled off the socks, and heaving his tie, whispered in a soft voice, ‘Dahling’. Trump half-opened his eyes and the both holding one another, tumbled on the majestic double bed lying nearby. President Trump slept with his head on her chest like a baby. Melania waited till he fell into a deep slumber and returned to her bedroom.

CNN Director Morrison had just reached home after visiting the recently renovated news studio. Donald Trump had been hovering over the digital spectrum of New York for the past half-century. But in the run-up to the presidential election, his relations with the media had worsened. Except for a couple of news channels, the entire media was at the receiving end of the presidential indignation. And the CNN had been trolled to oblivion. 

As he entered his home, he found Ms. Koko Lupita, their Washington reporter waiting. Lupita was a Ugandan beauty contestant who got a University of Florida postgraduate scholarship for studying media. 
Now with CNN, she was a gifted wordsmith and her acerbic reports on police atrocities on the African-Americans had won plaudits. She was cherished by the CNN editorial board.

As President Trump kept hollering CNN, Ms. Lupita was roped in prime time so that the depravity of the garrulous president could be featured in a prominent public perception. She had anchored the yesterday night-report in which President Trump’s ostentatious life and strikingly manicured golf courses were lampooned.

Her scruffy hair manifested negroid descent. President Trump was game to demean women who tried to touch his pride. Trump posted these nasty words on his Twitter handle in the late-night-hours and by morning the internet had gone berserk.

The tweet was in itself eruptive enough and with the misnaming of the celebrated anchor, in that detestable now nationally infamous Trumpian manner, it lingered online for a couple of days. The media was dismayed and the partisan elite cried foul. The average American was regaled as usual.

But no one had any idea of the pain and humiliation of Ms. Lupita for she was dating the stock consultant nephew of the CNN boss and their engagement was on the cards. She was at a loss to reconcile the veneer of the super white fiance with her ‘sandpaper crotch’. She was inconsolable.

The amiable wife of the CNN boss poured whisky in a wine glass, reached the troubled girl, lifted her chin like a doting mother, and said, ‘‘This is nothing personal, sweetie… it's a professional hazard.’’  Lupita sobbed, ‘‘It is plain outrageous, even dictator Idi Amin didn't go that low, back home, in those dark days of our country.’’

Mr. Morrison soothed her, ‘’No one can be a dictator here, this president of the United States is an animal.’’",Novel : AnkleBiter by Raj Sharma,North America

199,"The Korean movie ""Parasite"" just won best picture and it's getting a ton of new interest from the English speaking world. There is a movie from East Asia (not Japan but Korea) also named ""Parasite"" in the English translation, sometimes spelled ""Parasyte"", and i got really confused trying to find the latter. 

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3345472/

Now I would say Japanese culture is just as foreign to America as Korean culture, with both Japan and Korea having similarities due to historical interactions and proximity. Now obviously they are distinct and I don't mean to brush over any anger Koreans have with Japan over historical oppression, but they had a pretty intense cultural exchange as well, and they both speak foreign non-English East-Asian languages (without dubs for the most part), yet have noteworthy interest from English speaking countries. 

They are kind of like the Asian equivalent of what we see in Canada with the English and French parts of the country. To a non-Canadian, there are probably quite a few similarities between those two different groups. Is that fair to say? I'd like perspectives from any English speaking US/Canadian citizens, as well as anyone with ancestry from Korea or Japan.",Is this a fair comparison from a North American English-speaking perspective?,North America

435,"Im currently studying in Canada and my girlfriend lives in Florida. I've heard a lot of complains about the current educations and there are some points that i still cant comprehend why is it still a thing.

Some of my teachers who i have studied with are as good of a teacher and enthusiastic as they can get, but still being payed average wage despite having 5 years of continuous above average feedback. The only reason i know this was when i accidentally hear her and her friends getting angry over their previous jobs in public schools (i attended private school). It's very unfair imo that good teachers dont get paid as well considering how important their jobs are. I've also seen teachers who fake being enthusiastic about their jobs (they previously was), and grow toxic over years. I think they deserve higher average salary so that they can take off the financial stresses in order to improve their performance in teaching. No wonder a lot of teachers apply to work in international schools oversea in Asia, the demand is not only high but also they dont have to worry as much about money since the living standard is usually lower (they usually get paid in USD, much higher currency value than most Asian countries). I know the example of Finland sounds cliche but if their social status and salary is the same as higher education degree (ie master) then there will be a significant performance improve in the new generation (https://redd.it/2bxgoi). 

The entire textbook industry is not for the poor. If you buy textbook on the market what are the chances that you will see the name Pearson/McGraw-Hill that simply ""own"" the market. Pearson is the equivalent of Comcast in education considering tests and textbooks are from them (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6lyURyVz7k). Of course since they own the market, their textbook price is high above the sky. Depending on contents and subjects, a paperback copy per book can range from 100 to 300 dollars per SUBJECT. So for some subjects that requires a lot of reading such as Biology and History, you are left but no choice to use the textbook. Good thing that a lot of professors and teachers know about this and trying to think of alternatives. No wonder people try to pirate books. Nowadays as we move to digital learning the need for textbook for some subjects are no longer there. In my Computer Sciences and Math courses i have never been ask to buy textbook because it is REQUIRED. If a student is on student loan and/or coming from a difficult background, buying textbooks is detrimental to their future. Im no economist but people cant just let Pearson owns the market like this. I understand that knowledge is valuable but there are different ways of acquiring it.

My gf in Florida complained to me about how her mom and grandparents wanting to get a home-school to get a GED. But they found abeka.com and try to get her to study it. What Abeka is is basically a brain-washing library of Christian cringe where they teach creationism and everything under god's rule. It wasnt a thing in Michigan where she used to live but they moved to Florida. The fact that this still exist legally and profiting off of people is preposterous. When a parent's belief basically brainwash their own children and take over their life, how's this not detrimental to their forming belief and moral? Im not saying we should take away people's children, im saying that everything that is scientifically wrong shouldnt be taught to children. Sadly people are taking science for granted nowadays. We're being taught to regurgitate whatever we learn on the final test and putting numbers in the formula. We're focusing too much on the final test that everything we learn depends on how to perform on the finals. It was even worse after No Child Left Behind. No wonder not as many people thrive for higher education. Surely tests serve as benchmarks, but isnt there another practical method such as a hands-on project to show what we have learnt? Rarely any course is oriented this way. In most cases we are left with the final test that can take more than 60% of our mark. But im no educator nor psychologist so there might be other ways.

All in all, education will need more funding from federal government if we do not wish to have another generation of disappointment like i am. Good thing we do see this trend in Canada (https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/education-spending-in-canada-whats-actually-happening.pdf) but im not sure about US.

tldr: More education funding

- Teachers deserve higher pay

- Textbook industry is making education more difficult

- Outlaw teachings that is scientifically wrong

- Dont make final test the final goal of education

436,"My ex and i have been  together for 3 years. We broke up for 3 months and we decided to see each other and he told me how much he missed me and how he wanted me back in his life, but over the next couple of weeks he changed he has a bad habit of changing his personality based on who he is around. After he wanted on this self discovering journey he decided he cant be with one person. He has to have multiple people, I done my research and this isn't the person i fell in love with. He has become obsessed with the idea of being spiritual. He told me he will be having sex with other people but yet he loves me more than anything. The more I listened to him the more it broke my heart because tbis is something he would never do.. And im not ready to have him sleep with other people i keep hoping maybe when he is around other females he will realize his love for me, I told him it would hurt me but until it happens in not ready to face it because it will hurt me. So basically he will have mutiple partners, but i am the only one he is seeing rigjt now even though he has mutiple chances. We have a very special love i always thought but now it's breaking me down. I'm scared to let him go, but i am also scared to hear he is seeing other people. When we are together we act like boyfriend and girlfriend and he isn't seeing anyone else its just i feel at any moment he would meet someome and have a better relationship. He said he loves me more than anyone and he doubts he will ever love someone like me. He also was up with his friends at the university and he didn't touch one person.

475,"First off, any actual NatSoc or WN should generally˟ avoid joining **any** of the currently-existing national groups or organizations. In the parlance of /pol/, they are all namefaggy and addicted to the rush of e-celeb fame, and many of them are very, very soft on the JQ, being either accepting of direct Jewish involvement in their organization, or prone to expelling people in their groups who speak about the JQ, or willing to tolerate people who race-mix with Jews.

That last point, tolerance of mixers, applies very specifically to anyone that keeps a close association with TheRightStuff (""TRS""). The story of Mike pEiNOviCH and the ""Yid-Wife Crisis"" is out there in plain sight for anyone to research; a person who is aware of it, and still chooses to closely associate with TRS, is self-evidently not serious about being NatSoc or WN, or even, when it comes down to it, about being pro-White. This includes Identity Evropa, NPI, and a few others. People who are seriously on TEAM WHITE don't let people married to Jewesses into their circle of trust.

Consider also that the more LARP in general that the group seems to be, the less mentally stable the members of said group are. You don't want ""edgy"" kids that might convert to mohammedanism and then kill you to be members of your group. That may sound strange to say, but it did actually happen. LARPy organizations such as the Oath Keepers aka ""Oath Cucks""  and the various ""militias"" and other ""muh constitution"" groups are full of Feds, be aware, the infiltrators in such groups will try to instigate and then sting the less thoughtful of the groups' members, this happens all the time and recently made the news in Kansas. Do not be fooled into thinking that an ""Oath Cuck""-like organization that just happens to be ""racist"" is going to be any different from the ""civic"" versions of those groups. If the group you're thinking about joining runs around the woods in camo, or lights crosses or swastikas at their cookouts, then there are plenty of alphabets inside them. Avoid.

IMO the future of the movement is in nameless small-cell groups which act completely legally, through propaganda and persuasion and infiltration, without any LARPy aspects. Said groups do network, but do not create firm ties to any other groups. These groups aren't social clubs, they actually do things IRL, and not LARPy bullshit, but useful things.

Every single NatSoc or WN in America (or anywhere, actually) should be distributing physical propaganda IRL. Anyone can put up posters, distribute leaflets, put fliers on car windshields in parking lots, and generally keep their anonymity if they wish. They can do so without the entire group participating in each stunt, or even alone if they're not a member of a group.I've put out hundreds of fliers on car windshields this week alone, and a group doing it can either cover large events or do several towns at a time in a campaign. Posters, leaflets, and windshield fliers can do a lot of different things. 

(1) They can advise legal actions to the reader, such as reporting illegals to ICE and providing them with the tip-line phone number (866-DHS-2ICE) or web address, or reporting suspicious anti-American activity, such as might be noticed near a Mosque or Islamic Center, to the FBI. They can even troll while still advising legal action, such as a flier saying ""Need your Ex out of your life? Call us!"" put on cars near women's shelters or in Hispanic neighborhoods and using the numeric version of the ICE number (866-347-2423) for the contact.

(2) They can contain redpills which are potent, but which don't necessarily have to incendiary. For the most part, the swastikas etc. should be saved for online or Twitter pilling, but much of the material used online could be converted to printed memes.

(3) They can simply encourage your fellow White people to wake up and take pride in being White! This type of campaign is incredibly effective even if it's not in the least bit ""anti"" any non-White group. Simply saying that Whites should form families and raise White children makes you literally Hitler in the eyes of the lying press and the the Marxists and their followers, but when something like that makes the news, the cognitive dissonance between what is ON the poster, and what the press CALLS the poster (racist, nazi, homophobe), tends to wake a few normies up.

Groups should also be working together to infiltrate and subvert political organizations. For example, your college GOP club, or your county GOP group, or any GOP-leaning media organization. Once in, work on both slowly redpilling the youth currently in the group and also on recruiting other NatSoc and WN types into the group.  These clubs and groups are simple to join and if you have a talent for fundraising or a willingness to go knock on doors, then you will be in like Flynn. Hide your power level for the most part while doing this.

Groups are also good for coordinating ops online. This is obvious, or should be. This can also be done without a group, though, and /pol/ (fullchan not cuckchan) is one of the best places for anonymous coordination.

˟ An exception to this general rule is if you're joining such a group in order to infiltrate and subvert them into being fully NatSoc or WN. This is possibly a tougher roe to hoe than subverting a local GOP club, for two reasons, first because they're national, and second, because the type of national org that is soft on the JQ is not, unlike the GOP clubs doing it out of ignorance. No, those guys know exactly what they're doing by being soft.","""Q: As an American recently becoming NatSoc or WN, what can I do and what groups should I join in order to help the Pro-White movement?""
